(2021) The name of this wine translates to 'Stony Hill', the grapes coming from the rockiest slopes on the Banfi estate in Tuscany. Currants and fresh red berries on the nose, little oak influence if any, just a touch of dusty green olive from the Cabernet component. Plenty of cherry-ripe sweetness on the palate, blackberries too, combining some fruit depth with fresher, lightly herbal notes. Plenty of creamy sweetness here with a sour tang of orange to the acidity.                                    "

(2019) A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Sangiovese, this is a perfumed and very pleasing red, a touch of herbs and graphite, the ripeness of black Cabernet fruit, and the tangy vibrancy of Sangiovese cherries all present and correct. In the mouth there is a sweet and creamy edge to this, substantial but with a creamy softness to the tannins and acidity that give it enough structure while leaving it pizza and spag-bol friendly.

A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with cherry cola, sweet fruit, spice and dried rosemary aromas. It is easy-drinking and bright, with a touch of fruity sweetness on the finish.                                    "

Not a bad entry-level Tuscan red; it shows sweet bubble gum and LifeSaver aromas with just enough darkness to make it nice. Very young and cheeky in the mouth, meaning it's kind of hard, tannic and scratchy. But it's also fully ripe, thus with pizza or spaghetti it won't hurt at all.                                    "

(2001) Jammy, sweet, blackcurranty nose that is ripe and lush. Theres a nice zing of acidity running through the palate, very cherryish but theres a dark, more dusty black fruit too. Good mouthfeel and nice balance giving good length. Very good - a 50/50 Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon blend.                                    "

Good sour-cherry fruit and more sweet oak, with firm tannins and prominent lemon acidity. Creamy consistency. Finish is quite long, but full of drying tannins.                                    "

(2020) Who doesn't love a wine like this occasionally? Is it red or rosé? Well, that's a moot point but it's nice to include this cherry-pink wine here as it certainly captures the summery spirit of rosé wines. This Piedmont wine is gently sparkling and off-dry, a counterpoint to the low alcohol Moscatos of the region with only 7% abv. Made from the Brachetto grape grown in the town of Acqui Terme, the wine is stored 0°C in Banfi’s 19th century cellars. It is frothy and offer a gorgeous pot-pourri of liquidised strawberry, pepper and sherbet with a touch of dark chocolate to boot. Mouthfilling, creamy and sweet, that pulpy strawberry sundae sweetness is balanced by just the right level of acidity and a hint of stemmy earthiness, into a long finish. Perfect summer in garden stuff.                                    "

Brachetto d'Acqui is a sweet, red sparkling wine that would pair with white chocolate desserts, pecan pie or moist chocolate chip cookies. It's an easy, fruity wine with loads of berry, cassis and raspberry on the sweet finish.                                    "

Aromas of fresh summer fruits are countered by an earthy note whose contribution is questionable. Light on the palate with nice strawberry fruit but turns a bit cloying on the finish. Mousse lacks persistence. Drink now.                                    "

A berry cornucopia with bursting raspberry, strawberry and blueberry—just like a good Brachetto d'Acqui should be. Also typical of this style of sweet, sparkling wine with low alcohol is its soda pop fizz in the mouth and spicy finish. Imported by Banfi Vintners.                                    "

Heavy on the rose petal and raspberry compote aromas, and also heavy on the palate. Yes, there's definitely a touch of cherry cough syrup to this red sparkler. To enjoy this you have to like yours sweet; maybe best with a custard dessert or vanilla ice cream. It's too sweet and candied for chocolate.                                    "

This rosé sparkler is very sweet, as it's meant to be, with cherry and strawberry aromas and flavors. The sweetness would be more palatable if it were supported by higher acidity, but here it's like the juice in frozen strawberries.

Banfi’s Bolgeri vineyard produced a ‘Bordeaux’ wine made mostly from Cabernet Sauvignon with an addition of Cabernet Franc. The color is very bold with dark reflections, while the aroma is intense with warm notes of cinchona on an aromatic bed of ripe fruit and the classic verdant scents. There is also some intense vanilla and evolving notes of cacao from the wood. The mouthfeel is intense with a nice attack that then lingers a little too long on the tannins, creating a texture that today is a littl e fleshy.

(2022) I last tasted this wine in the 2019 vintage, and while scoring it exactly the same - 88 points out of 100 - then it's price was £12.99 and I liked it enough to make it Wine of the Week. This cuvée is very similar, an unoaked white wine with a distinct pear and peach fruit character, a hint of talcum, and a certain solidity and intensity of flavour and texture that is quite mouth-filling and yet crisp. It is subtle without making a great impact in either aromatics or flavour. There's nothing wrong with subtlety, but now that the price has risen to £18 I am slightly more reserved about the wine I must say. £12.99 is still in the ballpark of where I could have given it more whole-hearted approval: it is a very good, example, but for me not distinctive enough to ask £18.00.

(2021) Though Banfi is headquartered in Montalcino, the Vermentino grapes for this wine come from more coastal vineyards in the Maremma region of Tuscany. It's a delicate, perfumed style of crisp white wine, notes of talcum and peach down, a touch of elderflower in the background. In the mouth it has that combination that many Italian whites from the centre of the country share (Verdicchio, Vernaccia), of intensity and subtley. There is plenty of stony mineral salts acidity but gentle and clean citrus fruit, just a hint of that peachier quality on the mid-palate.

(2019) In Italy it's name is Pinot Grigio, but the grape variety is also known as Pinot Gris in France, and in recent decades world wine producers who grow and bottle the variety have tended to use these terms as a sort of short-hand for style - sometimes even quality. It's fair to say that the reputation of Italian Pinot Grigio has suffered from cheap, over-cropped and commercial wines that have become the staple of by-the-glass white wine in pubs and bars, the fairly indiscriminate choice of people who just want ""an inofessive glass of white."" So Pinot Grigio - as opposed to Gris - has an arguably deserved poor reputation among some wine lovers, but that does a huge diservice to many very good, very carefully made examples from the variety's heartland in the north of Italy, but also wines like this, made much further south, in Tuscany. Banfi's Grigio comes from vineyards in the southern part of Montalcino, and has genuine fruit sweetness and ripeness (rather than residual sugar) and a fair degree of concentration. Fleshy stone fruits and citrus on the nose lead on to an expansive palate, with Ogen melon and more lemon rind weight and citrus intensity, the acidity gentle but persistent, giving this easy drinking appeal for sure, but a bit of class, weight and authority too. A very nice example.                                    "
