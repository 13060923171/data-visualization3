Subtle aromas of scorched earth, forest floor and mature berries mingle with a eucalyptus note. The full-bodied palate features cherry marinated in spirits, prune, roasted coffee bean and licorice framed in close-grained tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close. While it reflects the heat of the vintage, it also shows polish and restraint. Kerin O’Keefe                                    "

(2020) I haven't tasted Banfi's Brunello since the 2000 vintage, an excellent wine that I scored 92. This comes from an official 'five star' vintage, and Banfi predict it will cellar well for 20 to 30 years. It is 100% Sangiovese, the vineyard hand-harvested three or four times to select the ripest fruit, and aged only in large format oak barrels. There's an earthy, dried blood tone to the colour, and a spicy, Sandalwood and cedar component on the nose, some Chinese dried plums and a fresh cherry note. In the mouth the sweet ripeness of the fruit is delicious, a succulent fleshy plum note, but the grip, the spice, and the tight tannin framework does indeed suggest significant ageability. Many stockists are selling by the six-bottle case at time of review, but more will be moving on to this vintage.                                    "

The nose is fruity, gourmand, racy and offers a slight fleshiness. It reveals notes of wild strawberry, crushed raspberry and small notes of boysenberry / blueberry, ripe red berries associated with slight touches of liquorice, colas as well as slight hints of chocolate and sweet tobacco. The palate is fruity, mineral, fresh, well-balanced, elegant and offers a slight acid frame, a slight juiciness, a slight tension / straightness, a good structure as well as a beautiful definition.

(2020) From the vineyards that surround the Poggio alle Mura castle, this spent two years in French oak, plus a further three in bottle. It has a deep red colour, but a little paleness on the rim, then a deep and quite curranty aroma, some volatile lift, and cherry fruit beneath. In the mouth it is smooth and sweetly-fruited, there is liquorice, and again that intense raisined quality. Taut and juicy, the finish has a purity, with oak subsumed by the sweet fruit and elegance of the tannins and acidity.                                    "

The palate is mineral, ample, well-structured, complex and dense. In the mouth it expresses notes of ripe fruit, cherry, plum and blueberry associated with cassis and slight notes of spices (in the background) and a touch of licorice on the finish.

A real thoroughbred. The color is an intense ruby-garnet with few concessions. The aroma is outstanding with orange peel, spice, prunes, an intense floral component of violets, bergamot, tamarind, tobacco and a light, refreshing, balsamic greenish nuance. The attack is wonderful, dense and elegant, with excellent tannins that are elegant and settled. The acidity is discreet yet present, while the finish its perfect thanks to its persistence and intensity. The retro-nasal return is also excellent, impeccably defined between its floral and dark spice components.                                    "

This could very well be the best Poggio all'Oro of all time. It reaped the benefits of new fermentation technology used in the cellar. The nice, intense ruby color is not dark and holds up well on the edge. The aroma is broad with intense fruity scents, various ripening stages of cherry and morello cherry, and the fruity streak is enhanced by ripe blackberry, while the innovative use of wood is discreetly evident in the slightly smoky tone. The fresh, balsamic vein and yellow peach indicate a hot year. The flavor is magnificent and always elegant, part of this wine's DNA. The delicate and compact tannins are excellent, youthful yet well-behaved. The body is compact and acidity nice, all contributing to an excellent, fleshy and persistent finish.                                    "

This vintage truly reaps the benefits of aging. The rains of early September had a lot of producers worried but those who were brave enough to delay their harvest until the wonderful weather in October obtained great results. Banfi waited and the results were excellent. The color is a lovely ruby with intense garnet nuances, while the aroma is sharp, broad and full, centered on scents that are still fruity with citrus accents of bergamot, tamarind and cherry, with a light spiciness from the wood and sweet Ecuadorian chocolate. There is also some mulberry and tobacco. The flavors is, as always, intense with a nice acidity which here is more suppressed than the 1993, while the tannins are delicate, settled and elegant. Great finesse and taste progression with a finish that is not muscular but very persistent.                                    "

In my view this very young Brunello that comes out this year shows how much Banfi believes in research. Dealing with such a hot year was no easy task but Banfi came up with the goods. The classic ruby color is nicely concentrated and compact. The aroma is broad, clean and intense with a distinct scent of yellow peach along with red fruit and blackberry, slightly jammy and under spirits, without being sickly sweet. A slight vein of bramble and an intriguing green nuance complete the picture. The taste is quite bold and alcoholic, but in a good way. The young and intense tannins are still rampant but of excellent quality, while the acidity is surprising for such a hot year. The progression is rich, intense and muscular and it is in the finish that the full boldness of the wine is felt, even if it could be a little more elegant. Young.

Its intense garnet color has a consistent edge while the aroma holds up with nice evolved notes of leather, damp underbrush, a touch if licorice and slightly ethereal tones. There are also the classic scents of dried prunes and bergamot. As always the taste is nicely held up and articulated with tannins that are present but composed and not aggressive. The attack is interesting, quite dense, distinct with its touch of sapidity that allows for a progression that is very elegant and still whole. In the finish there is a return of licorice and bergamot, a nice taste-aroma combination.                                    "

The color is an orange-ruby with small garnet nuances, very minimal considering its age. The aroma is decidedly complex with evolve scents of tamarind and tobacco and some very interesting balsamic ones. The fruity streak is a bit spent but the peach syrup and lichees are still present. The taste is excellent, centered on tannins that are dense yet still exuberant. A typical trait of wine-making at the time. The progression is good and compact with a richness that compensates for the tannins and offers a flavor that is still lively and rewarding.

(2021) Banfi's Rosso is aged for around 12 months, partly in French oak barriques and partly in large Slavonian oak casks. The nose is vinous and dark, but reveals very little about the wine initially. In the mouth it is powerful and savoury, edged with bitter cherry and with a plummy character, the tannins are quite finely grained but grippy, and the classic Italianate bite of the acidity joins the finish. This could be cellared for a few years or decanted if opening now perhaps. Note Majestic may be stocking the 2019 in some stores, but their 'mix six' price is a sharp £16.99.

Here is a very attractive Chianti Classico from Banfi (of Brunello di Montalcino fame) with a rich bouquet of cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. It is a delicate wine with background shadings of Spanish cedar and root beer that linger on the finish.                                    "

(2006) Castello Banfi's 2003 is a blend of 90 per cent Sangiovese with 10 per cent of Canaiolo/Colorino. It spends a relatively short three months in Slavonian oak, but the initial impression on the nose is of spicy, cedary, tobacco and toast, though a fine, pure, cherry-fruited concentration begins to show throw. On the palate there's a slightly raw edge to this wine, but it has good fruit and a creamy ripeness in the mouth, with soft, generous tannin structure and just enough acidity to balance.

A basic wine that's in proportion. The bouquet offers bacon, menthol and rubber along with nuances of espresso and modest complexity. Boysenberry and blackberry flavors carry notes of cinnamon and vanilla, while the feel is soft yet substantive. Not a thriller, but eminently drinkable.                                    "

(2002) A lovely warmth of briarwood and tobacco on the nose over cherry fruit. Lots of crisp acidity on the palate, with keen-edged cherries and a light-bodied juiciness. Savoury, with elegant length, this is a modern but restrained style that is solid, but doesn't really excite.                                    "

Extremely fascinating showing notes of calendula, gorse, linden blossom, camphor and cut cedar. There's more in the background with the alternation between walnut husks, green tea leaves and rosemary which in a subtle yet essential way give a mediterranean imprint to the matrix.

A wine projected to age over time, it will need a long time to truly come out with all of its expressitivity. Better from 2025.                                    "

Castello Banfi's delicious Cum Laude is a super Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah that opens with rich aromas of black fruit and chocolate fudge. TheCabernet Sauvignon component adds background notes of exotic spice, moist tobacco and firm tannins.                                    "

A food-friendly blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah, Cum Laude offers attractive notes of milk chocolate and creamy cherry over a rich, plump mouthfeel. Meat dishes or pasta al forno with a crunchy cheese topping would fit the bill.                                    "

Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah produce a sophisticated and refined blend that boasts fantastic power and intensity. The wine is dark, chewy, rich and bursting with flavors of mature berry, spice, cola, leather and tobacco.                                    "

This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks. But in three years it should become a good to very good table wine.                                    "

Quite candied, with aromas of red licorice, cassis and boysenberry syrup. A true berry ball, with forward fruit, a sweet and easy finish, and mild tannins. Laudable for its zippy qualities, but could use more structure.                                    "

(2021) The name of this wine translates to 'Stony Hill', the grapes coming from the rockiest slopes on the Banfi estate in Tuscany. Currants and fresh red berries on the nose, little oak influence if any, just a touch of dusty green olive from the Cabernet component. Plenty of cherry-ripe sweetness on the palate, blackberries too, combining some fruit depth with fresher, lightly herbal notes. Plenty of creamy sweetness here with a sour tang of orange to the acidity.                                    "

(2019) A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Sangiovese, this is a perfumed and very pleasing red, a touch of herbs and graphite, the ripeness of black Cabernet fruit, and the tangy vibrancy of Sangiovese cherries all present and correct. In the mouth there is a sweet and creamy edge to this, substantial but with a creamy softness to the tannins and acidity that give it enough structure while leaving it pizza and spag-bol friendly.

Kirsche, Cassis, im Duft reintönig und klar. Am Gaumen mit viel Saft und einer ausgewogenen Struktur, eher mild im Tannin, ein angenehmer Tischwein zu Antipasti (z.?B. grilliertem Gemüse). Ulrich Sautter                                    "

A blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with cherry cola, sweet fruit, spice and dried rosemary aromas. It is easy-drinking and bright, with a touch of fruity sweetness on the finish.                                    "

Not a bad entry-level Tuscan red; it shows sweet bubble gum and LifeSaver aromas with just enough darkness to make it nice. Very young and cheeky in the mouth, meaning it's kind of hard, tannic and scratchy. But it's also fully ripe, thus with pizza or spaghetti it won't hurt at all.                                    "

(2001) Jammy, sweet, blackcurranty nose that is ripe and lush. Theres a nice zing of acidity running through the palate, very cherryish but theres a dark, more dusty black fruit too. Good mouthfeel and nice balance giving good length. Very good - a 50/50 Sangiovese/Cabernet Sauvignon blend.                                    "

(1999) Ruby/cherry red. Bright. Subdued but attractive nose with zippy cherry and raspberry fruit and sweet vanillin. Savoury on the palate. Good sour-cherry fruit and more sweet oak, with firm tannins and prominent lemon acidity. Creamy consistency. Finish is quite long, but full of drying tannins.                                    "
