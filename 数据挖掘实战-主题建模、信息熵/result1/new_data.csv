This includes improving factory layouts, covering roof space with solar panels & leveraging AI to improve how we use energy.

We also reduced water use in vehicle manufacturing by 15% year over year & currently use less water per vehicle than almost any ICE carmaker.

—

We support responsible mining & refining.

Specifically:

- We source directly from mining & refining companies. Avoiding the middleman enables more transparent & easily traceable supply chain data.

- We use external mining initiatives & expect suppliers to undergo independent audits.

In addition, vertical integration & regionalization help us have more control over supply.

None of our batteries go to landfills—at the end of their usable life, we recycle them to build brand-new battery packs.

—

Product affordability is fundamental to our mission.

The more products we sell, the more we move in the needle in favor of a sustainable future. Model 3 is the first EV to be priced on-par with ICE vehicle equivalents.

Tesla vehicles are engineered to be the safest in the world.

By collecting anonymous data from 4M+ vehicles in our fleet & replicating real-world accidents, we’re able to make current & future vehicles even safer.

2022 Highlights

Last year, our customers avoided releasing about 13.4 million metric tons of CO2e into our atmosphere 🌎

Tesla vehicle emissions are significantly lower vs ICE vehicles. This will continue to improve as the grid gets cleaner, while the carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year.

After 17 years of driving—the average life of a vehicle in the US—a single Tesla will avoid almost 55 tons of CO2e.

Also, the Supercharger network continues to be 100% renewable. This was achieved via onsite resources & annual renewable matching.",tesla exists accelerate transition sustainable energy impact report highlight customer avoided releasing metric ton atmosphere tesla vehicle emission lower ice vehicle continue improve grid cleaner carbon impact ice vehicle remains driving average life vehicle single tesla avoid ton supercharger network continues renewable achieved onsite resource annual renewable matching,"{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.3182}",0.3182,0.12,0.16,0.721,pos,5.152569011092753,"[(2, 0.98289776)]",2
