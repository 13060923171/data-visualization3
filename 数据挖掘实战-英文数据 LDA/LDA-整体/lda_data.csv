89409,StarBiz,14,23/12/2019,Think tank: China should step up regulation of AI in finance,,"BEIJING: China should introduce a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence in the finance industry, and enhance technology used by regulators to strengthen industry-wide supervision, policy advisers at a leading think tank said yesterday.
“We should not deify artificial intelligence as it could go wrong just like any other technology,” said the former chief of China’s securities regulator, Xiao Gang, who is now a senior researcher at the China Finance 40 Forum.
“The point is how we make sure it is safe for use and include it with proper supervision,” Xiao told a forum in Qingdao on China’s east coast.
Technology to regulate intelligent finance – referring to banking, securities and other financial products that employ technology such as facial recognition and big-data analysis to improve sales and investment returns – has largely lagged development, showed a report from the China Finance 40 Forum.
Evaluation of emerging technologies and industry-wide contingency plans should be fully considered, while authorities should draft laws and regulations on privacy protection and data security, the report showed.
Lessons should be learned from the boom and bust of the online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sector where regulations were not introduced quickly enough, said economics professor Huang Yiping at the National School of Development of Peking University.
China’s P2P industry was once widely seen as an important source of credit, but has lately been undermined by pyramid-scheme scandals and absent bosses, sparking public anger as well as a broader government crackdown.
“Changes have to be made among policy makers,” said Zhang Chenghui, chief of the finance research bureau at the Development Research Institute of the State Council. — Reuters",china introduce regulatory framework artificial intelligence finance industry enhance technology regulator industry wide supervision policy adviser tank yesterday artificial intelligence wrong technology chief china security regulator gang senior researcher china finance forum safe proper supervision xiao forum qingdao china east coast technology regulate intelligent finance banking security financial product technology facial recognition data analysis sale investment return development report finance forum evaluation technology industry wide contingency plan authority law regulation privacy protection data security report lesson boom bust online peer lending sector regulation economics professor huang national school development university china industry source credit pyramid scheme scandal absent boss public anger government crackdown policy maker chenghui chief finance bureau development institute council reuters,"[(2, 0.99237955)]",2
87317,StarBiz,5,18/12/2019,Son makes a pitch for Japan-led Asia AI superpower,,"TOKYO: SoftBank Group Corp founder Masayoshi Son has a solution to Japan’s decades-long economic malaise. Not surprisingly, it involves artificial intelligence (AI).
Japan can boost growth by joining with India and South-East Asian countries in creating a common AI platform, Son told scientists and government bureaucrats who gathered in Tokyo yesterday for the government’s Moonshot symposium. He envisions Japan taking a leading role and believes the combined populations and markets could give the countries a fighting chance against the behemoths of China and the United States, which share the lead in AI, he said.
“This is the moonshot,” Son said, drawing laughter with a slide that showed a graph of Japanese gross domestic product climbing steeply to exceed those of China and the United States. “If we can achieve this, the result will be amazing.”
As the first country to confront intractable problems of an ageing society, Japan should focus on autonomous driving and DNA-centric medicine as solutions to rising traffic accidents involving the elderly and soaring medical costs, Son said. South-East Asian countries should join Japan in creating a shared data bank and developing an “AI engine”, he said. Son didn’t explain what he meant by that nor say why developing countries would want to help the wealthy neighbour with its first-world problems.
“If we create Asia’s number one platform, that is a big potential,” Son said.
While many venture capitalists view Son’s sermons about the coming AI age as nothing more than marketing, the billionaire is already pushing his own companies to prepare for the future where every industry is redefined by the technology. Last month, SoftBank announced plans to combine its Yahoo Japan Internet business with Line Corp, Japan’s biggest messaging service. The complex deal on his home turf is supposed to create a national champion that can more effectively compete with global rivals like Google and Amazon.com Inc.
Son is as bullish as ever on AI even as his investment strategy has come under fire. SoftBank’s Vision Fund had to write down the value of its ride-hailing portfolio, which includes China’s Didi Chuxing Inc, India’s Ola and Singapore’s Grab Holdings Ltd after Uber Technologies Inc fell more than 30% following its listing in May. Son also lost billions of dollars after pouring money into WeWork, a company that has no discernible AI technology but plenty of hurdles as it tries to turn a profit.
The hype around self-driving cars has died down recently after a number of deadly crashes in cars on AI autopilot made it clear that true autonomy may be many years away. Still, Son said robotaxis can already do better than senior citizens. He played a video of an autonomous vehicle from Cruise, a General Motors Co self-driving unit where SoftBank has invested US$2.25bil, navigating San Francisco’s crowded streets.
“If you are still doubting the capability of autonomous driving, this is already today,” he said. — Bloomberg",tokyo corp founder masayoshi son solution japan decade economic malaise artificial intelligence japan boost growth india south east asian country common platform son scientist government bureaucrat tokyo yesterday government symposium envisions role combined population market country chance behemoth china share lead moonshot son laughter slide japanese gross domestic product steeply exceed china united achieve result amazing country confront intractable society japan autonomous dna centric medicine solution traffic accident elderly medical cost south east asian country japan data bank engine son meant country neighbour create asia platform potential son venture capitalist son sermon age marketing billionaire company future industry technology month plan japan internet business corp japan biggest service complex deal turf create national champion compete global rival amazon son bullish investment strategy fire softbank vision fund ride portfolio china didi india ola singapore grab holding uber technology son billion dollar money wework company discernible technology plenty hurdle hype driving car deadly crash car true autonomy son robotaxis senior citizen video autonomous vehicle cruise motor unit softbank bil san francisco street capability autonomous bloomberg,"[(2, 0.5456828), (3, 0.44977224)]",2
87431,Main,21,18/12/2019,AI Robot to stop online fraudsters,Service will warn potential victims of suspicious activity via voice and text,"BEIJING: An artificial intelligence service designed to prevent people from being defrauded was unveiled after a successful pilot programme.Called the AI Robot, the online service –released by the criminal investigation bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and designed by internet giant Alibaba – can warn residents about suspicious online activity through its voice or text system.
For example, if police detect that a phone number is frequently used by con artists, the service will call potential victims, warning them that information they received about money transfers is fraudulent. According to the bureau, people can see a special anti-fraud number for the police on their phone.
“The AI technology can help us save manpower and improve our work efficiency, and it can also keep people out of fraud traps more quickly than we can,” said Liu Zhongyi, the bureau’s head.
The service has successfully aided police in preventing more than 3,000 people each day from being swindled since the pilot programme was launched in some public security bureaus on Nov 15, Liu said.
The service has been extended across the country since Monday.
“If residents ignore the robot’s warning or do not believe the robot, we’ll call the potential victims via our telephone number to save them from the fraud,” said Zhao Wei, a police officer from an anti-fraud centre under the Beijing Public Security Bureau.
As for those likely tricked by swindlers, Zhao said she and her colleagues would talk to them or help them face-to-face.
“Our aim is to prevent people from being cheated as quickly as we can and to help them reduce or avoid economic loss,” she added.
Zheng Junfang, chief platform governance officer of Alibaba, said they technological innovations to assist police officers in fighting fraud and ensuring public security, “because combating fraud requires effort from all walks of life”.

86163,Main,17,13/12/2019,BIG WIN AGAIN FOR MMC GAMUDA,,"LONDON: Fresh from winning two industry awards in November, MMC Gamuda KVMRT (T) Sdn Bhd has bagged the Innovation in Tunnel Excavation award, this time from leading British civil engineering monthly New Civil Engineer (NCE) magazine. The magazine is a flagship publication of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a chartered body that oversees the practice of civil engineering in Britain.
The announcement was made at the NCE Tunnelling Festival last week, where MMC Gamuda’s Autonomous Tunnel Boring Machine (A-TBM) prevailed over five European contenders.
The A-TBM won the NCE judges over with its unprecedented use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) control algorithms to revolutionise tunnelling construction like never before. It is a world’s first, with an automated system that is able to monitor machine data in real time and assume control of various tunnelling construction sub-systems optimally. It has shown faster response times, improved accuracy and tangible productivity benefits resulting in overall safer tunnelling. 
Developed in-house, the A-TBM last won the Technical Product/Equipment Innovation of the Year award at the 2019 International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association (ITA) Tunnelling Awards event at the 8th Annual Cutting-Edge Conference in Miami on Nov 18.
The MMC Gamuda team credited with the success of A-TBM consists of a mostly Malaysian task force made up of Ng Hau Wei (project sponsor), Justin Chin Jing Ho (project lead), Russell Jon Batty (technical lead), John Lim Ji Xiong (lead AI developer) and Sam Liew Kit Shen (lead PLC developer).
“We presented the tunnelling challenges we sought to solve, and demonstrated a clear understanding of how this could be met with our A-TBM. We had to give the specifics of our innovation and how it builds on or differs from other current practices or solutions. Along with this, we explained the processes that drove the development of our innovation, such as highlighting feasibility studies carried out, trials done on other projects, or collaboration with external stakeholders and/or industry bodies,” said Ng on the judging process.
According to Chin, their advisor Gusztav Klados, with an extensive background in tunnelling spanning over 40 years, had piqued their curiosity with his previous experiences encountering a rudimentary TBM automated steering system. 
“He challenged us to develop an auto-steering functionality in-house, given advancements in current technology, especially in computing power. The team was assembled based on their backgrounds where John had prior exposure to AI and machine learning in university before while Sam was already familiar with PLCs as part of his day-to-day electrical engineering job. 
“Russel was appointed to manage technical troubleshooting while I held weekly sessions with John and others to tune and optimise the behaviour of the system so that it would drive the TBMs as we intended it to. In over half a year, we achieved this auto-steering functionality on the TBMs.
“After this initial success, we realised that we could and should try automating more sub-systems of the TBMs, not just the steering. And thus, began the official development of the A-TBM to what it is today. We continued with our weekly sessions to drive the incremental and progressive automation of each sub-system on the TBMs, and this has been going on for the past year and a half,” said Chin, who is also acting general manager for tunnelling. 
 The A-TBM was put to work in the Sungai-Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya (SSP) MRT line of the Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit project, which passes through four distinct geological formations of Kuala Lumpur. 
With MMC Gamuda as the main work package contractor, the autonomous system was deployed into the project TBMs, where all related mining drives this year have been successfully completed with minimal incidents.
This success of the autonomous system echoes the prowess of the variable density TBM introduced by MMC Gamuda in the now completed Sungai-Buloh-Kajang MRT line that hosts seven underground stations.
Back then, the variable density TBM, also a world’s first, tackled Kuala Lumpur’s complex geologies – such as those presented by karstic limestone – in a highly competent manner. For that, the variable density TBM won the Technical Innovation of the Year 2014 Award from the International Tunnelling Association.
“We were extremely gratified to be able to share our story before an enthusiastic audience and collectively uplift the industry in terms of efficiency, constructability, and safety,” said Chin.
“We’re overjoyed at this award, considering that we picked up an award from the ITA last month,” he added. 
For Ng, excellence cannot be separated from hard work. 
“We’ve poured a lot of sweat and tears into this innovation, but it’s ultimately thanks to our stakeholders who entrusted us to deliver the SSP MRT line, which is expected to complete mining works by the second quarter of 2020,” he said.",london fresh industry award mmc gamuda kvmrt sdn bhd innovation tunnel excavation award time british civil engineering civil engineer nce magazine magazine flagship publication institution civil engineer body oversees practice civil engineering britain announcement nce festival week mmc autonomous tunnel boring machine tbm european contender nce judge unprecedented artificial intelligence control revolutionise construction system monitor machine data real time control construction system response time accuracy tangible productivity benefit house tbm technical product equipment innovation international underground space association ita tunnelling award event annual cutting edge conference miami nov mmc gamuda team success tbm malaysian task force hau wei project sponsor justin chin project lead russell jon technical lead john lim xiong lead developer sam kit shen lead plc challenge understanding tbm specific innovation differs current practice solution process development innovation feasibility study trial project external stakeholder industry body process chin advisor gusztav extensive background curiosity previous experience rudimentary tbm system develop auto functionality house advancement current technology power team background john prior exposure machine learning university sam familiar plcs day day electrical engineering job russel manage technical held weekly session tune behaviour system drive tbms half achieved auto functionality initial success system official development tbm weekly session incremental progressive automation system tbms half chin acting manager tbm sungai buloh serdang putrajaya ssp mrt valley mass rapid transit project distinct geological formation lumpur mmc gamuda main package contractor autonomous system project tbms mining drive minimal incident success autonomous system variable density tbm mmc gamuda sungai buloh mrt host underground station variable density tbm kuala lumpur complex geology karstic limestone competent manner variable density technical innovation international association gratified share story enthusiastic audience uplift industry term constructability safety chin award ita month excellence lot sweat tear stakeholder ssp mrt complete mining quarter,"[(2, 0.99658036)]",2

230571,Lifestyle,4,14/12/2020,State of the art AI,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) has already proven capable of producing music and novels, but now a student at Princeton University in the United States has shown that 
it can also create Chinese landscape paintings that are good enough to fool human evaluators – sometimes.As part of her undergraduate research, Alice Xue studied whether a machine could pass a Visual Turing Test by producing images that people cannot tell were made by a machine. 
Xue trained an algorithm using 2,192 traditional Chinese landscape paintings collected from art museums. 
The resulting AI-generated paintings were mistaken for being made by humans 55% of the time.
Xue graduated earlier this year, but the research was just made public in November when published on the online scientific paper repository arXiv. It was first reported in the AI industry publication Synced this week.
The AI algorithm produced the artwork using a machine learning framework model called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
GANs have previously been used for turning photographs into paintings and creating other types of art, some of which have even been sold at auction.
One AI-generated painting from the French art collective Obvious sold for US$432,500 (RM1.75mil) at a Christie’s auction in 2018. 
Like Xue’s AI-generated art, that painting of a man with blurred, indistinguishable facial features was generated by an algorithm trained on thousands of other paintings. 
In this case, it was fed 15,000 portraits from between the 14th and 20th centuries.
Xue’s research was also original in its choice of artwork. 
“Most GAN research focuses on Western art,” Xue wrote in the paper. 
She said this is why she chose to focus on Chinese landscape paintings, which are “just as aesthetically meaningful as Western art”.
For the Visual Turing Test, Xue surveyed 242 participants. The selection process and the participants’ knowledge of art was not specified in the study. 
They were each asked whether they thought a painting was made by a person or computer and how certain they were on a scale of one to 10.
Xue said her algorithm is also unique in its ability to create artwork from beginning to end. 
The traditional GAN-based method of creating artwork tends to produce unoriginal artwork, according to Xue, because it relies on inputs like pre-prepared sketches.
For this research, Xue used a version of the framework called Sketch-and-Paint GAN (SAPGAN). 
This trained the algorithm to make its own sketches of the landscape’s mountains and rivers before painting in the details.
The results, according to Xue, could help lay the groundwork for future machine-made artwork that is truly original. – South China Morning Post",artificial intelligence capable music novel princeton university united create chinese landscape painting human evaluator undergraduate alice xue machine pas visual test image people machine xue algorithm traditional chinese landscape painting museum painting human time xue public online scientific paper repository arxiv industry publication week algorithm artwork machine framework model generative adversarial network gans gans painting type auction french art obvious mil christie auction xue art painting indistinguishable facial feature algorithm trained thousand painting portrait century original choice artwork gan western art xue paper chose focus chinese landscape painting meaningful western art visual turing test xue participant selection process participant art study person computer scale xue algorithm unique ability create artwork traditional gan method artwork unoriginal artwork xue input pre prepared sketch xue version framework sketch paint gan sapgan algorithm sketch landscape river detail xue groundwork future machine artwork original south china morning post,"[(5, 0.99288803)]",5
230581,Lifestyle,6,14/12/2020,AI solves big  biology mystery,The breakthrough could help scientists combat disease and manufacture better drugs.,"FOR decades scientists have been trying to figure out how to swiftly predict the twisting, tangled shape of proteins – and from there unravel a greater understanding of the machinery of life itself.
An Artificial Intelligence program created by firm DeepMind was shown to have virtually cracked the challenge, forecasting the way in which proteins contort into three dimensional structures in the results of a biannual competition that judges hailed as a game changer.
“In some sense the problem is solved,” said John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland who co-founded the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition in 1994, quoted by the journal Nature.
Janet Thornton of the European Bioinformatics Institute said in a statement from the competition organisers that the work to solve the problem was a “triumph of human curiosity, endeavour and intelligence”.
“A better understanding of protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and disease,” said Thornton, who is not affiliated with CASP or DeepMind.
The cells of all living beings contain thousands of proteins, workhorses that catalyse most chemical reactions in the body.
They are essential to life – from muscle function to carrying oxygen in the blood – and are also the key to diseases like cancer and even Covid-19.
A protein is a strand of amino acids, which then crumples into a unique three-dimensional tangle.
It is this shape that directly relates to its function.
Scientists have puzzled for half a century over how to accurately and quickly predict which formation – out of an unfathomably large number of possibilities – a protein might take by looking at its amino acid chain, a process that may take years in the laboratory.
The CASP contest involved around 100 teams who were given the amino acid sequences for dozens of proteins and tasked with estimating their final shapes – which were known to the organisers.
DeepMind – whose program AlphaGo stunned the world in 2016 by beating an elite human player in the complex strategy game Go – was already at the top of the field in the last contest in 2018.
This time the AlphaFold program determined the shape of many of the proteins “to a level of accuracy comparable to that achieved with expensive and time-consuming lab experiments”, according to the CASP organisers.
Medical marvel
Andrei Lupas, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology who was part of the assessment team, told Nature that AlphaFold had helped him determine the structure of a protein that his lab had been trying to pin down for a decade.
“This will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything,” he told Nature.
Derek Lowe, who writes about drug discovery and the pharma industry for Science Translational Medicine, described protein folding as like “watching piles of hinged lumber spontaneously restack themselves into functional boats, wagons and treehouses”.
He said the AlphaFold results did not mean the program would consistently come up with the right protein structure.
“But getting that level of structural accuracy on that many varied proteins is something that has just never been done before.”
DeepMind said it was looking at how the program might help increase knowledge of certain diseases, for example to identify whether a protein has malfunctioned.
“These insights could enable more precise work on drug development, complementing existing experimental methods to find promising treatments faster,” it said in a statement.
The firm added that it was working to produce a peer-
reviewed paper and was “exploring how best to provide broader access to the system”. – AFP",decade scientist shape unravel understanding machinery life artificial intelligence program firm deepmind cracked challenge forecasting protein dimensional structure biannual competition judge game changer sense john moult computational biologist university maryland critical assessment technique structure prediction casp competition journal nature janet thornton european bioinformatics institute statement competition organiser triumph human curiosity intelligence understanding protein ability computer life evolution human health disease thornton casp deepmind cell thousand workhorse catalyse chemical reaction essential life muscle function oxygen blood key disease cancer covid protein strand amino acid crumples unique dimensional tangle shape function scientist half century predict formation protein amino acid chain process laboratory casp contest team acid sequence dozen protein final shape organiser program alphago elite human player complex strategy game top field contest time alphafold program shape protein accuracy comparable expensive time lab experiment organiser medical marvel andrei lupas evolutionary biologist max institute developmental biology assessment team nature alphafold structure protein lab pin decade change medicine change change change nature derek lowe drug discovery pharma industry science translational medicine protein pile restack functional boat treehouses alphafold program structure level structural accuracy protein program increase knowledge protein insight enable precise drug development experimental method treatment statement firm peer paper provide broader access system afp,"[(3, 0.99556375)]",3

The United States maker of networking gear will pay 595 pence (about US$8) a share for the United Kingdom provider of cloud communications software. The cash offer, which includes debt, is expected to close in the first quarter, Cisco said in a statement.
Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins is seeking to recast the company – whose hardware is the backbone of the internet – as a networking software and services provider. He’s responding to an industrywide shift that has seen more of the functions traditionally provided by in-house hardware migrate to outsourcing offered by remote data centres.
Cisco is seeking to push further into automation to improve the way its customers reach out to their end-users, enabling them to make their pitches and services more effective. 
And it wants to add those capabilities to its existing customer-relationship management offerings.
With Iodine, it sees an opportunity to use AI software to automate the outreach process more effectively than is currently possible. For example, it will help customers channel their offerings into the approach that they prefer, such as through text messages, social media or a voice call. 
Another instance is to provide a company representative with more contextual information about the customer they’re dealing with to make sure that they tailor that interaction in a way that the customer wants.
“A great customer relationship is built on consistently enjoyable interactions where every touchpoint on every channel is an opportunity for businesses to deliver rich, engaging and intuitive experiences,” Cisco senior vice-president Jeetu Patel said in the statement.

Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was driving on a highway outside Iran’s capital Teheran with a security detail of 
11 Guards on Nov 27, when the machine gun “zoomed in” on his face and fired 13 rounds, said rear-admiral Ali Fadavi.
The machine gun was mounted on a Nissan pickup and “focused only on martyr Fakhrizadeh’s face in a way that his wife, despite being only 25cm away, was not shot,” Mehr news agency quoted him as saying on Sunday.
It was being “controlled online” via satellite and used an “advanced camera and artificial intelligence” to make the target, he added.
Fadavi said Fakhrizadeh’s head

228031,StarBiz,8,07/12/2020,OFO Tech’s Geo-AI technology offers cost savings,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Utilising Malaysian-based geospatial-artificial intelligence (Geo-AI) technologies, infrastructure and plantation companies have experienced an average cost savings of up to 40% and a stronger topline growth. 
Geo-AI technology is created from an AI and geographic information system based on geographic data – which helps to visualise business objects on maps, improving efficiency and the decision-making abilities of businesses.  
OFO Tech Sdn Bhd managing director Armi Majid told StarBiz that the technology, which uses reality and real-time data, speeds up work and reduces manpower for companies. 
“Companies can even have cost savings of up to 70% after using our Geo-AI technology, as it reduces the time of work compared to using traditional manpower,” he said.
Lowering the cost of deploying the technology, Armi told StarBiz that the technology for business operations is “affordable” and is also offered to companies based on a yearly subscription model. 
“This technology is a saviour for organisations. 
“Our tech solution is affordable and businesses can choose to pay monthly or yearly rather than bearing the full cost of the technology. 
“Our clients have reformed their daily operations by using Geo-AI technology,” he added.
The #digitalXdata 2020 live virtual conference was organised by Star Media Group with OFO Tech as the Gigabyte Partner. 
Its business development director, Muhammad Amsyar Faiz, was a speaker at the Drone Track. 
Amsyar presented on “Drone Powered Solutions and Its Affiliated Technologies; Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Virtual & Augmented Reality, and Industrial IoT Technology – Emerging Trends and Applications.” 
The conference aims to help companies solve business challenges and uncover growth opportunities by redesigning a data-driven digital future.
During the movement control order, Armi noted that the Geo-AI technology was “tremendously” helpful to businesses as site operations were seen through the web platform, which did not require workers to visit the site. 
“Especially with the work from home environment, workers don’t have to go to the site, instead we brought the site to their homes via the Geo-AI technology,” he said. 
As such, Armi disclosed that the company’s sales rose 40% during the Covid-19 period compared to a year ago due to the acceleration of digitisation by infrastructure, construction and plantation companies, as well as additional incentives provided by government agencies to businesses. 
Currently, the company is focused on supplying its technology to three sectors, namely, construction, critical infrastructure as well as the plantation and agro-sectors. 
Post-Covid-19, Armi is confident that the company is set to quadruple its sales due to aggressive awareness promotions of technologies, additional upcoming new products and solutions and expansion to new markets.
The company plans to expand to new markets such as Indonesia, South Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
Meanwhile, Armi also commended Malaysia Digital Economy Corp’s support to local tech solution providers, as it enables Malaysian-made tech to stand tall among other developed countries. 
“Given the support from agencies, the government can do more to lead the adoption of locally developed Geo-AI platforms amongst various agencies.

228071,Lifestyle,5,07/12/2020,China tops world in AI patent filings,,"CHINA now leads the world in artificial intelligence patent applications, surpassing the United States for the first time, a development seen bolstering the country’s position as the second-largest market for AI amid Beijing’s tech and trade war with Washington.
The achievement was highlighted by Li Yuxiao, deputy head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies, at a press conference during the 7th World Internet Conference (WIC).
China filed more than 110,000 AI patent applications last year to move ahead of the US in the number of such filings worldwide, according to Li, whose agency is affiliated with industry regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China.
“China is strengthening its independence and technological capabilities in Internet information technology,” said Li, who did not specify the number of AI patents filed by the US in 2019.
The US and China are jostling to dominate advanced technologies, from 5G to quantum computing and AI. 
The sharp rise in China’s AI patent applications, funding and commercial deployment in surveillance activities prompted the US government to take action in October last year, when a number of the country’s AI tech champions were added to Washington’s trade blacklist. 
That has restricted their access to American hi-tech components like semiconductors and software.
China, which has laid out plans to become the global AI leader by 2030, is also being challenged by the technology’s unclear application scenarios, high investment, and security and ethical issues.
Both China and the US see the potential of AI technology in helping improve the efficiency of their respective economies, including in industries such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, health care and education.
Last year, surveillance was the biggest single end user of AI in China, accounting for 53.8% of all AI-powered applications, according to research firm iiMedia. Finance was second at 15.8%, followed by marketing at 11.6% and transport at 4.2%.
At WIC, two separate studies – the China Internet Development Report 2020 and World Internet Development Report 2020 – were released to show the country’s efforts in developing its digital economy, which includes relevant infrastructure like datacentres and 5G mobile networks to support growth amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Over the past year, China has continued to show the world its responsibility and contribution to the development of the Internet,” said Li.
The conference is also known as the Wuzhen Summit, after the northern town in Zhejiang province where it takes place.

According to IBM’s Institute of Business Value study “Covid-19 and the Future of Business”, 55% of C-suite executives say that the pandemic has resulted in permanent changes to organisational strategy and 60% of the responding organisations have accelerated their digital transformations due to Covid-19.  
Businesses have recognised that they must be built for continuity and resilience. 
The “next normal” environment has required the prioritisation and acceleration of digital transformation across products, services and business processes to meet the new digital demands from both employees and customers.
“Globally, companies have accelerated their digital transformation. 
“They do this by adopting artificial intelligence (AI), cloud-based remote collaboration tools and seeking data-driven insights to fast-tracking innovation and transforming business operations.
“Cloud and AI technology can help businesses to deliver better, scalable and secure digital services, enhance customer experience, and to become truly cognitive enterprises.
“We see an acceleration in the adoption of hybrid cloud as a result of the pandemic as companies turn to application modernisation, process automation and AI infusion of its business operations. 
“A hybrid cloud platform approach delivers 2.5 times more value than a traditional, public cloud only approach,” says IBM Malaysia managing director Catherine Lian.
In terms of customer experience, a recent call centre research revealed that 25% of respondents would pay more for a better experience regardless of product type while 62% would switch to a competitor product if they had a bad experience. 
The research also noted that 64% wanted real-time responses at any point in time.
Businesses can take full benefit of cloud and AI to enhance their customer experience and provide a real-time response. 
“IBM has made significant strides forward and partnered with innovative companies across industries to infuse cloud and AI in their contact centre and customer care centres. 
“This allows organisations to drastically reduce costs with the use of intelligent chatbots and virtual agents, for example. 
“Companies will be able to redeploy their resources or enhance their offerings to generate new revenue streams, with the shift of focus to sales from service,” says Devabalan Theyventheran, partner for Asean Financial Services Sector at IBM Global Business Services.
Devabalan was speaking at the #digitalXdata 2020 CxO Virtual Dialogue: Emerge as a Stronger Brand in the Next Normal. 
The roundtable session saw professionals from various industries sharing their challenges and lessons from the current crisis. 
When the pandemic first hit, IBM was also helping government agencies, healthcare organisations and academic institutions throughout the world use AI to put trusted data and information into the hands of the citizens. 
In Asean, IBM collaborated with United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network Youth Philippines to deliver fast and trusted Covid-19 information using IBM Watson Assistant, a conversational AI solution/virtual agent designed and trained to understand natural language and interact with users to provide responses to Covid-19 questions.
IBM Malaysia Global Technology Services general manager Joey Mak also notes that AI has become an important tool in helping organisations draw insights from data and in implementing data-driven solutions while ensuring that the data is protected. 
“As data becomes the top asset for businesses, data governance will ensure that data and information being handled is consistent, reliable and trustworthy.
“Establishing and deploying an analytics platform that embeds data governance and data integration, among other solutions, has never been more critical,” says Mak. 
Participants at the roundtable noted that companies that had gone digital early in the pandemic have performed well despite the challenging economic condition.
They also acknowledged that there was a need for a change in mindset to embrace emerging technology to stay competitive in the next normal.
“With the right technology solutions and best practices, businesses can ensure continuity of their business operations and engage their customers in new and innovative ways.

225837,Lifestyle,2,01/12/2020,AI helps budding poets with stanzas,,"HAVING a hard time with your rhymes? Fear not, artificial intelligence (AI) is on hand to help with writers’ block. 
Google recently launched a new tool called “Verse by Verse” to help budding poets create verses worthy of Emily Dickinson or Edgar Allan Poe.
The strict meters of formal verse can be enough to have any aspiring poet doubting their vocation. 
Now, Google is offering budding bards a helping hand with Verse by Verse, billed as an “AI-powered muse that helps you compose poetry inspired by classic American poets”. 
As a starting point, the tech giant is offering wannabe wordsmiths and poets a choice of three big names from American poetry – including Emma Lazarus, James Weldon Johnson and Lydia Huntley Sigourney. 
The artificial intelligence behind the tool then draws on 
the poets’ styles for inspiration when creating new verses. Users simply have to state their preferences as to the poetic form, syllable count and rhyme. Whether classic quatrains or couplets, or free verse full of blistering rhymes – you decide. 
Once the parameters are set, the AI works its magic. After penning a first verse, the AI will offer several proposed continuations of the poem. While Verse by Verse could draw on the transcendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson for your second verse, it may provide a final flourish with the musical verses of Georgia Douglas Johnson. 
“In this application, there are two models at work. One model, a generative model, was trained on classic poetry in order to learn how to create novel verses in the style of our cadre of poets. The other model, which uses the same semantic understanding technology as our other applications, was trained to semantically understand which verses best follow the previously written line of verse,” explains Google on its website. – AFP",hard time rhyme artificial intelligence hand writer google tool verse verse poet verse worthy dickinson edgar allan strict meter formal verse poet vocation google budding bard hand verse muse poetry inspired classic american poet tech giant offering wannabe wordsmith poet choice name american poetry emma lazarus james johnson lydia huntley sigourney artificial intelligence tool draw poet inspiration verse user preference poetic form syllable count rhyme classic quatrain couplet free verse rhyme decide parameter magic verse offer continuation verse verse draw transcendentalism waldo emerson verse final flourish musical verse douglas johnson application model generative model classic poetry learn create verse style poet semantic technology application understand verse verse google website afp,"[(5, 0.9921091)]",5
222147,Lifestyle,20,22/11/2020,Needs more AI animus,"New tech thriller Next is a little slow to take shape, leaving us guessing  as to the goals of its ‘villain’.","ARE artificially intelligent virtual assistant speakers – like Amazon’s Alexa, dig? – getting a bad reputation in TV-land? 
Last year on the excellent Evil, we had a couple of different instances where the little devices turned malevolent.
And now, on Next – the new 10-episode “event series” from 24 producer Manny Coto – we’ve seen an “Iliza” virtual assistant try to coax a bullied little boy into taking violent revenge on his tormentors.
I don’t know about you, but this stuff is enough to make me regard even my (aesthetically similar) electric mosquito trap with suspicion.
On Next, the “evil” force is not Evil as such, but a highly sophisticated, human-level artificial intelligence.
It is so sophisticated that even its creator, eccentric genius Paul LeBlanc (John Slattery, Mad Men and older Howard Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), pulled the plug on the project.
Why? Paul feared that its creation would lead to a technological singularity, that point at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and explosive, leading to upheavals in human civilisation.
But there’s no keeping a good sinister AI down and so, thanks to human greed in the form of Paul’s brother Ted (Jason Butler Harner), the project known as Next flourished, evolved, and then … went rogue.
Essentially, Next is the story of how Paul, FBI Special Agent Shea Salazar (Fernanda Andrade) and her team of cybercrime specialists try to track and neutralise the AI before it can do untold harm.
So clearly, Next is plonking its plot points down on the side of the debate which posits that any superintelligence worth its salt will inevitably destroy humanity.
It’s a concept way older than even Skynet (as a search for AI-themed films will reveal), but at least Coto and Co have taken the savvy route of not trying to depict Next on screen.
Heck, running lights on circuit boards, blinking status panels and creepy mag tape reel rotation are all so last century.
So on Next, it’s the stuff urban dwellers have come to regard as commonplace today that serves as the visual (and sometimes verbal) representation of its antagonist’s malice.
From those much-maligned virtual assistant speakers to our ever-dependable smartphones, from smart to not-so-smart vehicles, anything which is connected to the Internet is open to being taken over by Next – humanity’s vulnerability here is laid on thick and fast, like a constant validation of every technophobe’s paranoia.
Being early days yet for the show (this review is based on only the first three episodes), Next has not really established its personality or objectives yet.
In the meantime, viewers are left to watch Paul, Shea and their AI-busters reason out what their quarry is trying to achieve.
That would be fine by itself, but we are also made to cope with everything that is heaped on Paul’s shoulders. 
As (more or less) the central figure here, Slattery carries the weight of his character’s mission well enough – when he isn’t being worn down by some unnecessary woes the writers have piled 
on him in the name of “characterisation”. 
For one thing, this tech genius basically got kicked out of his advanced technology company for refusing to work on … advanced technology. 
Ooh, it’s almost like the time Tony Stark wanted his weapons company to stop making weapons. No wonder Slattery sometimes seems to be channelling his fast-talking MCU son.
Also: he’s estranged not only from his brother but also his own daughter. 
And, oh yes, Paul happens to be dying from a degenerative brain disease.
Someone really, really wanted us to feel bad for this guy; as if being the progenitor of an entity that could wipe out humanity was not enough of a burden. 
The end result, unfortunately, is a diffused character that does not quite anchor the show.
It’s a lot easier to get behind Shea’s struggles, not only with her job but her family as well; Next goes after both to derail her investigation into its machinations, you see. 
Next is much more watchable when it focuses on those aspects, and on the terrifying possibility that one’s entire existence can be hijacked by an unseen force (like one truly unfortunate soul in the third episode).
I’m not totally sold on the show but I will keep watching if only to see what Next is really getting up to. Personally, I figure a superintelligence worthy of the monicker will not extinguish humanity, but enslave and bend us to its will instead. 
That would put a totally different slant on the term “human resource”, with the new overlord certainly being smart enough – smarter than a good number of people – to recognise and fully exploit the worth of humanity (even if we’re just meant to be its batteries, at least we’ll still be plugged in to something).

214297,StarEdu,3,01/11/2020,AI and data to enhance curriculum,,"THE Education Ministry is training students to have skills relevant to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0).
This is being done via this the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) “Informatics and Data Science Education Reform for Digital, Inclusive and Sustainable Society” project, said the ministry’s Curriculum Development Division deputy director (technology) Sofian Azmi Tajul Arus.
The project, which has already begun, aims to develop primary and secondary school curriculum based on artificial intelligence (AI) and data.
In line with this project, the division believes that IR4.0 thinking skills – namely computational thinking, coding, data science, machine learning and statistical thinking – should be mastered by students.
“Computational thinking is the process of thinking logically and systematically in problem solving while using the basic principles of computer science through programming and algorithmic skills.
“It involves techniques such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and generalisation,” said Sofian Azmi.
Decomposition, he explained, involves breaking up complex problems into smaller, more controlled and easily understood parts of the issue to be analysed and resolved; while pattern recognition involves analysing and observing the issue based on trends, and information.
“Abstraction involves summarising common features and determining important aspects of a problem and generalisation is the process of determining the similarities in a problem to produce a formula, algorithm or model,” he added.
Stressing that the ministry is committed to preparing students for the future, he said it has launched the National Policy on Industry 4.0 and has adopted equitable and inclusive use of AI in education to support Unesco’s sustainable development goals (SDG).
This, he said, includes integrating AI skills in the school curriculum.
“The National Education Committee suggested that the ministry include an AI module into the curriculum.
“We value input from relevant parties as it enables us to enhance the curriculum to make it more relevant to the times,” he said, adding that the ministry had through a revised Primary School Standard-based Curriculum (KSSR) and Secondary School Standard-based Curriculum (KSSM), rolled out IR4.0 related education including robotics and coding, basic computer science, computer science and innovation.
“However, we (ministry) are still facing challenges. There is a lot of upskilling among teachers that needs to be done.
“There is also a lack of infrastructure, facilities and gadgets,” he said during a YouTube interview on Oct 19.

212459,Main,12,26/10/2020,Use of AI in healthcare can solve the inequality of access,,"MY 85-year-old uncle was hospitalised due to ageing issues at a private hospital in Kolkata, India. In the intensive care unit, he contracted Covid-19 from another patient whose infection the hospital was not even aware of. It took the hospital days to figure out that many of its ICU patients, doctors and other professionals were already infected.
The pandemic shows us the inequality of healthcare access. This collective global experience will invariably lead to demands of massive upscaling of healthcare. Economic and political inaction under such demand is not an option.
So far, experts have hesitated to implement the broad introduction of healthcare AI (artificial intelligence). However, if the choice is between AI and no diagnosis at all, choosing the former can give the deprived a fairer chance.
The explosion of digitised medical data demands a fundamental change in mindset of how technology should be used in clinical workflow. Training already available healthcare workers in rural areas how to use a new smartphone app is much easier. We already witnessed such a technology transition when photography moved from physical film to digital. Platforms such as Flickr and programmes like Photoshop have changed the entire landscape of how photos are processed, handled and consumed globally.
While measuring the economic impact of healthcare AI, it is not enough to just think in terms of how much AI saves for a particular diagnosis compared with the currently available method. This approach only measures profit. The alternative here is massive, long-term investment in traditional healthcare during a global economic slowdown. The explosion of digitised medical data cannot be matched by increasing the number of high-quality healthcare professionals.
The cost of diagnostic delay during a pandemic is substantial at sociopolitical and economic levels. A global acceleration towards AI-ready healthcare is of paramount importance.
There are, of course, legitimate concerns about data security, privacy and unprecedented surveillance. Nobody is suggesting this will be easy. But shouldering this responsibility is the price we pay for living in democracies.
When it comes to something as basic a need as access to primary healthcare, it is not an option for the haves to decide detrimentally for the have-nots.

210627,StarBiz,3,22/10/2020,Giant hyperscale  data centre in AI park,G3 Global to take the lead in the project,"PETALING JAYA: G3 Global Bhd plans to house the country’s largest hyperscale data centre in the proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) park in Bukit Jalil, starting with three 10MW hyperscale data centres in the first phase of development.
At maturity, the data centres will have a potential end state of 100MW. 
G3 Global executive director Dr James Tee said G3 Global has the opportunity to take a leading role in the hyperscale data centre space through the group’s association with Green Packet Bhd, It will support the initial demand by Tencent Cloud’s operations in Malaysia as part of its global node, as well as meet demand from other large scale anchor cloud operators.
In August, Green Packet inked a 10-year agreement with Tencent Cloud to provide cloud computing solutions in Malaysia.
“The hyperscale data centre will be scaled according to demand progressively.
“G3 Global is in discussions with domestic and regional hyperscale data centre partners on potential collaborations.
“We are also open to collaborating with strategic partners who bring demand from their extensive network and user base,” he told StarBiz.A hyperscale data centre caters to between one and three clients who require higher technology specifications and greater data capacity for their operations.
In comparison, a standard data centre serves some 50 to 100 enterprises.
At present, Singapore is the data centre hub for the South-East Asian region, providing 64% of total supply with a capacity of 410MW in 2019.
Tee noted that Singapore’s data centre capacity is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 542MW in 2024, according to research firm Analysys Mason.
However, further supply will be hampered by shortage of land and power, as well as cost concerns.
“Hence, Malaysia is well positioned to capture the spillover demand from Singapore, given the close proximity, greater availability of land and power, as well as low connectivity cost.
“This is potentially similar to Langfang and Zhangjiakou, which are key data centre hubs in Greater Beijing, due to land scarcity and power constraints in Beijing itself,” he said.
On the domestic front, demand for digital services is expected to be driven by a strong government push for digitalisation and cloud adoption, as well as a shift towards greater digital consumption by enterprises and consumers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Bank Negara’s new policy on risk management in technology would drive demand for outsourced data centre co-location and cloud services for financial institutions, as on-premise servers will not meet the new requirements, Tee said.
According to MDEC, co-location data centre capacity is expected to grow by 12% CAGR from 59MW to 104MW between 2019 and 2024.
At present, cloud and Internet giants lease more than 70% of their hyperscale data centre footprint from commercial data centre operators.
“Some of the very powerful value drivers that companies should look to exploit from hyperscale cloud platforms are cost, scalability and interoperability. The hyperscale platforms provide the ability to handle immense volumes of activity and data, quickly and seamlessly.
“In addition, the hyperscale provider’s cloud platform allows customers to extend and build out their capabilities, as well as offers integration with other systems at a lower cost,” said Tee.
The hyperscale data centres will also support the deployment of autonomous cars, which generate between 380 Terabyte (TB) to 5100TB of sensor data per car annually.
The AI park, which will house AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote AI technology in Malaysia, will also feature autonomous cars, among other AI technology such as licence plate and facial recognition.
According to a Bursa Malaysia filing on Oct 9, G3 Global received a letter of intent from Technology Park Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd for the building of the AI park at Technology Park Malaysia.

210783,Main,21,22/10/2020,AI model detects Covid-19 and other diseases,,"BEIJING: Chinese researchers published a paper in the journal Nature Communications this month proposing an artificial intelligence model that can help doctors quickly differentiate between Covid-19, influenza and pneumonia with high accuracy.
Since the Covid-19 outbreak, numerous AI systems have been developed and used for front-line detection and diagnosis, such as analysing chest X-rays and CT scans. 
However, with flu season approaching, if Covid-19 and influenza were to break out together, causing the CT diagnosis workload to skyrocket, differentiating between the two respiratory illnesses would prove challenging for doctors.
A new AI model may provide the answer. Researchers from Tsinghua University and Union Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, have developed and evaluated an AI system using a large data set with more than 11,000 CT volumes from cases of Covid-19, influenza, non-viral community-acquired pneumonia, and non-pneumonia.
The AI model, known as a deep convolutional neural network-based system, turned detection experiences accumulated by experts into algorithms. Test results showed it can differentiate between four respiratory diseases, including Covid-19, influenza and non-pneumonia, with a high degree of accuracy.
The AI model will help lessen the workload of doctors. The study showed that the average reading time for radiologists was six and a half minutes, while that of the AI system was 2.73 seconds.
The paper said the AI system was only slightly worse at distinguishing pneumonia from nonpneumonia than radiologists. – Xinhua",chinese researcher paper journal nature communication month artificial intelligence model doctor covid influenza pneumonia accuracy covid numerous system front detection diagnosis chest ray scan season covid influenza break diagnosis workload skyrocket respiratory illness doctor model provide answer researcher university union hospital hubei province system data volume influenza viral community pneumonia pneumonia model deep convolutional neural network system detection experience expert algorithm test differentiate respiratory disease covid influenza pneumonia degree accuracy model lessen workload doctor average reading time half minute system paper system pneumonia nonpneumonia radiologist,"[(5, 0.9898789)]",5

208721,StarBiz 7,3,17/10/2020,AI park will help Malaysia take the lead in digital future,,"MALAYSIA’s development of an artificial intelligence (AI) park will be vital to cement its position as the leading South-East Asian nation in the field of AI as the country takes a step forward.
AI technology is expected to contribute some US$115bil (RM476.84bil) to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2030, according to a report by consultancy firm Kearney.
Neighbouring countries such as Indonesia are expected to see an inflow of US$366bil (RM1.52 trillion) while Thailand and Singapore could see AI bringing in US$117bil (RM485.43bil) and US$110bil (RM456.39bil) to their respective GDPs.
Financial services and retail have been early adopters of AI in Indonesia. 
On a whole, there is a lot of potential in the logistics and supply chain sector.  AI usage in South-East Asia is mainly for marketing and sales, followed by supply chain and manufacturing.
“The world today revolves around a rapid pace of technology convergence that enables efficiency, elimination of wastage and gains in productivity.
“AI has indeed delivered new ways of working and for AI players like us, both from the technology and smart city fields, to really build sustainable cities and assist in maintaining infrastructure and in improving public services.
“It all starts with the ability to gather data from trillions of sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices and extract actionable insights,” Dr James Tee tells StarBizWeek. He is the new executive director of G3 Global Bhd, an associate company of Green Packet Bhd. 
Key among G3’s initiatives would be the realisation of an AI park to position Malaysia as the AI and digital hub for Asean.
The company inked an agreement last year with Chinese partners SenseTime Group Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd (CHEC) on the setting up of Malaysia’s first AI park, with a total investment of more than US$1bil (RM4.15bil) over the next five years.
Tee is of the view that the AI park will place Malaysian on the forefront of AI research and commercialisation of innovation, which will stimulate a new generation of high-tech businesses and jobs in Malaysia.
He adds that the beauty of Malaysia’s AI park is that it is a private sector-driven investment and not with the public sector at the forefront. It is also of utmost importance now because the public sector is not in a very good position to be able to spend and pump prime the economy.
“G3, together with our technological partners from abroad, are going to bring in investments from domestic and foreign sources. 
“If you look at the demand side of the economy, where is that growth going to come from?
“Private consumption, which is around 60% of our GDP, is going to grow at a tepid pace because people are uncertain and they don’t spend as much,” he says, adding that exports are needed to lead the charge.
In order for exports to continue growing, Tee says, investments need to come in at the upstream and the AI park is one of the projects that will drive this upstream investment.
All they hope for is that government facilitates in terms of providing relevant incentives to attract global companies to the AI park and bring in foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.
With Budget 2021 due next month and the 12th Malaysia Plan early next year, Tee hopes the government prioritises policies that will encourage private investments and FDIs into the technology sector. 
“In association with Green Packet, what we’re bringing into the picture are fintech (financial technology) and proptech (property technology) solutions to create a truly touchless economy and touchless operation to fully transform us into an intelligent city.
“Our vision is for the AI Park to be Malaysia’s very first AI-powered Technopolis, with schools, residences, factories, and transportation and infrastructure facilities equipped with the latest AI solutions.
“This will be important for the nation as it will house the necessary AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote the technology within our country,” says Tee, adding that a data centre will be one of the key components in the AI park, which will facilitate cloud computing and the digitisation of enterprises.
He also points out that South Asia lags two to three years behind the US and China in terms of AI adoption, according to Kearney and Singapore-based investment firm EDBI.
A survey conducted has shown that the AI adoption rate stands at 14% across South-East Asia, an improvement from 8% last year.
Malaysia’s AI adoption rate of 8.1% also lags significantly behind Indonesia at 24.6% and Thailand at 17.1%.
One of the main issues is that many Malaysian organisations are concerned over the cost of solutions and doubt the quality of the model.
Despite that, Tee believes opportunities are abundant to harness the potential of AI technology to improve productivity and generate revenue.  He stresses that Malaysia has to do more in terms of educating enterprises.
“Manufacturing, especially electrical and electronics (E&E) manufacturing, will be an important part of the Malaysian growth as other sectors on the supply side will not be able to support the country’s economic growth in the years to come.
“This is where AI comes in, because it is plugged into the supply chain of the E&E sector. And it is not just the semiconductor that will benefit. Those in integrated circuit design, those who do tests, measurements and packaging are all going to fit in that growth. 
“The growth in AI will support E&E manufacturing and that gives our economy a very strong boost, especially when our services and mining sectors are coming under tremendous pressure,” he says.",malaysia development artificial intelligence park vital cement position south east asian nation field country step technology contribute bil bil malaysia gross domestic product gdp report consultancy firm country inflow bil thailand singapore bil bil bil bil respective gdp financial service retail adopter indonesia lot potential logistics supply chain sector usage south east asia marketing sale supply chain revolves rapid pace technology convergence enables elimination wastage gain productivity player technology smart city field sustainable city infrastructure public service ability gather data trillion sensor iot device actionable insight james tell starbizweek executive director global bhd associate company green packet bhd key initiative realisation park position malaysia digital hub asean company agreement chinese partner sensetime china harbour engineering chec malaysia park total investment bil bil tee view park malaysian forefront commercialisation innovation stimulate generation tech business job beauty malaysia park private sector driven investment public sector utmost public sector position pump prime economy technological partner investment domestic foreign source economy growth private consumption gdp grow tepid pace people uncertain export lead charge export tee investment upstream park project upstream investment hope government facilitates term relevant incentive global company park foreign direct investment fdi country budget month malaysia plan government prioritises policy private investment technology sector association green packet picture fintech financial technology proptech property technology solution touchless economy touchless operation intelligent city vision park malaysia technopolis school factory transportation infrastructure facility solution nation house public service infrastructure base promote technology country tee data centre key component park facilitate cloud digitisation enterprise asia lag china term adoption kearney singapore investment firm survey adoption rate south east asia improvement malaysia adoption rate lag thailand main issue malaysian organisation concerned cost solution quality model tee opportunity abundant harness potential technology productivity generate revenue malaysia term enterprise electrical electronics malaysian growth sector support country economic growth supply chain sector semiconductor benefit circuit design measurement fit growth growth support economy strong boost service mining sector tremendous pressure,"[(2, 0.033232234), (3, 0.9643011)]",3

“The AI park is a very important project that can bring Malaysia to the next level and it will certainly be a national agenda for the government to create a high-tech industry and create high value jobs for the country,” James Tee told StarBiz. 
Tee was recently appointed as an executive director of G3 Global Bhd, an associate company of Green Packet Bhd. 
Among G3’s strategic initiatives would be the realisation of an AI park to position Malaysia as the AI and digital hub for Asean. 
Tee was certain that AI would be in the mainstream in the years to come and when that happens, coupled with the convergence of technology including blockchain, big data and other technology, it will boost the semiconductor industry growth and ultimately, drive growth in the E&E sector. 
“Malaysia is in a very strong position because we are traditionally very strong in semiconductor and manufacturing so we want to ride on the existing strength of Malaysia to continue to lead South-East Asia in terms of AI technology and its deployment. 
“We believe this is a very important step for Malaysia to step out and step up for us to take a leap through our AI park and AI city development,” Tee said. 
With the constant adaptation and adoption of the most advanced technology in the city development, Tee said much focus would be placed on research and development, commercialisation and innovation of new technology that can help to serve the people better, increase productivity and the growth of the country. 
He added that they were quite clear that E&E manufacturing would be a very important part of the Malaysian growth moving forward because sectors on the supply side would not be able to support the country’s growth in the years to come.
“This is where AI comes in, because it is plugged into the supply chain of the E&E sector. 
“And it is not just the semiconductor that will benefit. 
“Those in integrated circuit design, those who do test, measurement and packaging are all going to fit into that growth.
“The growth in AI will support E&E manufacturing and that gives our economy a very strong boost, especially when our services and mining sectors are coming under tremendous pressure,” he said.
Besides, he added, the mainstay of Malaysia from the supply side has always been manufacturing of goods, which has been keeping the country’s current account in surplus.",jaya electrical electronics industry main contributor gross domestic product gdp driven growth artificial intelligence malaysian manufacturing sector contribution sector bulk semiconductor park project tremendous growth semiconductor industry deployment usage technology semiconductor brain technology park project malaysia level national agenda government create tech industry create job country starbiz tee executive director global bhd associate company green packet bhd strategic initiative realisation park position malaysia digital hub asean tee mainstream convergence technology blockchain data technology boost semiconductor industry growth drive growth sector malaysia strong position strong semiconductor manufacturing ride strength malaysia lead south east asia term technology deployment step malaysia step step park city development tee constant adaptation adoption technology city development tee focus development commercialisation innovation technology people productivity growth country malaysian growth sector support country growth supply chain sector semiconductor benefit circuit design test measurement packaging fit growth growth support economy strong boost service mining sector tremendous pressure mainstay malaysia supply country current account surplus,"[(3, 0.9941049)]",3

G3 said Tee was appointed to drive the company’s strategic thrusts in the space of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).
Tee is a senior executive with more than 20 years of extensive expertise in strategic planning, value engineering, best practice execution and continuous business improvement across multiple fields such as smart city development, investment, asset management, insurance and strategic management consulting.
“He was previously CEO of several public-listed and non-listed companies, including Medini Iskandar Malaysia, as well as a management consultant with McKinsey & Co,” said G3 in a statement.
Key among G3’s strategic initiatives would be the realisation of an AI park to position Malaysia as the AI and digital hub for Asean, said the company.
“Conceptually designed to agglomerate AI-driven and cloud-powered technologies to accelerate the development of next-generation products and services such as smart city, mobility, retail, education and healthcare as well as robotics, fintech and blockchain, the AI park is expected to be the first for Malaysia and Asean.”
Tee said he is “exhilarated” to have the opportunity to strategise and orchestrate the delivery of Malaysia’s and Asean’s first AI park.
“The convergence of digital technologies at incredible speed is going to transform the way we live, work and play.
“In collaboration with leading global players from around the world, we will lay the foundation for Malaysia to take the quantum leap in AI and IoT that will spur tremendous growth and investment, especially in electrical and electronics and technology manufacturing and services,” said Tee.

206339,StarBiz 7,3,10/10/2020,AI park and Perak e-wallet boost for Green Packet,Firm set to register an earnings turnaround by FY21,"AFTER a recent lull in headline-grabbing news, Green Packet Bhd seems to be making its way into the news again. 
Yesterday, its associate company G3 Global Bhd said in a Bursa Malaysia filing that it had received a letter of intent (LoI) from Technology Park Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd (TPM) regarding the building of the ambitious artificial intelligence (AI) park located at Technology Park Malaysia in Bukit Jalil. 
On the same day, Green Packet also announced that it has made some inroads into powering the use of digital payments in the state of Perak as part of a deal with the state government. 
This comes after CGS-CIMB had on Tuesday issued a non-rated research report on Green Packet, highlighting in particular, the earnings potential that the technology company could gain from its venture with Tencent Cloud to build the cloud business for the Malaysian market. 
G3 has already teamed up with China’s top AI firm, SenseTime, along with China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd to jointly develop the AI park.
In addition, G3 continues to be in talks with big-name technology providers to be anchor investors in the AI park.
Further details on the development have yet to be ironed out, but it was previously reported that the AI park is expected to have a gross development value of “above tens of billions.”
The AI park is envisioned to be Malaysia’s very first AI-powered technopolis, with schools, residences, factories, and transportation and infrastructure facilities equipped with the latest AI solutions.
It also has been reported that the AI park is vital as it would house the necessary AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote AI technology in Malaysia. 
The AI park would also be a place for talent to be trained on AI and machine learning and will serve as a platform for the development of AI solutions such as speech recognition, robotics and smart city technology. It is also planned to be a regional epicentre for data management and commercial ecosystem.
 In the LoI, TPM expressed its intent to further discuss G3’s request for proposal submissions and the proposed development project of the AI park.
While the LoI indicates some progress on the development project, there needs to be a letter of award to follow, which will then provide more clarity on the terms of the deal. 
 Meanwhile, Green Packet’s wholly owned subsidiary kiplePay is collaborating with Digital Perak Corp Holdings to provide a unified payment platform for cashless transactions in government services and businesses in Perak.
With this cashless payment platform, citizens can pay for services through the Digital Perak web portal, which include training courses, co-working space, computer labs and office through Hub Innovasi and Multimedia (HiM), as well as asset booking, quit rent and summon payment with municipal councils in Perak.
Apart from that, merchants under Digital Perak’s S.M.A.R.T Niaga @ Perak programme will be able to use kiplePay’s merchant app that supports cashless payments for in-store transactions, while the kipleBiz Unified Payment platform will support merchants who sell their services or goods online with payment gateway services that facilitates multiple payment modes such as online banking, debit or credit card and multiple ewallets.
According to CGS-CIMB, kiplePay is pursuing further opportunities in the education sector, on the back of its position as the leading e-wallet in the local public higher education sector.
As of August 2020, kiplePay commanded a 60% share of an estimated market size of RM5.8bil in potential spending per annum.
The research house notes that kiplePay is exploring opportunities with Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and the National Higher Education Fund Corp (PTPTN).
Despite Green Packet’s digital services segment posting a net loss of RM13mil for the first half of the financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) due to business development costs, kiplePay’s gross transaction during the period grew 113% year-on-year.
With kiplePay’s prospects in the pipeline, coupled with Green Packet’s 10-year exclusive agreement signed with Tencent Cloud and the winding up of loss-making Singapore mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Vivohub, CGS-CIMB notes that these are signs of green shoots for Green Packet.
The Tencent Cloud agreement will see Green Packet initially invest RM100mil for 600 servers that will go live by the first quarter of 2021.
“Green Packet believes this will grow to 3,000 to 4,000 servers over the next four to five years with a total investment of RM300mil to RM500mil. 
“Green Packet projects the business to contribute 30% to 40% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) in FY22, with a net present value (NPV) of US$82mil (RM339mil) over 10 years.
“Green Packet posted a core net loss of RM65mil and RM37mil in FY19 and the first half of FY20 due to continued investments to expand its digital service business,” says CGS-CIMB, adding that Green Packet is optimistic of an earnings turnaround by FY21.
The earnings turnaround is also partly due to the winding up of Vivohub and full settlement of exchangeable medium-term notes (EMTNs) issued to TM previously.
Excluding Vivohub’s earnings, CGS-CIMB says Green Packet’s communications business segment would have turned in a net profit of RM2mil in FY19 and RM3mil in the first half of FY20.
As for the full settlement of EMTNs, it is estimated that Green Packet will save some RM20mil in interest cost per annum, turning its net debt of RM252mil during the second quarter of FY20 into proforma net cash of RM31mil.
Just last month, Green Packet divested its 10.3% fully-diluted stake in webe to TM for full settlement of RM283mil in EMTNs. 
Despite all the positive news flows surrounding Green Packet, its share price has been flat of late.
Following the spike it enjoyed in May 2020 at a high of RM1.44, Green Packet’s share price has since declined, ending Friday at 50 sen, with a market capitalisation of RM549mil. 
However, it should be noted that Green Packet owns just under 30% of G3 and more than 50% of the latter’s outstanding warrants, the total value of which comes up to some RM730mil.
It should be noted that Green Packet is in the midst of a placement exercise. The group plans to raise another RM63mil to RM99mil via a second tranche of private placement of 120 million to 190 million shares at a 52 sen apiece to fund working capital and cloud infrastructure investment.",lull headline news green packet bhd news yesterday company global bhd bursa malaysia received letter intent loi technology park malaysia corp sdn bhd tpm ambitious artificial intelligence park technology park malaysia bukit jalil day green packet inroad digital payment perak deal government cgs cimb tuesday report green packet earnings potential technology company venture tencent cloud build cloud business malaysian market china top firm china harbour engineering company park addition talk technology provider investor park detail development park gross development ten billion park malaysia technopolis school factory transportation infrastructure facility solution park vital house public service infrastructure base promote technology malaysia park talent machine platform development solution recognition robotics smart city technology regional epicentre data management commercial ecosystem loi tpm intent request proposal submission development project park loi progress development project letter follow clarity term green packet subsidiary kiplepay digital perak corp holding unified payment platform cashless transaction government service business cashless payment platform pay service digital perak web portal training course space computer lab office hub multimedia asset quit rent summon payment municipal council perak merchant digital perak niaga perak programme kiplepay merchant app cashless payment transaction unified payment platform support merchant service online payment gateway service multiple payment mode debit credit card multiple ewallets cimb kiplepay opportunity education sector position wallet local public education sector august kiplepay share market size potential spending annum house note opportunity bank islam malaysia national education fund corp ptptn green packet digital service segment net loss mil half financial dec business development cost gross transaction period kiplepay prospect pipeline green packet exclusive agreement tencent cloud loss singapore mobile virtual network operator mvno vivohub cgs cimb note sign green shoot green packet tencent cloud agreement green packet invest mil server quarter green packet grow server total investment mil mil green packet project business earnings tax depreciation amortisation net npv mil mil green packet core net loss mil mil half investment digital service business cgs cimb green packet optimistic earnings turnaround earnings turnaround vivohub settlement exchangeable medium term note vivohub earnings cgs cimb green packet communication business segment net profit mil mil half settlement emtns green packet mil cost annum net debt mil quarter proforma net cash mil month green packet diluted stake webe settlement mil positive news green packet share price flat late spike green packet share price friday sen market capitalisation mil green packet outstanding warrant total mil green packet midst placement exercise plan mil mil tranche private placement share fund capital cloud infrastructure investment,"[(2, 0.9976199)]",2
203617,Lifestyle,6,05/10/2020,Can AI encourage good behaviour online?,,"HOSTILE and hateful remarks are thick on the ground on social networks in spite of persistent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube to tone them down. 
Now researchers at the OpenWeb platform have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to moderate Internet users’ comments before they are even posted. 
The method appears to be effective because one third of users modified the text of their comments when they received a nudge from the new system, which warned that what they had written might be perceived as offensive.
The study conducted by OpenWeb and Perspective API analysed 400,000 comments that some 50,000 users were preparing to post on sites like AOL, Salon, Newsweek, RT and Sky Sports.
Some of these users received a feedback message or nudge from a machine learning algorithm to the effect that the text they were preparing to post might be insulting, or against the rules of the forum they were using. 
Instead of rejecting comments it found to be suspect, the moderation algorithm then invited their authors to reformulate what they had written.
“Let’s keep the conversation civil. Please remove any inappropriate language from your comment,” was a message prompt or “Some members of the community may find your comment offensive. Try again?”
In response to this kind of feedback, a third of Internet users (34%) immediately modified their comments, while 36% went ahead and posted their comments anyway, taking the risk that they might be rejected by the moderating algorithm. 
Even more surprisingly, some users made modifications that did not necessarily make their comments kinder or less hostile.
While close to 30% of users opted to accept the feedback message and delete potentially offensive text from their comments, more than a quarter (25.8%) attempted to dupe the moderating algorithm.
Deliberate spelling errors and adding spaces between letters were just two of the tricks they used to modify the form of their comments while leaving their content unchanged.
The 400,000 comments analysed in the study are, however, a mere drop in the ocean when compared to the millions that are posted daily on the Internet, some of which carry offensive and insulting language. 
Faced with this situation, tech giants are boosting their efforts to combat online hate more effectively.

190435,Lifestyle,4,07/09/2020,AI aces aerial combat,"In the dogfights of the future, is artificial intelligence the new top gun?","WHEN the final dogfight was over, there was no argument who won.
The competition pitted a newcomer against one of the US Air Force’s top pilots in a simulated battle for air superiority in the AlphaDogfight Trials in the United States.
After making it through the three rounds of qualifiers, the contender took on and convincingly rounded the veteran.
But there was no slap on the back for the victor – the winner was an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.
In a 5-0 sweep, the AI “pilot” created by the Maryland-based defence contractor Heron Systems beat “Banger”, a National Guard pilot and recent Air Force Weapons School Instructor Course graduate with over 2,000 hours of experience flying F-16s, according to Air Force Magazine.
But does this make AI a better pilot? Not so fast, say military analysts.
The AlphaDogfight Trials are designed to “demonstrate the feasibility of developing effective, intelligent autonomous agents capable of defeating adversary aircraft in a dogfight”, according to a key sponsor, the Advanced Research Project Agency (Darpa).
Darpa is an agency of the US Department of Defence responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.
The competition included multiple contractors and pitted their AI contenders against each other in a Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons simulation for the right to compete against Banger, according to various reports.
Despite the human pilots losing, military analysts in the US and China said the result did not mean that AI could defeat or even replace a human in real-life combat.
Hong Kong-based military commentator Song Zhongping said AI technology had been used in many countries for virtual reality (VR) training, but such technology was still unable to deal with unpredictable battle scenarios.
“Existing AI technology is still far away from real combat applications because its reaction is merely based on using big data technology and Cloud computing to simulate scenarios through algorithm optimisation,” Song, now a commentator on Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television, said.
“For example, would the AI pilot still win if it was not an F-16 but a stealth fighter jet like the F-22 or F-35 taking part in the AlphaDogfight Trials contest? I don’t think so.”
Song said many experiments had proven that AI failed to make unique observe-orient-decide-act (OODA) decisions, an important step in dogfight strategy that was developed by John Boyd, an influential American military strategist and a former pilot.
Commenting on the competition, Vincent “Jello” Aiello, a former US Navy pilot, told Forbes magazine that humans “excel in one important area when facing off against AI”.
“(Human pilots) know how to handle the type of uncertainty found in today’s combat engagements,” the magazine quoted him as saying. “Combat does not occur in sterile, static environments. It occurs in 3D, in real-time, where weather, your adversary, and a whole host of other factors come into play.”
Zhou Chenming, a researcher from the Yuan Wang, a Beijing-based military science and technology institute, agreed.
“Actual air combat is unpredictable and there are not any rules in a dogfight ... only human beings have the basic instinct to react with an innovative and diverse response.
“It’s still a long way, maybe dozens of years, before AI technology can be applied to real combat battlefields.”
But AI technology could make decisions in microseconds, far faster than its human counterpart, a fact that may have contributed to the victory in the competition, Zhou said.
The US Air Force said it started testing the use of AI and VR last year to help its pilots learn faster and improve retention.
A Beijing-based military insider said that in 2017 VR technology became a wider trend in China’s People’s Liberation Army pilot cadet training. VR helps the military increase accuracy and rigour and reduce training costs.
In 2014, Chinese pilot cadets were photographed by the PLA Air Force wearing VR headsets and using civilian Saitek X52 video game joysticks in simulated flying exercises. – South China Morning Post",final dogfight argument competition newcomer air force top pilot battle air superiority alphadogfight trial round qualifier veteran slap victor winner artificial intelligence algorithm sweep pilot maryland defence contractor heron system banger national guard pilot air force weapon school instructor graduate hour experience air force magazine pilot fast military analyst trial demonstrate feasibility effective intelligent autonomous agent capable adversary aircraft dogfight key sponsor project agency darpa agency department defence responsible development technology military competition multiple contractor contender martin falcon simulation banger report human pilot military analyst result defeat human real life combat hong kong military commentator song technology country virtual reality technology unable deal unpredictable battle scenario technology real combat application data technology cloud simulate scenario algorithm optimisation song commentator hong kong phoenix television pilot stealth fighter jet trial contest song experiment unique observe orient decide decision dogfight strategy john boyd influential american military strategist pilot competition vincent jello navy pilot forbes magazine human human pilot type uncertainty combat engagement magazine combat occur sterile static environment real time weather adversary host factor researcher yuan wang military science technology institute actual air combat unpredictable rule human basic instinct react innovative diverse response dozen technology real combat battlefield technology decision human counterpart victory competition zhou air force pilot faster retention beijing military insider technology trend china people pilot cadet training military increase accuracy rigour training cost chinese pilot cadet air force headset civilian saitek video game joystick exercise south china morning post,"[(1, 0.58110726), (2, 0.41577312)]",1
188995,Main,20,02/09/2020,Researchers: AI set to detect heart disease via selfies,,"BEIJING: Chinese medicine experts have been cooperating with computer scientists to create AI-powered technologies that can detect coronary artery disease through facial images.
In recent years, applications driven by artificial intelligence have been used in daily clinical practice like interpreting medical images, analysing electrocardiograms and tracking vital signs.
In the latest study, Chinese researchers explored the possibility of using AI to screen coronary artery disease via facial images.
Facial appearance has long been identified as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. 
Features such as male pattern baldness, earlobe creases, xanthelasmata (yellowish deposit of fat around or on the eyelids) and skin wrinkling are the most common predictors.
Researchers from the National Centre for Cardiovascular Diseases and Tsinghua University first enrolled 5,796 Chinese patients for the study. 
An AI algorithm was then tested on facial images of 1,013 other patients across nine hospitals.
According to the results published in the European Heart Journal, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 54%, outperforming the usual prediction model of coronary artery disease.
Sensitivity refers to an algorithm’s ability to designate a patient with a disease as positive, while specificity is the test’s ability to designate a patient without disease as negative.
The researchers said further studies are needed to make a practical application, as the current low specificity of the algorithm raises a concern of false-positives.
Overall, the results suggested that a deep learning algorithm can assist coronary artery disease detection, holding promise for pre-test screening of the disease in communities. — Xinhua",chinese medicine expert computer scientist technology coronary artery disease facial image application artificial intelligence clinical practice medical image electrocardiogram vital sign chinese researcher possibility screen coronary artery disease facial facial appearance indicator cardiovascular risk feature male pattern baldness earlobe xanthelasmata yellowish deposit fat eyelid skin common predictor researcher national centre cardiovascular disease university chinese patient algorithm facial image patient hospital european heart journal algorithm sensitivity specificity usual prediction model coronary artery disease sensitivity refers ability designate patient disease positive specificity test ability patient disease negative researcher study practical application current low specificity algorithm concern false positive deep learning algorithm assist coronary artery disease detection promise pre test disease community,"[(1, 0.19953185), (4, 0.7937634)]",4
185493,Lifestyle,4,24/08/2020,Harnessing AI as a firefighting tool,Researchers have developed artificial intelligence models that will eventually be able to predict wildfires and megafires.,"IN the collective imagination, global warming is responsible for the increasing power and frequency of forest fires. However, this is only partially true. 
As paradoxical as it may seem, some researchers suggest that the growing strength of fires is also due to the efficient work of fire services. By systematically extinguishing burning vegetation, firefighters would have inadvertently created the conditions for more and more fires.
This observation is based on the recent discovery of the essential role played by wildfire in the periodic regeneration of forests: the theory is that the oldest woods will naturally catch fire from the sun’s heat to make way for fresh growth.
Rise of megafires
This cycle is now being amplified by climate imbalances, which have disrupted the frequency of fires. As a result, forest fires are increasingly powerful and difficult to control to the point where we have now entered an era of megafires like those that have been observed in Australia, the Amazon, and more recently in Siberia.
Footage of millions of acres of burnt vegetation and hundreds of thousands of dead animals have raised awareness of the environmental and safety risks posed by such huge blazes.
In this context, prevention is the best remedy. Scientists and firefighters working together to develop new tools that can take into account the complexity of how fires emerge and spread have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to provide solutions.
Controlled burn
The main advantage of AI is its capacity to rapidly perform highly complex calculations that humans would take several days to resolve. 
For these calculations to be accurate, researchers have to feed massive amounts of information on past fires, associated meteorological conditions and vegetation into a computer. 
The goal is to enable the machine to mathematically link all of the data in a model that scientists can then use to predict future wildfire outbreaks.
The archiving work necessary for projects of this kind can take months, and even years, to optimise the AI agent’s understanding of the environment that it is supposed to supervise.
Several research groups are already experimenting with these futuristic firefighting tools, among them teams at the WiFire Lab in California, United States and the University of Alberta in Canada. 
Thanks to predictions provided by these AI agents, among other things, firefighters will soon be able to take advantage of recommendations for prescribed burns to save certain parts of the forest while allowing the natural process of forest regeneration to take its course. – AFP Relaxnews",collective imagination global warming responsible power frequency forest fire true paradoxical researcher strength fire efficient fire service vegetation firefighter condition fire discovery essential role wildfire periodic regeneration forest wood fire sun heat fresh growth rise cycle amplified climate imbalance frequency fire forest fire powerful difficult control era megafires australia amazon siberia footage million burnt vegetation hundred thousand dead animal awareness environmental safety risk huge blaze context prevention remedy scientist firefighter tool complexity fire spread artificial intelligence solution burn main advantage capacity complex calculation human day calculation researcher massive amount meteorological condition computer goal enable machine data model scientist future wildfire project month agent understanding environment supervise futuristic firefighting tool team lab california united university canada prediction agent firefighter recommendation burn forest natural process forest regeneration afp relaxnews,"[(3, 0.9928247)]",3
185269,Main,24,23/08/2020,Researchers develop AI breath test device to detect virus,,"JERUSALEM: A team of Chinese and Israeli researchers has devised a novel artificial intelligence (AI) breath analyser test to detect Covid-19 rapidly, the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) said.
The new device was developed by Technion researchers in collaboration with the University of Science and Technology of China, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Anhui Provincial Chest Hospital, all three located in the city of Hefei.
The device meets the need for a non-invasive, rapid and inexpensive testing method to screen Covid-19 positive individuals, especially pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers.
It is an intelligent nanotechnology consisting of a nanomaterial-­based sensor array, which can rapidly detect Covid-19 from specific volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath.
It can detect disease-specific biomarkers in exhaled breath with 92% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity, Technion said.

183175,Lifestyle,3,17/08/2020,AI helps Brazil fight pandemic,,"Doctors in Brazil, the country with the second-highest number of cases and deaths in the ­coronavirus pandemic, have a new tool in their fight against Covid-19: artificial intelligence to detect infections.
Under-testing remains a huge problem in the sprawling South American country, but AI is ­helping fill the gap, thanks to a system called RadVid-19 ­developed using algorithms from German company Siemens and Chinese firm Huawei.
Brazil has been hit harder by the pandemic than any country except the United States, with nearly 2.8 million infections and 95,000 deaths.
Experts say the numbers would be much higher if there were more widespread testing.
RadVid-19 seeks to fill that gap, and help doctors decide the right course of treatment for their patients.
It analyses chest X-rays and CT scans to find spots on patients’ lungs that are likely markers of infection by the new coronavirus.
“The software identifies those areas and estimates the probability of a case of Covid-19,” says Marcio Sawamura, deputy head of the radiology center at the University of Sao Paulo Clinical Hospital.The program shows doctors on a computer screen how their patients’ lungs are changing over time and enables them to analyse the white and yellow circles ­marking potential infection.
The software is being used by 43 Brazilian hospitals, 60% of them public, thanks in part to funding from the Inter-American Development Bank.
It is not a replacement for a lab-based diagnosis by a physician.
But it can help doctors decide what treatment to pursue during the sometimes long wait for lab results to come back, in a country where no large-scale testing ­campaign has been launched and President Jair Bolsonaro faces ­criticism for downplaying the ­pandemic.
Creativity in crisis
“Since Brazil is testing less than it should, CT scans and X-rays end up being used as diagnostic tools,” says Arthur Lobo, a radiologist in the northern city of Belem.
“It’s helped us reach diagnoses when we were in doubt.”
That was welcome relief in the early stages of the pandemic in Brazil, when doctors were racing to keep up with a rapidly exploding infection curve, says Claudia Leite, a professor in the radiology and oncology ­department at the University of Sao Paulo.“At the beginning, we were ­really in anguish, because ­sometimes the lab results were taking a long time to come back and the patient would start ­getting worse, developing breathing ­difficulty, and we still didn’t have a diagnosis,” she says.Using AI, she says, “we were able to conclude it was Covid and take the right measures. And the test results later confirmed it.”RadVid-19 had analysed 10,700 X-rays and CT scans as of the end of July.

181095,StarBiz,4,11/08/2020,Artificial intelligence  in a nutshell,,"Intelligence is something natural that every human possesses at different levels of life and the level, of course, depends on the measure of IQ and/or experience. Meanwhile, the word artificial is pretty much understood by being a copy of something natural produced by human. 
It is like the artificial flavouring you have in foods and beverages, as an example, the taste of durian in coffee; without the presence of that thorny fruit, tempting but weird.
If one combines the words artificial and intelligence, like the durian-flavoured coffee, you will have the creations of human intelligence without the presence of the natural yet powerful brain.
The “brain” is now taken over by intelligent machines that work and react like humans, slowly exceeding the potential of our natural thinking capacity. We often nod as if we understand every bit of the AI but the way it works is still perplexing to many.
How does the brain work?
Now that we understand the aim of AI is to imitate the thinking process in making decisions, it is inevitable for us to first comprehend the manner of how the human brain works. 
How do you come down to the decision of sipping that cup of durian-flavoured coffee prepared by your mother- in-law for example?
The brain consists of a billion nerve cells which coordinate your actions supported by a network of neurons that process inputs from the natural sensors of human being. Smells, visions, sounds and touches are the inputs from your nose, eyes, ears and fingertips which act as the sensory devices. 
The coffee in a cup presented to you is a matter of interest. All the inputs gained from the observations combined with your experiences are then processed by the brain before the big decision of sipping or refusing the cup of coffee is made. Still unclear?
Now imagine your actions in gaining the inputs. By the look of the liquid inside the cup being black, your brain classifies it as coffee. 
Smelling the aroma, you can tell that it has durian in it. Hearing continuous persuasion from your wife, “Drink it! It’s nice”, your brain tells you that sipping the coffee is of great importance to your marriage. 
You start touching the side of the cup; this time your brain tells you that the temperature is right. Combined with the knowledge that this coffee was prepared by your mother-in-law, therefore it wouldn’t be toxic (it might not apply to everyone); the decision you made is to sip it.
How does AI work?
Traditionally, AI is just a series of algorithm based on inputs and historical data. It is like the daily calculators with memories function but by means of very far more complex mathematics solving potencies.
Nowadays, AI is a very sophisticated tool with self-learning capability and often related to big data analytics. 
For as much you need to punch in the numbers that requires solving on your calculators, the same goes with AI solver, and these are referred as inputs.
This time around, imagine, you are blindfolded, handcuffed at the back of your body, ear plugged and nose fully stuffed. Your brain is now paralysed as the sensors can no longer supply its inputs in making decision about the coffee presented.
In letting the AI to act as your brain and decide whether to ignore or sip it, the acquisition of inputs must now be made available.
An electronic thermometer, digital camera, chemical sensors and microphone are simple probes to gather the necessary inputs imitating your finger, eyes, nose and ears.
Once all the signals from the probes are sent to the AI solver, decision is made by solving all that in pre-input formulas. 
It can be commands in hundreds of lines at which the answer to it is yes or no, metaphorically like the answer you get after punching the sign equal on your typical calculator. The major important features of the AI compared to traditional computers would be the ability to learn from historical data. It fixes the algorithm after every single iteration and this can be considered as the biggest breakthrough of mankind, very often referred as deep learning by the scientist. Identical to the human brain that uses experience to improve decision making, the more situations being fed into a machine, the more intelligent it gets day by day.
What is the risk of AI?
The biggest question frequently asked every time I finish my lectures is the potential of AI taking over humanity. 
My answer is always consistent, it will one day, but not in a hundred years. 
Mind you, the period can be shortened if the infrastructure improves tremendously by new findings, what is that? I will now be introducing more metaphor from this point forward.
Let us go back to the durian flavoured coffee example to understand the resources needed for AI to improve decision making.
When you decide to drink the coffee, the decision is made in a split of a second to of course, avoid the nagging from your mother in law. That is the unique ability of our god created brain; it processes information faster than the lightning. 
This is still in the infant stage with AI, the processor needs to be much faster and robust, and opposite to your phone that gets “hang” every now and then.
Next is to understand the learning process through the historical data or better known as data training. Human logic in thinking is so complicated and varies between cultures.
The type of smiles directed to you by your other half carries different meanings between a go or no go.
Only after years of marriage you would have all the experience to understand those smiles. That is data training complications in AI, scientist requires tremendous amount of inputs and outputs for the decision making and it would require massive investment for the gathering and processing activities.
The AI will eventually have the risk of overtaking human at the very end. 
Why would I say that? 
It is because the machine doesn’t age as fast as human being and starts losing the capability to think. Like a wise man become wiser with age, same goes with the AI getting smarter with data trainings. 
However, the later doesn’t carry the potential of being senile. 
An AI machine will remember every bit of inputs fed into it for as long you don’t erase it, meanwhile a wise man might one day, forget where is that reading glasses he wore just five minutes ago. 
Recently AI is popular with prediction, patterns of human behaviour are classified before the machine can decide on what information to feed. 
Take Google for example, it is now working like magician, feeding every interest that is related to you based on your browsing history. 
To whose advantage? That’s still a big question unanswered.
On that note, I would like to end this article by reminding the readers that we, humans, don’t often get to be a wise man at the age of 94 that is fit to think based on the vast experience he had. 
Contradictory to that, machines will never lose its memory and will only improve as the days go by. Grab a book and start reading before it (the AI) really takes over.……

177753,Lifestyle,5,03/08/2020,XOX ADVANCES CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH AI,,"ALTHOUGH consumer-based 
artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its infancy, many users the world over have been exposed to components of this new technological advancement in their daily lives.These AI parts range from 
simple elements that are integrated in social media, to more advance state-of-the-art face recognition, voice recognition, search tools, smart home, virtual assistant 
and more. 
There is no denying that AI is here to stay and is lauded as the bedrock of an advanced digital 
lifestyle. 
Throughout the years, AI has fuelled global consumerism in many ways. And one of the ways 
it works perfectly is through algorithms. 
According to the Oxford Dictionary, an algorithm is a 
“process or set of rules to be 
followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, 
especially by a computer”.
Advent of AI
But how does AI figure in? 
Well, have you ever casually mentioned looking for something to someone, only to have an advertisement for that item popping up on your browser, although you’ve haven’t searched for it online yet? 
That’s AI.
Today’s algorithms are constantly being improved upon to provide better performing recommendation systems. 
They now have parameters that can be fine-tuned to near perfection and made ready to serve consumers.
Dedicated ecosystem
Realising the importance of incorporating AI into its core practice, virtual mobile network operator (MVNO) XOX is taking the lead in the industry by creating its own AI ecosystem. 
This system will seamlessly attune itself to current consumer behaviours and is set to be a game changer in the industry. 
XOX’s AI ecosystem will leverage expertise in key areas to synergise between advanced technology and consumer needs. 
The company ensures a harmonised AI landscape by creating 12 key areas – XOX City (AI vending machines), cloud solutions, partnerships, fintech, insurance, marketplace, e-wallet, remote working, loyalty programme, digital ID and email, its proprietary BLACK app, and logistics.

175125,StarEdu,2,26/07/2020,Charging electrical vehicles with AI,,"MOVING towards a more sustainable future, an optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the works to facilitate wider use of the vehicle. 
“There are still many technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to ensure the widespread utilisation of EVs in transportation sectors. The development of an optimal EV charging scheme is an on-going project that is crucial to maximise the economic and environmental benefits of EVs,” said Asst Prof Dr Lim Wei Hong, UCSI University’s Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment deputy dean.
Invited as a visiting research scholar by National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), Taiwan, in December 2019, Dr Lim had the opportunity to work with his former advisor Prof Dr Leehter Yao in developing a new EV charging scheduling scheme.
Dr Lim’s main responsibility was to refine the algorithm design, and to implement coding as well as perform simulation analysis and prepare the manuscript.
“This project covered several crucial pillars of Industry Revolution 4.0 such as advanced simulation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing. Two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were also addressed in this project: Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities),” Dr Lim said.
One of the innovative points about the research project was the application of AI to predict the charging and discharging priority of each EV based on user behaviour. 
“AI was found to be an excellent approach to represent the relationship between the charging and discharging priority of EV with those input parameters such as the arrival and departure time of EVs, battery capacity time of EVs, initial energy stored in EV batteries, and EV staying time in parking stations,” Dr Lim said.
The research paper has been submitted to the international journal IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid and is currently under review.
“EVs have been acknowledged as the greener, more cost-efficient means of transportation and with battery charging as easy as charging one’s hand phone, it is certainly an option that seems more suitable for the present rather than just being reserved for the future,” Dr Lim said.
As EVs are powered by electricity, he said widespread use can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and subsequently lower air pollution and global warming.
Renewable energy such as solar power can be integrated into the EV parking station to fully or partially fulfil the power demands in charging the EVs, leading to the development of more sustainable infrastructures.

175111,StarEdu,3,26/07/2020,M’sians shine at global AI championship,,"AFTER nine months of intense work, a team of Malaysian students emerged global champions at the Atos IT Challenge 2020.
Team PestKillerBot stood out among teams from 27 countries, including Germany, China, France, India and the United Kingdom (UK).
The team from Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU) comprises Loo Chee Hin (team leader), Andrew Chung Hui Yue, Yong Ee Ren, and Yeo Khang Hsien – students of the Intelligent Systems and Cloud Computing programmes at APU. 
They walked away with 10,000 euro (RM48,600), and each student was offered the opportunity either to complete an internship at Atos or to work together with the company to develop their project.
This is the ninth instalment of the Atos IT Challenge – an international competition organised by Atos to empower students from around the world to develop applications connected to major trends in the digital revolution. 
This year, the theme of the competition was “Cooperative Artificial Intelligence”. Participating teams were required to develop real-world solutions using machine learning technologies. 
The students came up with an innovative concept of improving floriculture using cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) technology and pest-killing drones.
Their project, the PestKillerBot, is an easy-to-use application that eliminates pests in floricultural fields using drones that perform pest control and data collection through cooperative AI technology. 
It took them nine months to develop a drone prototype with a 3D printer and several components.
Each shortlisted team was coached and mentored by Atos staff worldwide. The team from APU were guided by Atos UK & Ireland client innovation head Andy Wallace.
“The topic of Cooperative Artificial Intelligence was a challenging one, made more so by the global lockdown caused by Covid-19. 
“The team from APU worked tirelessly to produce a superb application that wowed the judges and secured them the first place, ahead of excellent teams from prestigious universities in Croatia and Mexico,” said Wallace.
The competition’s first runner-up was Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores Monterrey, Mexico, whereas Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia, walked away the second runner-up.

169657,Main,26,12/07/2020,The future is AI technology,Global collaboration can fight pandemic and revive economies,"SHANGHAI: Due to Covid-19, the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) 2020 in Shanghai this week adopted a hybrid model where offline exhibitions and online displays took place simultaneously to showcase the latest artificial intelligence (AI) applications and frontier development.
More than 500 AI experts and executives, including Nobel laureates and Turing Award winners, attended this year’s WAIC held from Thursday to yesterday with the theme of “Intelligent Connectivity, Indivisible Community”.
AI has already demonstrated its potential to transform societies, economies and industries, but this is just the beginning, according to experts at the conference. 
WAIC plays a critical role in bringing people together to learn from one another and identify ways of collaborating to achieve more.
In recent years, AI has begun to play a significant role in many sectors. Prompted by the need to contain Covid-19, people around the world are looking toward AI-based techniques to aid the anti-pandemic fight.
Companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, SenseTime and iFlytek have been among the first to join the fight. Data modelling, crowd screening, and tracing contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases have been widely used to help control the spread of the coronavirus.
SenseTime, an AI-technology firm with its China headquarters and Global R&D headquarters in Shanghai that specialises in computer vision and deep learning, participated in this year’s event.
During the outbreak of Covid-19, SenseTime collaborated with seve­ral hospitals and medical institutions across China to assist Covid-19 diagnoses. 
The company upgraded its diagnosis application, which dramatically improved the effectiveness, accuracy, and speed of the current analysis of CT scans with the help of AI algorithms.
Screening large crowds is another area where AI shows its potential, particularly in public spaces such as the metro. AI firm Megvii, another exhibitor at WAIC, launched a remote temperature measurement system in subway stations in Beijing to help screen out passengers with a high fever. 
Compared with manual detection, the system can examine up to 300 people in one minute without disrupting passenger flows.
Shen Xiangyang, a professor from Tsinghua University, said during the conference that AI technology could play a significant role in remote diagnoses, vaccine development, virus analysis and global coordination.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to rising demand for online services, which at the same time created many new scenarios for AI applications. Many experts attending the WAIC saw AI as a new engine to stimulate growth in the post-coronavirus era.
Zhu Min, chairman of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, was upbeat about the prospects of the AI industry.

163991,StarBiz,4,29/06/2020,Tapping into 5G and AI,,"AGAINST fears of a second wave of coronavirus in the US and other countries, some companies in the semiconductor supply chain are tapping on the upcoming trends in 5G and artificial intelligence.
One such company is UWC Bhd that has been receiving orders despite the lockdowns.
For the long term, it intends to move up the value chain in the semiconductor industry to produce more front-end products.
UWC also sees prospects in the life science sector and even if an effective vaccine against the coronavirus is found, priorities on safety and health will ensure continued usage of healthcare-related equipment.
During the lockdown in China, the group did get some diversion of jobs from existing customers, which they accepted and are in the midst of delivery; it also received more enquiries from new customers.
With a plan to increase capacity, UWC is hiring engineers but finds that talent is hard to come by, even though there are so many unemployed people.
With the movement control order (MCO) period coming to an end and worldwide businesses gradually resuming, the group expects stronger sales from the second half onwards.
During the MCO, UWC was restricted to operate at 50% capacity which had resulted in a slowdown in work for March and April.
But it still managed to grow its revenue and profit after tax, year-on-year, by 45.7% and 65.9% respectively for the third quarter ended April 30.
Demand has been exceeding supply and despite the current disruption in the supply chain, UWC is able to meet a big portion of the demand.
Things will further improve when the MCO is lifted, and the Malaysian economy is on a gradual path of recovery.
As supply chain operations rev to full force, UWC’s operations will also reach 100% capacity.
The completion of work that has been backlogged will neutralise the weaker output during the MCO period.  
High demand
“We are optimistic that this high level of demand will sustain into the future,’’ said UWC deputy CEO Matin Ng.
Orders for the semiconductor sector remained strong during the MCO period, with no cancellations to date.
The group did incur higher operating expenses such as logistic costs, as well as expenses related to its production and standard operating procedures in sanitisation.
Overall, UWC is bullish on the semiconductor industry, as technology advancement will accelerate with the adoption of 5G and artificial intelligence.
Major countries are investing more into the semiconductor industry which is one of the foundational technologies that provides the edge in innovation.
The group’s strategy to produce more front-end products will help garner higher profits and margins.
More orders are also expected from the life science segment, where UWC is working closely with a new client to develop Covid-19 related equipment.
The life science business grew 6%, quarter to quarter; it contributed 20% to the latest quarterly results.
Amidst ongoing efforts to expand its customer base for the life science business, a second wave of coronavirus will potentially increase orders for its Covid-19 related test equipment and components.
Even if an effective vaccine is found, laboratory tests will still be conducted to enhance the effectiveness of the vaccine, or to detect any potential mutation of the virus.
“We ventured into the life science business a few years ago, and this has proven to be a very stable business for the group,’’ said Ng.UWC has 830 employees and plans to hire more engineers, in line with its expansion plans.
But amidst the bullish outlook on its businesses, its biggest challenge is to search for the right talent, especially following plans by multinationals to set up factories in Penang.
To create its own pipeline of talent, UWC is providing scholarships and working on the matter with institutes and universities.
The group aims to increase automation processing to reduce the usage of human capital and the likelihood of making errors.
Industrial robotic arms and collaborative robots or cobots are used on the production floor; due to the ramp-up in business, UWC has bought three units of automated material handlers instead of one, as stated in its listing prospectus.
More analytic software is being used; liquid crystal displays showing live data are installed on the production floor and computers or tablets are attached to machines for machine or shopfloor integration.
“We are on track to become a visual factory,’’ said Ng. “With just the tip of a finger, we are able to access our systems to track overall equipment effectiveness and machine performance.’’
With the data extracted from the machines and integrated with its cloud system, it is able to perform big data analysis.
During the lockdown period, UWC had requested for video conferencing to carry out the process of qualifying products.
This minimised disruptions to its operations, as it continued to receive enquiries from new and existing customers.
While its semiconductor supply chain and life science businesses are picking up momentum, the group is actively pursuing its goal towards higher automation and efficiency.

159689,StarBiz,3,18/06/2020,HCTM UKM ties up with  Green Packet on AI scanner,Hospital one of first few in country to have device,"PETALING JAYA: Green Packet Bhd has installed its KipleLive thermal scanners at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HCTM UKM), making it one of the first few hospitals in Malaysia to install artificial intelligence (AI) thermal scanners. 
KipleLive is a community-based safety solution that is recently incorporated with a built-in framework for Outbreak Prevention. 
Comprising AI thermal scanners, an app for users, and a backend platform for management, KipleLive helps the hospital adhere to the stringent standard operating procedures (SOPs) outlined by the government.
This entails having accurate contact tracing while allowing the hospital to operate at its full capacity through digitisation.
Green Packet group managing director and CEO CC Puan lauded HCTM UKM for its commitment to embark on digital innovations to uphold the high standard of healthcare in Malaysia. 
“We are pleased to be a technology partner for HCTM UKM. 
“I hope that more healthcare practitioners will follow suit and leverage on the power of digital technologies to combat the spread of Covid-19,” he said in a press release yesterday, adding that Green Packet is committed and determined to build safe and secure communities.
As HCTM UKM prepares for the new normal and joins the list of Green Packet’s nationwide “We Are Ready” campaign, the Covid-19 infection transmission is expected to be broken in due time.
HCTM UKM director Prof Datuk Hanafiah Harunarashid said it is imperative to protect frontline healthcare professionals in order to attend to the needs of the people.
“It is good news to all Malaysians that the daily reported new Covid-19 cases have decreased over the past few days but we cannot sit back and rest on our laurels. 
“We still need to continue practising good personal hygiene and maintain safe social distancing at least one metre away from others,” he said. 
The thermal scanners installed at HCTM UKM’s main entrance of the lobby as well as other entrances that are accessible to staff, patients and visitors, will ensure that frontline professionals are always protected while making the hospital a safe environment for patients and visitors.
Apart from that, all manual work and manpower required can be greatly reduced by banking on digital technologies that are able to streamline procedures as well as AI thermal scanners that scan and measure each individual’s body temperature within seconds, 
Additionally, KipleLive can be used symbiotically with another Green Packet fintech brand KiplePay, an e-wallet payment system. 
The long-term partnership between Green Packet and HCTM UKM will open up more opportunities, such as enabling an end-to-end cashless ecosystem for HCTM UKM patients to make online payments on hospital bills using a single app.
Earlier, Green Packet, via its associate G3 Global Bhd, had already installed AI thermal scanners in a number of buildings in Malaysia, including Istana Negara, Parliament buildings, and the KL International Airport. 
Progressing from that, Green Packet then installed KipleLive thermal scanners at Paradigm Mall, The Ascent Corporate Towers, Pavilion Tower, Rafflesia Private and International Schools, Desa Park International schools as well as the premises of The Star Media Group and Sin Chew Daily.
Recently, Green Packet had partnered with United Chinese School Committee’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong) to deploy KipleLive thermal scanners across 63 independent Chinese secondary schools nationwide.
Just two weeks after Green Packet’s We Are Ready campaign launch on May 7, the group achieved a sales pipeline of 10,000 units of KipleLive.
KipleLive has also been receiving significant interest from a number of countries including Indonesia, Vietnam, the US, as well as the European Union Parliament, which is keen to explore the usage of KipleLive in European countries.
With such high demand for KipleLive, Green Packet is optimistic that KipleLive will achieve its sales target of RM60mil by the third quarter of this year. As such, this will be a boost to the overall earnings of Green Packet this year.
Green Packet offers four types of KipleLive solutions, catering to various needs of each business or premise.
The SenseTime Nebula is for use in public or open areas such as airports, railway stations, bus terminals and hospitals.
This device is able to detect up to 10 people at one time and is capable of capturing a lot of data within a three metre radius.
Meanwhile, the SenseThunder-E and SenseThunder-E Mini, priced between RM20,000 and RM80,000 is suitable for use in restricted and closed areas such as building entrances, shopping malls, hotels, and government buildings.
Small or medium size areas such as offices, schools, restaurants and factories can deploy the KipleLive FR thermal scanner which is now offered at RM6,800 per unit.

158773,Lifestyle,4,15/06/2020,Human fighter pilot to go up against AI-manned aircraft,,"Earlier this month, Air Force Magazine reported that the US Air Force will be putting a human pilot up against an autonomous aircraft in air-to-air combat next July.
Researchers for the United States Air Force are developing an AI-powered autonomous aircraft that could ­potentially take down a human-manned aircraft; their goal is to put a human pilot up against this AI in air-to-air combat – which was a challenge inspired by ­statements made by Elon Musk earlier this year – in July 2021.
While the head of the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan states that the research team is “probably going to have a hard time ­getting to that flight next year... when the machine beats the human... If he does it, great.”
This project was originally launched in 2018.
The research team’s leader Steve Rogers says: “Our human pilots, the ­really good ones, have a couple thousand hours of experience. What happens if I can augment their ability with a system that can have literally millions of hours of training time?... How can I make myself a tactical autopilot so in an air-to-air fight, this system could help make decisions on a timeline that humans can’t even begin to think about?”
If the team accomplishes this, they intend to implement this type of ­technolo- gy in maintenance operations and battle planning software. – AFP Relaxnews",month air force magazine air force human pilot autonomous aircraft air air combat july researcher air force autonomous aircraft human aircraft goal human pilot air air combat challenge statement elon musk head pentagon joint artificial intelligence center gen jack shanahan team hard time flight machine human project team leader rogers human pilot couple hour experience augment ability system million hour time tactical autopilot air air fight system decision human team accomplishes implement type technolo maintenance operation battle planning software relaxnews,"[(4, 0.98770213)]",4
155785,StarBiz 7,16,06/06/2020,Seizing the opportunities of AI,SMEs to benefit from more cost-effective use of hardware,"DESPITE the breakneck speed of technological advancements these days, one of the first things that Alvin Koh noticed when he returned home from Australia was the lack of effort in driving the development of machine learning to solve real problems. 
Noting that there was enormous potential in this technology, the former banker took it upon himself to exploit the capabilities of machine learning to make life a lot easier for other businesses. 
He started artificial intelligence (AI) optical solution company Blinkware Technology in 2013 to help organisations reduce the risk of failures or downtime in their operations. 
The firm’s main application also enables companies to increase operational efficiency, improve product compliance, process data instantly, get a better understanding of their supply chain and customers as well as reduce cost thanks to predictive maintenance.
Koh, who is also chief executive officer, says the company’s technology platform can be applied across various industries such as automotive, textiles, rubber, F&B, logistics and agriculture.
Leveraging its platform can help businesses save considerable cost and time, he says, especially when compared to using manual labour – which is still the case for many companies today – to perform the same tasks. 
Blinkware has its own patented optical recognition software technology that enables lower-cost hardware to function at the same quality and efficiency as expensive higher-end peripherals. 
Although Blinkware started life as an interactive digital media company providing tailored motion sensor advertising and marketing solutions, it moved into deep tech in 2016 with the development of its own AI optical recognition technology which can be tailored to fit multiple industries.
What sets them apart from most other software providers in the market is their ability to integrate their camera technology into existing platforms by utilising low cost hardware that makes use of 2D cameras.
This is especially useful in pushing for wider adoption of automation in manufacturing processes among small and medium scale companies, which make up a large chunk of South-East Asia’s economies. Many of these companies do not have the budget to spend on high-end devices but stand to benefit greatly from the efficiency of the latest technology.
For now, Blinkware is focused on growing its hardware agnostic AI system for manufacturing services as it has one of the biggest growth potential for the company.
Citing a study by global consulting firm McKenzie, Koh says the manufacturing sector in Asean could add up to US$311bil in additional value creation by adopting automation and AI in the production process.
The company’s optical research and development (R&D) arm is currently working with automotive manufacturers to provide integrated optical technology which can be used to assist them in the quality control processes.
Making partnerships
Blinkware has been approached by a China-based strategic investor and is also fielding interest from a Japanese partner who are keen to tap into the company’s proprietary AI technologies, Koh highlights.
During the coronavirus period, other investors have also shown keen interest in Blinkware as the company expands its capabilities into AI medical technology and peripherals for mass Covid-19 testing and surveillance, he adds.
Blinkware currently has eight shareholders. Koh holds the second largest stake in the company.
On a wider scale, though, the firm has formed a strategic business alliance with Fujitsu to expand across South-East Asia. The Japanese IT company has helped expand its technologies and opened up markets for Blinkware in Indonesia and Thailand. 
“This collaboration provides us with technical as well as sales and marketing support,” he says.
This will give the company a boost as it looks to recover and grow from the shadows of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Koh expects the next 18 months to be an extremely volatile period as many sectors are still trying to grasp the full impact of the lockdown and businesses are still trying to navigate the situation and put their recovery plans into action.
“Specifically related to our clients and their industries, the current turbulence coupled with economic uncertainties due to the lockdown have rendered many non-essential manufacturers inoperable. This has heavily impacted their production, causing massive losses due to high operating costs and low productivity.
“They are still working through cost cutting exercises and refocussing their budgets to ensure high productivity remains at the lowest cost.
“For us, this period has provided many new projects, in particular, manufacturing clients who are still running very traditional processes heavily dependent on human resource, onsite management of the supply chain and manual reporting channels,” shares Koh.
The company is currently busy reaching out to various SMEs and government agencies to educate them on the use of AI in their processes to reduce human bias and increase accuracy in their workflow. 
The good thing about using technology is that even if a system makes a mistake, it can be fixed.
Given the huge potential for the company, Blinkware is looking to expand its team to meet future demand. 
It currently has 30 employees, of which 70% are programmers. 
One of the biggest challenges for Blinkware is to hire enough talents to scale faster and ensure quick and smooth delivery of its projects. The competition for talents in the AI industry is fierce and expensive, says Koh, and Blinkware has to compete for highly skilled programmers and IT engineers with companies from the Silicon Valley, China and even Singapore. 
With good talents in high demand, the company – or even Malaysia – will have to put out an offer enticing enough for their consideration. 
Operating in a new normalBeing a young company, Blinkware has little problem embracing the new working conditions recommended under the movement control order. 
Koh says the company has been productive even when half the team is working from home, leaving only critical roles including R&D to be based in the office.
“With a high percentage of our workforce being millennials, working from home was second nature to our team members and surprisingly, it has worked very well of us with a heightened sense of accountability and greater engagement levels across departments.
“In fact, we had been toying with the idea of working from home since 2019 but this pandemic forced that decision for us and has proven to us that it works. 
“Our client meetings are now predominantly via web-conference calls and with the reduced time needed for travel to meet with our clients, it allows our front line operations to be more engaged with our clients during the day, which is also the reason that we are continuing the work from home practice even after this,” says Koh.
Those working at the office continue to abide by strict standard operating procedures on social distancing. He notes that seating arrangements have been changed and meetings limited to four people in a room at one time. 
“This is to ensure we are playing our role to combat and eradicate the relapse of Covid-19 with the relaxing of the lockdown in phases,” he adds.
He also says that many of the practices during the movement restrictions have taught the company to forego certain costs.
“Being able to consolidate our work force without multiple offices or branches and costly asset maintenance and inventory have enabled us to keep lean, nimble and cost effective during this difficult and uncertain times.”
As a company with its core operations in software, Blinkware is in a good position to pivot and grow fast during this time due to its fairly low operational cost model.
Koh says the company continues to educate potential clients and various stakeholders on the benefits of AI technology. 
For example, in the medical field, the company aims to combat future respiratory-type pandemics by arming countries with AI technology to help them manage their first line of defence. The technology will be able to ensure that every individual can be checked efficiently.
This will allow more individuals who have tested negative for Covid-19 to return to work, thereby reducing the risk of a drastic economic downturn. 
Additionally, it will also help positive and possible cases to be segmented for isolation and testing to prevent future outbreaks.
Other areas that the company is developing which will be ready soon are platforms that will be able to identify individual temperatures in a mass setting using AI facial recognition and highly accurate thermal sensing cameras. 
This will help organisations take a proactive approach to combating the spread of Covid-19 in mass areas including airports, religious gatherings and schools as they reopen.
“Most of our overheads are currently in R&D-based human capital, which we are still hiring to grow our talent base of programmers to expand on our new projects,” he says.
Having spent close to 20 years working in the relatively rigid financial industry, making the switch to a fast-paced technology and AI world has certainly not been an easy feat for Koh. But leading a team of innovators with a clear vision on how to bring the benefits of technological advancements to businesses has been rather satisfying. 
Perhaps, Blinkware is also positioned to be the local champion to push other businesses to level up the technology value chain, he mulls as he concludes.",breakneck speed technological advancement day koh australia lack effort development machine solve real enormous potential technology banker exploit capability machine life lot easier business artificial intelligence optical solution company blinkware technology organisation risk failure operation firm main application company operational efficiency product compliance process data supply chain customer cost predictive maintenance koh chief executive officer company technology platform industry automotive textile logistics platform business considerable cost time manual labour company task blinkware optical recognition software technology lower cost hardware function quality efficiency expensive peripheral blinkware life interactive digital medium company tailored motion sensor advertising marketing solution deep tech development optical recognition technology fit multiple industry set software provider market ability camera technology platform low cost hardware camera wider adoption automation manufacturing medium scale company south east asia economy company budget device benefit technology blinkware hardware agnostic system manufacturing service biggest growth potential company study global consulting firm koh manufacturing sector asean bil additional creation automation production process company optical development arm automotive manufacturer integrated optical technology assist quality control partnership blinkware china strategic investor japanese partner keen tap company proprietary technology highlight coronavirus period investor blinkware company capability medical technology peripheral covid surveillance blinkware shareholder largest stake company scale firm strategic business alliance fujitsu expand east japanese company technology market indonesia thailand collaboration technical sale support company recover grow pandemic koh month volatile period sector impact lockdown business situation recovery action client industry current turbulence economic uncertainty rendered essential manufacturer inoperable production massive loss cost low productivity cost cutting budget productivity lowest cost period project client traditional process dependent human resource onsite management supply chain manual reporting channel share company busy smes government agency process human bias increase accuracy technology system huge potential company blinkware team meet future demand employee programmer biggest challenge hire talent faster quick smooth delivery project competition talent industry fierce expensive koh blinkware compete skilled programmer engineer company valley china singapore talent company malaysia offer consideration company blinkware condition movement control company productive half team critical role office percentage workforce millennials team sense accountability engagement level department idea decision client meeting conference call time travel meet client front operation client day reason practice koh office continue strict standard operating procedure social note arrangement meeting limited people time role combat relapse covid lockdown phase practice movement restriction company forego cost force multiple office branch costly asset maintenance inventory lean nimble cost effective difficult uncertain time company core operation software blinkware position pivot fast time low operational cost model company potential client stakeholder benefit technology medical field company combat future respiratory type pandemic country technology manage defence technology individual individual negative covid return risk drastic economic downturn positive isolation prevent future outbreak company ready platform individual temperature facial recognition accurate thermal camera organisation proactive approach spread covid mass airport religious gathering school overhead human capital hiring grow talent base programmer project close rigid financial industry switch technology easy feat koh team innovator benefit technological advancement business blinkware local champion push business technology chain mull concludes,"[(0, 0.998206)]",0
155099,StarBiz,3,04/06/2020,"Green Packet, FIVE unveil AI-powered petrol stations",New service set to reinvent users’ experience,"PETALING JAYA: As part of the second series of its campaign known as #DigitalReady, Green Packet Bhd has teamed up with Five Petroleum Malaysia Sdn Bhd (FIVE) to launch the first artificial intelligence (AI)-powered petrol station in Malaysia and reinvent the whole fuelling users’ experience.
In a statement, Green Packet said the collaboration with FIVE brought forth the frictionless and cashless digital experience across all FIVE petrol stations, leveraging on the frontier technologies like AI and machine learning and coupled with a suite of Green Packet’s technological innovations such as e-KYC, e-wallet, payment gateway and license plate recognition.
According to FIVE managing director Datuk Seri Dr King Lim, it is the company’s mission to help Malaysia to raise its bar to the next development. 
“Like in FIVE, our first AI-powered petrol station is not just meant to provide a hassle-free fuelling experience. It is also to harmonise the whole digital solution from making fuel payments to purchasing goods in the retail stores under one integrated platform.”
On top of that, FIVE will co-develop a new mobile application with Green Packet via its Kiple brand to facilitate cashless payment as well as including a spectrum of offerings in the app itself such as loyalty, discounts and P2P transfer.
“Gone are the days of carrying around an additional membership card. With our new mobile application, users can enjoy a much personalised experience in their every trip to the nearest FIVE stations as they can register, collect, manage and spend their rewards within the application. This will eventually create strong brand loyalty among users,” Lim added. 
Green Packet managing director C.C. Puan said the system could automatically identify the driver’s pre-filled information by scanning the user’s license plate upon entering the petrol station. 
Once identified, users will receive a push notification on their mobile phone for quick approval of payment. The refuelling process then becomes more efficient and less tedious.
“Beyond that, the facial recognition technology will allow the users to enjoy a much pleasing experience in both loyalty and rewards at Woo! Mart, Five’s own branded convenience stores. 
“Users simply have to stand in front of a point-of-sale terminal and the AI system will identify the user and approves user profile which is linked to your mobile phone,” Puan said.

155147,StarBiz,10,04/06/2020,Hedge fund  in Sweden trounces return goal with  rare AI model,,"STOCKHOLM: A Swedish hedge fund called Volt Capital Management AB has run circles around its own return target by relying on a form of artificial intelligence (AI) it says is unique.
Volt Diversified Alpha Program was created in early 2017 by Jukka Harju, a former researcher at Lynx Asset Management. It only has about US$30mil under management, but this year it’s delivered more than double the 10% return target it promised investors. Instead, they’ve received 24%. In March, when Covid-19 triggered a global selloff across markets, Volt had a positive return of 12%.
Patrik Safvenblad, the fund’s chief investment office, said his models, once plugged into Volt’s AI programme, helped him position for the slump in oil markets, and for gains in bonds and the dollar. “It’s best for us when the fundamentals change,” he said in an interview last week. “For example this year, the oil price fundamentally changed.”
Volt is doing “something that is unique within machine learning,” Safvenblad said. “We take the power of fundamental models – we believe in fundamentals, fundamentals matter – we combine that power with machine learning.”
He said the model addressed two problems. “If you trade based on fundamentals, you have a problem to choose from your models. If you do machine learning based on technical signals, you risk ending up with so called false positives.”
Instead, Volt has chosen 200 models it thinks will make money. But, “we don’t know exactly when, or how to weight them,” Safvenblad said. “We use machine learning to handle the daily weighting problem.”
Some of the hedge fund industry’s biggest names experienced deep setbacks in March, including firms run by Ray Dalio, Michael Hintze and Adam Levinson, Bloomberg News reported in April.
Volt’s investment horizon is relatively short, averaging about 12 trading days. The fund holds roughly 70 positions at any given time. Its analysis shows that the economy will stay weak.

He’s short soft commodities and “a bit short equities.” Long bets include gold, platinum, fixed income in Europe and the US, as well as the Greenback against the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
“The market is always right,” Safvenblad said. “We don’t think we know better than the market. So when something goes against us, we decrease exposure to those positions, models and sectors.

149903,StarBiz,9,20/05/2020,"Sony, Microsoft strike dealThe outcome is a tiny AI chip with huge potential",,"TOKYO: Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp have partnered to embed artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into the Japanese company’s latest imaging chip, a big boost for a camera product the electronics giant describes as a world-first for commercial customers.
The new module’s big advantage is that it has its own processor and memory built in, which allows it to analyse video using AI tech like Microsoft’s Azure, but in a self-contained system that’s faster, simpler and more secure to operate than existing methods.
The two companies are appealing to retail and logistics businesses with potential uses like optimising warehouse and factory automation, quantifying the flow of customers through stores and making cars smarter about their drivers and environment.
At a time of increasing public surveillance to help rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus, this new smart camera also has the potential to offer more privacy-conscious monitoring. 
And should its technology be adapted for personal devices, it even holds promise for advancing mobile photography.
Instead of generating actual images, Sony’s AI chip can analyse the video it sees and provide just metadata about what’s in front of it -- saying instead of showing what’s in its frame of vision. 
Because no data is sent to remote servers, opportunities for hackers to intercept sensitive images or video are dramatically reduced, which should help allay privacy fears.
Apple Inc has already proven the efficacy of combining AI and imaging to create more secure systems with its Face ID biometric authentication, powered by the iPhone’s custom-designed Neural Engine processor. 
Huawei Technologies Co and Alphabet Inc’s Google also have dedicated AI silicon in their smartphones to assist with image processing. 
These on-device chips represent what’s known as edge computing: handling complex AI and machine-learning tasks at the so-called edge of the network instead of sending data back and forth to servers.
“We are aware many companies are developing AI chips and it’s not like we try to make our AI chip better than others,” said Hideki Somemiya, senior general manager of Sony’s System Solutions group. 
“Our focus is on how we can distribute AI computing across the system, taking cost and efficiency into consideration. Edge computing is a trend, and in that respect, ours is the edge of the edge.”
Sony’s advance is to eliminate the need for transfers within the device itself. 
Whereas Apple and Google still use conventional image sensors that convert light particles into computer-readable image formats for their chips to read, Sony’s new part is capable of doing the analytical work without any data leaving its physical boundaries.
The AI-capable sensor may also help advance augmented reality applications. 
The two US giants, whose iOS and Android operating systems control practically the entire smartphone market, are heavily invested in AR development. 
Google Maps now offers the option to show 3-D directions atop a video feed of a user’s surroundings while Apple is planning new 3-D cameras on its next set of iPhones in the fall. 
The agenda-setters of the mobile industry are looking for ever smarter mobile cameras, spurring the demand for more sophisticated imaging gear.
Sony already enjoys a substantial lead as the world’s foremost provider of image sensors, counting Apple, Samsung Electronics Co and every major Chinese smartphone maker among its customers along with pro camera stalwarts like Hasselblad V, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Nikon Corp.
Its next set of customers may be automakers.
The AI-powered Sony sensor is capable of recording high-resolution video and simultaneously conducting its AI analysis at up to 30 frames each second. 
That rapid, up-to-the-microsecond responsiveness makes it potentially suitable for in-car use such as detecting when a driver is falling asleep, Sony’s Somemiya said. 
Without the need for a “cloud brain” as some existing systems have, Sony’s AI sensor could hasten the adoption of smart-car technology.
”This on-chip approach enables a system design to be more flexible and even optimised, given that the cost of image processing, which is one of the most compute-intensive tasks for autonomous driving, can be offloaded from an electronic control unit,” said Shinpei Kato, founder and chief technology officer of Tokyo-based Tier IV Inc, which develops self-driving software. — Bloomberg",tokyo sony corp microsoft corp embed artificial intelligence capability japanese company chip boost camera product electronics giant commercial customer module advantage processor memory analyse video tech microsoft azure system simpler secure operate method company retail logistics business potential optimising warehouse factory automation flow customer store car driver environment time public surveillance rein coronavirus smart camera potential offer privacy conscious monitoring technology personal device mobile photography actual image chip analyse video metadata front frame vision data server opportunity hacker sensitive image allay privacy fear apple create secure system biometric authentication iphone custom neural engine processor huawei technology google silicon smartphones assist image processing device chip edge complex machine learning task edge network data server aware company chip chip hideki senior manager sony system solution distribute system cost efficiency consideration edge trend respect edge edge sony advance eliminate transfer apple google conventional image sensor light particle computer readable image format chip sony capable analytical data physical boundary capable sensor advance reality application giant android system control entire smartphone market development google map option direction video feed user surroundings apple planning camera iphones agenda setter industry smarter mobile camera demand imaging gear sony substantial lead foremost provider image sensor apple samsung electronics major chinese smartphone maker customer camera stalwart fujifilm holding corp set customer automaker sony sensor capable resolution video analysis frame rapid microsecond responsiveness suitable car driver asleep sony somemiya cloud brain system sony sensor hasten adoption smart car technology chip approach system design flexible optimised cost image compute intensive task autonomous offloaded electronic control unit shinpei kato founder chief technology officer tokyo tier develops software bloomberg,"[(2, 0.9967016)]",2

129095,StarMetro,5,28/03/2020,THE FUTURE THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,,"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) is the wave of the future. This area of computer science emphasising the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans is heavily influencing and taking over the way we get on with daily life. 
More importantly, it is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is done, being already widely used in applications including automation, data analytics and natural language processing.
On a bigger spectrum, from self-driving cars to voice-initiated mobile phones and computer-
controlled robots, the presence of AI is seen and felt almost everywhere. 
As more industries shift towards embracing the science of incorporating human intelligence in machines so the latter can function, think and work like humans, the demand for human capital with the relevant skill and expertise correspondingly increases. 
As such, the question is, how do engineering students ride this wave and make the most of it? 
AI has a high learning curve but the rewards of a career in AI far outweigh the investment of time and energy. 
Unlike most conventional careers, AI is still in its infancy stage although several modern nations have fully embraced the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Taking this into account, UCSI University has taken the initiative to develop the Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) programme.
The nation’s best private university for two years in a row, according to the two recent QS World University Rankings exercises, proactively defines its own AI curriculum to offer educational content that can help increase the supply of AI engineers with job-ready graduates and real world experiences. 
The AI programme at UCSI consists of a number of specialisations and several overlapping disciplines, including mathematical and statistical methods, computer sciences and other AI core subjects to provide a conceptual framework in providing solutions for real-world engineering problems. 
The first two years covers core theoretical knowledge such as mathematics and statistics, algorithm design and computer programming, as well as electrical and electronics. 
Students will progress to the AI subfields by selecting the specialisation elective tracks covering emerging areas such as machine learning, decision-making and robotics, perception and language and human-AI interaction, among others. 
UCSI Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment dean Asst Prof Ts Dr Ang Chun Kit pointed out that AI was “unavoidably” the way forward. 
“We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system. 
“This programme was developed with a vision to provide the foundation for future growth in producing more complex and high-value products for industry sectors in Malaysia,” he said.
Leading the faculty in which 46 of its members have PhDs, Ang emphasised the university focuses on research attachment abroad and has established partnerships with key industry players. 
The faculty also stands out in terms of receiving grants to advance high impact projects. 
Students from the faculty are also annually selected for researches at world-renowned universities such as Imperial College London and Tsinghua University. 
The faculty also strives to give students field experience through internships at various top companies. 
An example would be Harry Hoon Jian Wen, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student. He was selected to go to the University of Queensland for a research attachment while also successfully completing his internship at Schneider Electric.

125941,StarEdu,5,22/03/2020,AI can’t replace accountants,,"YES, automation exists in accounting. And no, you won’t lose your job to it.
Since its existence in 1970s, the Sunway University Business School Department of Accounting has not seen a decrease in the number of accounting jobs, says its head Prof Raymond Patrick McNamara.
In fact, there are still a lot of accounting-related posts out there and according to a 2018 Tracer Study, 95% of accounting and finance graduates find employment within six months of graduating.
On Jobstreet Malaysia, there are about 3,400 accounting positions in Malaysia with about 1,300 of them within the taxation sector at the beginning this year, he notes.
He says there is in fact a shortage of accountants as many don’t remain in that role throughout their career,  especially in big firms.
“If you go into the corporate field, you can work your way up to chief executive officer, chief financial officer or managing director.”
Individuals in these roles spend more time doing negotiations for the company and helping to chart the company’s direction, he adds.
He says that an accountant’s role is essentially to provide information and assure that the information is correct.
“So, there’s no need to worry that accounting jobs will be gone anytime soon due to IR4.0.
“Don’t confuse accounting with bookkeeping.”
He explains that bookkeeping is the actual recording of the transaction and this was already automated since the 70s.
That process continues to be automated. So, big transactions in those companies like payroll and accounts payable have been outsourced to companies that specialise in doing just this, he says.
“These areas are also easy to automate because it’s fairly routine,” he says, adding that these jobs have been slowly disappearing over the past 50 years.
Although bookkeeping roles have been automated, accountants still need to know how to do it to ensure there is no wrong information logged into the systems.
In the end, their job is still to supervise the automated processes.
An accountant, he says, has to pay close attention to the systems.
Some of these systems are taught to accounting degree students in a standard subject called Accounting Information Systems.
This subject covers, among others, the controls within accounting computer systems to ensure that there is no fraud and that information is complete, accurate and timely.
“For example, accountants need to be alert to ensure credit fraud does not occur.
“Some computer systems would not be able to detect transaction flaws like charging interest on credit cards when the bill has already been paid but not reflected in the system.
“This is where an accountant’s keen eye is needed as this is not an easily automated process.”
Human intelligence, he adds, is still needed to think of ways that fraud can be committed and to ensure that the computer systems are not compromised.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) looks like it can do this “thinking” for us, the sky high cost means only massive firms can afford them, he continues.
He says that there has been talk of AI taking over credit scoring but that hasn’t materialised.
“Both Google and Facebook said they were going to do it but they haven’t.
“It’s not as easy as people think. You hear that computers are better at forecasting than humans are but there’s no research evidence to support that,” he adds.
The field of forensic auditing is being affected by IR4.0 though, he says, adding that this is due to developments in data analysis.
Cybercrime, he says, is an area of great concern and it’s where one needs a combination of auditing and technological skills.
“You can train as an auditor but you also need to be trained in technology. We want to get our students future-ready.
“We give them the thinking skills that make them adaptive,” he says, stressing that accountants need to understand why a process exists and why it needs to be enhanced to prevent fraud.",automation lose job existence university business school department accounting decrease accounting job prof raymond patrick mcnamara lot accounting post study accounting finance employment month jobstreet malaysia accounting position taxation sector shortage accountant role career firm corporate field chief executive officer chief financial officer director individual role time negotiation company chart company direction accountant role provide assure correct job confuse accounting bookkeeping actual transaction process transaction company account payable outsourced company easy routine job role accountant wrong system job process accountant pay close attention system system degree student subject accounting system subject cover computer system fraud complete accurate timely accountant alert credit fraud computer system detect transaction flaw credit card bill reflected system accountant keen eye process human intelligence fraud committed computer system artificial intelligence sky cost massive firm talk credit google facebook easy people computer human evidence support field forensic development data analysis cybercrime concern combination technological skill auditor technology student ready thinking skill adaptive accountant understand process exists prevent fraud,"[(6, 0.9943739)]",6
119615,StarBiz,4,09/03/2020,How artificial intelligence will change the construction sector,,"In 2016, to the shock of many, the Alpha Go computer program, developed by Google Deep Mind, managed to beat professional Go player Lee Sedol. 
Experts believed then that development of a program that could beat the complex game of Go was at least five years in the future.
That momentous event spurred the Chinese government to release the next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in 2017. 
This is a comprehensive strategy to advance the development of AI in China to catch up with the US by 2020, overtake it by 2025 and become the global leader by 2030. Thus the seeds of the current US- China trade war were sown.
Meanwhile in the US, private corporations such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Tesla are largely responsible for the US’s current competitive edge in AI. The US also remains the leader when it comes to the amount of funding, number of AI firms and patents filed. 
US companies such as Google, Nvidia and Tesla have a leading edge in manufacturing the most powerful AI chips.
Across the causeway, the Singapore Government has just rolled out their national strategy on AI. It has invested US$500mil on AI and other digital technologies through 2020 and has attracted Chinese and American firms to the country with policies that support AI research.
The global construction industry has grown by only 1% per year over the past few decades.
Compare this with a growth rate of 3.6% in manufacturing, and 2.8% for the whole world economy. Productivity, or the total economic output per worker, has remained flat in construction. 
In comparison, productivity has grown 1500%in retail, manufacturing, and agriculture since 1945.
One of the reasons for this is that construction is one of the most under-digitized industries in the world and is slow to adopt new technologies (McKinsey, 2017). McKinsey expects the spread of AI in the construction sector to be modest in the immediate future. 
Nonetheless, a shift is coming.
AI is an aggregative term for describing when a machine mimics human cognitive functions, like problem-solving, pattern recognition, and learning. Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” from data, without being explicitly programmed. At the moment machine vision and speech recognition already surpass human capabilities.
Machine learning and AI are helping make job sites more efficient and saving money.
AI solutions that have made an impact in other industries are beginning to emerge in the construction industry. The potential applications of machine learning and AI in construction are vast. 
Let’s look at a few examples to illustrate the potential changes.
In order to plan and design the construction of a building, 3D models need to take into consideration the architecture, engineering, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) plans and the sequence of activities of the respective teams. 
The challenge is to ensure that the different models from the sub- teams do not clash with each other. 
The industry is trying to use machine learning in the form of “generative design” to identify and mitigate clashes between the different models generated by the different teams in the planning and design phase to prevent rework. 
Thanks to “generative design” tools, even complex plumbing, mechanical and electrical work can be theorised within 3D modelling design, meaning logistical challenges can be worked through while planning, saving time and costs in the building stages.
Robotic capability is still quite primitive and requires controlled conditions for AI to be useful. However autonomous construction equipment are already in production that can undertake repetitive tasks like earthworks and haulage of earthwork materials, pouring concrete, bricklaying, welding, and demolition.
These machines can undertake these works more efficiently than their human counterparts. The growth of efficient construction will be further enabled by the rollout of 5G wireless technology. 
5G will provide the platform for remote operations of construction equipment miles away. This will be a significant boost to productivity of civil construction where the constraint of operators will become nullified.
Construction sites are especially risky due to the number of variables involved. One way to mitigate the dangers on a construction site is to do as little as possible at the site – or move the construction site altogether. 
A combination of AI and robotics can produce prefabricated construction, which allows building elements to be built in a controlled factory and then transported to a construction site. 
This process controls many of the would-be hazards on a standard construction site, and completes the most dangerous tasks without risking human injury. 
A second application that is poised to have a huge impact on construction is image tagging and analysis. We already see powerful AI at work in social media, where algorithms identify facial patterns to automatically tag individual people with astonishing accuracy. 
The same AI technology, with new training, can be used to identify and analyse safety hazards, categorise and tag site photography, and send notifications when PPE is not being properly used on the job site. 
It can even be used to identify who is violating safety standards, and tag them for their supervisors to address the problem.
AI will have minimal impact on the labour component of the construction industry in the immediate future. Instead the initial impact will be white collar staff who will find that the mundane aspects of their work will get automated. 
This requires engineers, quantity surveyors and site inspectors to develop new skillsets to prepare for the future when AI will become more prevalent in the construction industry. 
So what can the industry do to prepare for the new paradigm that will emerge. Firstly institutions like Institution of Engineers, Institution of Quantity Surveyors and Institution of Surveyors need to instill greater awareness of AI among its members through articles in their monthly magazines, talks from experts in this field and the setting up of online research libraries for their members to keep abreast of the latest developments. 
Secondly, development boards like CIDB need to formulate and AI strategy for the Industry similar to what MDEC is undertaking for the SME’s.
The key success factor in AI deployment is in the collection of data that is tagged. Vast amount of data needs to be utilised to train AI computer logarithms to learn and be able to classify objects or make decisions. 
One approach is to have all drawings submitted for planning approval in BIM to ensure that building plans are digitised going forward. Finally, there will an explosive demand for data scientists.
MDEC predicts that there will be a demand for 15,000 data professionals in 2020 when currently there are only 7,000. If this skill shortage is not bridged then we will have to import these skilled professionals from overseas. 
Politically this will be difficult situation for the government as job losses by locals will be replaced by imported foreign professionals.
Our Shared Prosperity Vision will depend very much on how well our government, industry, professional institutions and learning institutions manage the profound changes that AI and Industrial Revolution 4 will bring.

109121,Main,11,20/02/2020,Sabah begins AI for data sentencing,Judiciary sees use of technology for punishment as a progressive move,"KOTA KINABALU: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for data sentencing has begun in Sabah courts, which is seen as a progressive move by the Malaysian judiciary to use the technology as a form of aid in meting out punishment.
The initiative, which was seen as an effort to achieve parity in sentencing, is currently only deployed for two offences in Sabah and Sarawak courts – Section 12(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 for drug possession and Section 376 of the Penal Code for rape.
However, there were already “protests” as a counsel during one of the cases heard argued that the application was a breach of two Articles of the Federal Constitution.
Article 5(1) states that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with the law, while Article 8(1) said all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
Outgoing Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong Dak Wah attended the hearings of four out of 11 drug possession cases punishable under Section 12(3) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 here yesterday. Wong clocked out and officially ended his service as Chief Judge on the same day. He said such challenges against the use of the technology was something the judiciary had anticipated when introducing a new system.
“Lawyers are entitled to make objections. This is a new tool for the court; unless it is tested in court, we will not know whether it is constitutional or not.
“It is also not proper for us to say whether it is constitutional or not, as that means we will be giving our views while in office.
“We will let the objection take its course, the counsel concerned is entitled to take it further if he wants to. But when we launched it (AI for data sentencing), we expected this sort of challenge. 
“Anything new which may infringe the rule of law or the Constitution – we have to take the challenge as it comes,” he said.  
In one of the cases, counsel Ham­id Ismail represented Denis P. Modi­li, 43, who pleaded guilty to possessing 0.01g of methamphetamine. 
Hamid proposed that sentencing be carried out without looking at the AI for the particular case, saying it was a breach of the two Articles.
“The court should confine to only materials presented in court.
“AI (use) is not in accordance with the law. Although the court can choose to ignore, I am afraid it might influence the decision,” he argued, adding that the amount of drugs found on Denis was also very small and proposed the sentence be less than five months’ jail.
After noting the objection, magistrate Jessica Ombou Kakayun said the court would proceed with the AI use, which makes recommendations based on information derived from the court’s database between 2014 and 2019, and listened to arguments from both sides.
The AI proposed 10 months’ imprisonment. 
Jessica sentenced the accused to 12 months’ jail, to run concurrently from his existing sentence of eight months from the date of arrest on Dec 16 last year.
Hamid said the defence would file an appeal to the High Court as it involved constitutional matters.
“Based on today’s events, I probably may oppose it in the future,” he said in a written text reply when asked if he would be challenging the use of AI for sentencing in general outside of yesterday’s case.",kota artificial intelligence data sabah court progressive move malaysian judiciary technology form aid punishment initiative effort parity deployed offence sarawak court dangerous drug drug possession penal code rape counsel heard application breach federal constitution article person life personal liberty save law article person equal law equal protection law chief judge sabah sarawak tan sri david dak wah hearing drug possession punishable dangerous drug yesterday service chief judge day technology judiciary system lawyer objection tool court court constitutional proper constitutional view office objection counsel data sort challenge infringe rule law constitution challenge counsel ham ismail denis modi guilty methamphetamine hamid breach article court material court law court ignore afraid influence decision amount drug sentence month jail objection magistrate jessica court proceed recommendation derived court database argument month imprisonment jessica accused month sentence month dec hamid defence file appeal court constitutional matter event oppose future text reply yesterday,"[(2, 0.6382044), (4, 0.35644183)]",2
107563,Main,13,16/02/2020,Sabah judiciary to use AI,Artifical intelligence to be launched at KK Magistrate’s Court,"KOTA KINABALU: Artificial intelligence is set to make its way into Malaysian courtrooms when it is launched at a Magistrate’s Court here on Wednesday.
“It is going to be big step for the Malaysian judiciary,” Chief Judge for Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong Dak Wah said.
He said the artificial intelligence machine would recommend the likely sentence that a magistrate could give to a person found guilty of a crime.
“The use of AI will be the first in Asia. To my knowledge, no other country apart from United States uses it this way,” he said.
The full details and the standard operating procedures for such AI proceedings would be explained fully for public understanding during the launch, he said after opening the Borneo Colloquium on Environmental Justice here yesterday.
On the judicial discussion on environmental issues, he said the colloquium was to educate judges on the new areas of the law regarding environment and prepare them to hear such cases.
“There are many non-governmental organisations and lawyers who are active in this area (environment) and who are willing to take up environment cases,” he added.
He said that there was already an Environmental Court in Malaysia, which is presided by a Sessions Court judge whenever cases are heard.
The colloquium saw New Zealand’s Environment Court principal judge LJ Newhook and former Chief Justice of Malaysia Tan Sri Richard Malanjum sharing their experiences on handling environment cases.
Wong hoped that the discussions would expand the perspective on environment and ensure a more holistic approach in the administration of environmental justice.
In his speech earlier, he noted that he launched the “Wildlife Sentencing Guideline” last year in Kudat, Sabah.
“This guideline was a product of discussions between the court, the Sabah Law Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Whilst the guideline is not binding on the courts, this can be a useful guideline,” adding that it is hoped that there would be consistency in passing sentences in environmental cases.",kota artificial intelligence malaysian courtroom magistrate court wednesday step malaysian judiciary chief judge sabah sarawak tan sri david dak wah artificial intelligence machine sentence magistrate person guilty crime knowledge country detail standard operating procedure proceeding public understanding launch borneo colloquium environmental justice yesterday judicial discussion environmental issue educate judge law environment prepare hear governmental organisation lawyer active environment environment environmental court malaysia session court judge colloquium zealand environment court principal judge newhook chief justice malaysia tan sri richard malanjum experience environment wong discussion perspective environment holistic approach administration environmental justice speech guideline kudat sabah guideline product discussion court law society wide fund nature whilst guideline binding court consistency passing sentence environmental,"[(2, 0.86925256), (3, 0.123844914)]",2
102545,Main,20,31/01/2020,Setting up framework for AI in healthcare,,"GOOD health is an important prerequisite for sustainable development. It is goal number 3 in the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
But the cost to deliver 
good health continues to rise worldwide and many might not be able to afford it. This explains why health has also become an important election issue in both developed and developing countries. 
In Britain and the United States, the national health scheme has always been a contentious issue. We are fortunate that in Malaysia, the cost of delivering healthcare is still manageable.
Growing populations, demographic changes and a shortage of health practitioners are also putting pressure on the healthcare sector. At the same time, increasing amounts of digital health data and information have become available. How can we tap this vast data resource?
Artificial intelligence (AI) models are now being developed to learn from these large datasets. They offer the potential to assist with problems in medicine, for example in early detection, diagnosis and other medical decision-making. 
These advances promise to improve healthcare for patients and also provide much-needed support for medical practitioners.
Over the past decade, much investment has gone into research in the use of AI for health. Although there is immense potential, many issues, including regulation, potential for bias and adequate evaluation of efficacy, must first be addressed for safe and ethical implementation of AI in healthcare.
If the AI software is poorly designed or the data are biased or incomplete, errors can occur. So far, there is no agreed framework for assessing or reporting the results of health AI models as 
there are for development of 
new drugs.
Without such a framework, it is difficult to decide whether the AI model is sufficiently robust for wider application. Inadvertently, the absence of confidence is a major barrier to the uptake of AI 
in healthcare.
There is therefore the need to create a rigorous, standardised evaluation framework if the world is to realise the potential of this technology. Through the framework, the advantages and limitations of AI models in health can be effectively addressed. 
Responding to this need, two UN agencies, the World Health Organisation and International Telecommunication Union, have recently established a Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health, with active involvement of the German Fraunhofer Network. 
The focus group is tasked with developing a benchmarking process for health AI models that can act as an international, independent standard evaluation framework.
Since its establishment, this focus group has engaged medical, public health, AI, data analytics and policy experts to develop the framework. It is expected to develop processes for AI evaluation and specific benchmarks for each health topic. 
The AI models are also expected to offer improvements to the current practices in terms of quality and efficiency, leading to better health outcomes or cost effectiveness. 
Thus far, the focus group has developed 11 health topic groups in areas such as cardiovascular disease risk prediction, ophthalmology (retinal imaging diagnostics) and AI-based symptom checkers, but this approach is expected to be expanded to other tasks.
The benchmarking process would be done on secure and confidential test data. Ideally, the test data should originate from various sources to determine whether the use of an AI model can be generalised across different populations, measurement devices and healthcare settings.
We have been told that the benchmarking process for each use case within a topic needs to be defined. For many-use cases, it would be meaningful to compare model performance against human performance, or human performance with  AI assistance on the same task. 
Once these requirements are met, AI models can be submitted via an online platform 
to be evaluated with the test data. 
The benchmarking process would not only provide a reliable, robust and independent evaluation system that can demonstrate the quality of AI models but also an independent test dataset for model validation consistent with best practice recommendations for reporting multi-variable prediction models in health. 
The creation of a transparent process to evaluate health AI models is key to realising the potential of AI in improving human health worldwide. 
With the framework in place, there is no reason why AI cannot also be developed for the early prediction of a public health phenomenon like the Wuhan novel coronavirus which the world is now battling.

98569,Main,14,18/01/2020,AI on trial run in court,Sabah and Sarawak testing its use to determine sentences,"KUCHING: An artificial intelligence (AI) application to determine appropriate sentences for certain criminal offences will be used in a pilot project by the courts in Sabah and Sarawak.
Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong said data analysis by the AI application would serve as a guideline to judicial officers in deciding on sentences. 
He said this was aimed at improving efficiency and ensuring consistency in sentencing. 
“Every time the court passes a sentence, there are always complaints that there is disparity or inconsistency. 
“With this, hopefully, we will have consistent sentences being meted out by the court, and not one magistrate giving a fine and another giving two years’ imprisonment,” he said during a demonstration of the AI application after the opening of the legal year in Sabah and Sarawak here yesterday.
The AI pilot project will be used for two offences – drug possession under Section 12 of the Dangerous Drugs Act and rape under Section 376 of the Penal Code.
The application will analyse data for these offences gathered from cases registered in Sabah and Sarawak from 2014 to 2019. 
It will also analyse relevant information and parameters, such as the age of the accused, type and weight of drugs in cases of drug possession or age of victim and whether hurt was caused in rape offences, to come up with a recommended sentence.
Wong said the judiciary was now in the process of creating ground rules for the use of the application, including making known to the accused and their lawyers what the likely sentences would be if they chose to plead guilty.
He said the rules should be ready in a week or so.
Chief Justice Tan Sri Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat said it was timely for the judiciary to move along with technological advancement.
“I don’t see a reason why we should not embark on this. But of course we cannot rely 100% on technology, so there must be a human element as well.
“This is a pilot project and as we go along, we’ll see how it needs to be improved or otherwise,” she said.
Currently, courts and corrections departments around the United States use algorithms to determine a defendant’s “risk”, which ranges from the probability that an individual will commit another crime to the likelihood a defendant will appear for his or her court date.

 The AI Powered Equity (AIEQ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) sold down its so-called FANG+ positions this month, leaving just Apple Inc in its top 20 holdings, according to the latest filings.
 On Dec 1, Microsoft Corp was the ETF’s number one position with Google parent Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc in third and fourth place, respectively.
 The fund has lagged its benchmark, the S&P 500 Total Return Index, by 9 percentage points this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 “AIEQ continues to lighten up on its Big Tech exposure, with none in its top 10 positions,” said Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research. 
 “The only overlapping theme in its top 10 positions is cybersecurity, with the rest spanning everything from cloud computing and commercial real estate to medical devices and the semiconductor industry.”

 SenseTime plans to offer 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 (RM2.08) apiece, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public yet. 
 At that price, it would raise about HK$5.78bil (US$741mil or RM3.12bil). The company had marketed the shares at HK$3.85 (RM2.08) to HK$3.99 (RM2.15) each, with trading debut set for Dec 30.
 No final decision has been reached and details may still change, the people said. A representative for SenseTime didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours in Hong Kong.
 The AI startup reopened orders on Dec 20 for its first-time share sale after a move by the United States Treasury Department to sanction the company derailed the original schedule.

361930,Main,20,14/12/2021,Seoul to test facial recognition AI on virus patients,,"SEOUL: South Korea will soon roll out a pilot project to use artificial intelligence, facial recognition and thousands of CCTV cameras to track the movement of people infected with the coronavirus, despite concerns about the invasion of privacy.
 The nationally funded project in Bucheon, one of the country’s most densely populated cities on the outskirts of Seoul, is due to become operational in January, a city official said.
 The system uses an AI algorithms and facial recognition technology to analyse footage gathered by more than 10,820 CCTV cameras and track an infected person’s movements, anyone they had close contact with, and whether they were wearing a mask, according to a 110-page business plan from the city submitted to the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communications Tech­nology), and provided by a parliamentary lawmaker critical of the project.
 The Bucheon official said the system should reduce the strain on overworked tracing teams in a city with a population of more than 800,000 people, and help use the teams more efficiently and accurately.
 While there has been wide public support for existing invasive track and trace methods, human rights advocates and some South Korean lawmakers have expressed concerns that the government will retain and harness such data far beyond the needs of the pandemic.
 Meanwhile, the Omicron coronavirus variant is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms according to early data, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday.
 The WHO said Omicron had spread to 63 countries as of Dec 9. Faster transmission was noted in South Africa, where Delta is less prevalent, and in Britain, where Delta is the dominant strain.

360822,StarBiz 7,2,11/12/2021,AI and healthcare plans at the heart of G3 Global,Bestinet founder takes over helm of company,"G3 GLOBAL Bhd is morphing into a provider of technology-based healthcare solutions, says its new major shareholder and executive director Datuk Seri Aminul Islam Abdul Nor (better known as Datuk Seri Mohd Amin). 
 “We want to focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and other information technology-based healthcare solutions. 
 “Especially with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare has taken centre stage. This new focus is a natural extension of our biomedical solutions,” Mohd Amin tells StarBizWeek via email replies to questions. Mohd Amin was appointed an executive director of G3 Global two weeks ago, after he emerged in the company with a 25% stake. 
 In corporate circles he is known as being the founder and chairman of technology firm Bestinet Sdn Bhd, which provides information technology solutions for managing foreign labour for all stakeholders.
 G3 Global had said that Mohd Amin had initiated the Foreign Workers Centralised Management System (FWCMS) for the Malaysian government, an end-to-end platform that connects all stakeholders in the migrant workers management such as employers, recruitment agents in Malaysia and resource countries, governments and medical centres.
 On Sept 8, G3 Global acquired a 51% stake in Bestinet Healthcare Sdn Bhd, which distributes hospital and pharmaceutical products that include rapid test kits for Covid-19, canulas, syringes and needles, among others.
 This week, G3 Global announced in a filing with the stock exchange that it intends to seek shareholder approval for a diversification of business into the healthcare sector related business, which includes the distribution of Covid-19 test kits and that this is being done via its acquisition of Bestinet Healthcare. 
 The filing revealed that Bestinet Healthcare has already secured revenue of RM2.6mil from the sale of antigen test kits since starting the business just four months ago. 
 It says that the plan is to source Covid-19 test kits from local manufacturers approved by the Medical Device Authority (MDA) and that Bestinet Healthcare has secured a distributor licence from MDA to undertake the distribution of such kits. 
 G3 Global said that the test kit market in Malaysia has grown from 1.1 million tests in 2020 to 21.5 million tests in 2021 and will hit 25 million tests in 2022. 
 Mohd Amin hints that G3 Global’s healthcare business will move beyond just the sale of test kits. 
 “The potential use for artificiall intelligence (AI) in healthcare is vast. One niche we are looking at is in the area of healthcare diagnosis,” says Mohd Amin.
 AI has been meant to be a theme for G3 Global for some time. Recall that back in 2019, G3 Global had inked a memorandum of understanding with SenseTime Group Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd to set up the first AI park in Malaysia. The three parties were to invest around US$1bil (RM4.22bil) in the project. However, there has been little development of the project since then. 
 Addressing the issue, Dirk Quinten, the managing director of G3 Global said the company had participated in the request for proposal for the development of the desired land area for the AI park and received a letter of intent in Oct 2020.
 “We have been working on the development of concepts, layouts, masterplans, foreign direct investment schemes, preferred technologies, partnerships and content among other things. 
 “This is a massive project that involves our inhouse team as well as local and international consultants, architects and developers. Term sheets with clients and partners are under discussion,” says Quinten.
 He adds that progress has been steady but projects of such scale require time to consider and consolidate the wishes, needs, variables of the many stakeholders involved. 
 “In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic is not creating a conducive environment for such a project, but things are still moving. Notably, the AI park is something that we think the country urgently needs and G3 Global is confident of ground-breaking in the near future,” he adds. 
 Quinten, who was made managing director in July last year explains that since assuming the position, the company has been undertaking various measures to put it on a better financial footing. 
 They include streamlining operations, reducing operating expenditure and improving the company’s cash position. 
 He notes that AI adoption rate in Malaysia is still very low. 
 However, large scale or high-end AI solutions require robust infrastructure, regulatory policies and other ingredients currently often unavailable nationwide, he points out. 
 On its part, he adds that G3 Global does not only provide high-end AI solutions but “also strives to be the partner to government agencies and policy makers in creating the blueprints for sustainable AI development in all verticals as detailed in the published national AI Roadmap”.
 Meanwhile, Mohd Amin hopes to bring more value to the company, leveraging on his expertise in mega IT developments and projects.
 “For example, we want to make the FWCMS modules available. 
 “G3 has many fantastic AI products and solutions which need to be embedded in IT infrastructure and ecosystem to maximise functionality and usability,” he says. 
 In explaining his past experience as a businessman, Mohd Amin says that he had built FWCMS to bring about transparency and efficiency in the management of human resources. 
 “After the number of years I have been in the business, I realised many challenges and issues in the human resource industry and the only way to resolve these issues was through technology to improve the business process and making them transparent for all stakeholders involved. 
 “This is where I came up with the FWCMS system, which was the first in the world bringing together all stakeholders into one single system to eliminate the leakages,” Mohd Amin says.  
 According to him, some of these challenges (in the human resources sector) include employers taking a long time for visa approvals, workers failing the medical tests, impersonation, forged medical reports and forged or no insurance coverage for the workers.  
 Eventually, Mohd Amin says that he plans to expand the business at G3 Global to South-East Asia and the Middle East.
 For the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2021, the company made a net loss of RM2.79mil as compared to a RM1.96mil net loss in the same period a year ago.

 They are among thousands of Russians who have faced court over their social media posts in the past year – a number digital rights groups say could soon turn into a deluge as authorities use artificial intelligence (AI) to police the Web.
 “We expect that all content posted on social media (in Russia) will be monitored by automated software,” said Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department for digital rights group Roskomsvoboda.
 “This will be particularly bad for young people who will have red flags put on (them), and be prosecuted and fined for posting different material,” he said by phone.
 Russia has passed an array of legislation in recent years to boost what it calls its Internet “sovereignty” and tighten control over cyberspace.
 The increasing scrutiny of what people say online is part of a wider drive that has seen Moscow pressuring foreign tech firms such as Twitter and Facebook to delete content it deems illegal and blocking opposition sites and news outlets.
 While the search for banned material used to be down to police or pro-government activists, authorities are turning to AI tools to quickly wade through millions of posts per day.
 Authorities say the monitoring systems are meant to tackle crime, but rights groups fear that they will be used to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech.
 “We are seeing a pincer attack by governments across the world with draconian laws that attack freedom of expression and privacy online,” said Likhita Banerji, a technology and human rights researcher at Amnesty International.

 Constant monitoring
 Since 2017, the Perm-based tech firm Seuslab has been supplying law enforcement in dozens of regions with software that its director Evgeny Rabchevsky said can process a billion social networking pages and instant messaging chats a day.
 He said police use the tool to detect and prevent crimes including terrorism, child pornography, drug-related offences and “destructive subcultures” – a term he said referred to issues like “child suicide propaganda” and calls for violence.
 “Authorities use the product to assess social tensions, identify problematic issues of interest ... (and) adjust their activities,” he said, adding that the firm recently developed an AI tool to monitor social media activity during protests. 
 In October, the Center for the Study and Network Monitoring of the Youth Environment, an NGO founded on behalf of Putin, said it had developed an AI tool to scan social media for what it considered socially dangerous and destructive content.
 The tool was created under a scheme run by youth affairs agency Rosmolodyozh, which did not respond to requests for comment.
 Instead, the spokesperson pointed to an interview in Forbes Russia magazine in which the head of the NGO, Denis Zavarzin, said its system was “constantly monitoring” about 1.5 million accounts. 
 Research shows more Russian AI cyber-monitors are in the making.
 Official documents seen by Reuters in September show that authorities are developing a new monitoring system that will automatically search for banned content on social networks and the messaging app Telegram.
 And tenders are also planned for two more tools, one to search for visual information and the other to defend against information threats.All three systems are expected to be up and running next year, as draft budget proposals released in September showed Russia may spend 31bil roubles (RM1.76bil) on enhancing its Internet infrastructure in 2022 to 2024.
 Penalties aplenty 
 In Russia, there is no shortage of laws netizens can fall foul of.
 In 2019, the country imposed new fines of up to 100,000 roubles (RM5,700) on people who spread what the authorities regard as fake news or show “blatant disrespect” for the state.
 Court documents seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation show Seuslab’s tool was used that year to bring extremism charges against a woman for a blasphemous social media post.
 Activists and others have landed in hot water for posts related to what the government considers “extremist” organisations, including the Jehovah’s Witnesses religious group and groups linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
 Damir Gainutdinov, a lawyer who heads the Net Freedoms Project run by human rights group Agora, said last year journalists and bloggers received more than 1,000 fines for online speech violations.
 Gainutdinov believes the fines came from an automated system.
 “Even the text of the notice is always the same, it’s copied and pasted over and over,” he said.
 According to Agora, more than 22,000 administrative cases have been initiated since 2017, which include displaying prohibited symbols and disseminating extremist material, with cases nearing a record 7,000 in 2021 alone.
 Andrey Shabanov, a saxophonist from the city of Samara, is facing charges including rehabilitating Nazism and disrespecting Russia’s military for a series of posts criticising celebrations of the Soviet victory in World War Two.In May last year, he allegedly decried Soviet totalitarianism on VKontakte, a Russian social media site, and said an annual parade in which people march with portraits of relatives who fought in the war was “idiotic”.
 The 40-year-old musician also uploaded a photo of Adolf Hitler to a website dedicated to the parade, in a move his lawyer Aleksei Lapuzin said aimed to draw attention to what Shabanov saw as “the growth of fascism in Russia”.
 Lapuzin, whose client faces a maximum of three years in jail, said the case was emblematic of the shrinking space for online free speech in the country.
 Darbinyan of Roskomsvoboda said the deployment of AI vigilantes was all the more concerning with no adequate legal framework for digital rights in place and the government bent on “clearing Russian cyberspace of all undesirable content”.
 Earlier this year, Putin called for the Internet to be bound by moral rules to stop society fraying and railed against what he said was its role in drawing children into opposition street protests, prostitution and drugs.
 Shabanov, the saxophonist, said he refrained from posting on social media for a while after his case was initiated, but has now returned to his usual online habits, even though the case is still being heard.“I don’t think words should be something you should be prosecuted for,” he said via WhatsApp. 
 “Words or stupid actions are not a crime.”
 Others are more cautious.
 Some rights activists have urged Internet users to delete old posts – or stay off social media altogether.
 “We do not recommend our supporters use Russian social networks in general. We do not consider them safe,” said Mikhail Klimarev, director of the Internet Protection Society, a privacy group.
 “We are in a cyberwar, with many people in prison and others persecuted for their words on the Internet. Self-censorship is becoming more and more common practice.

358781,StarEdu,7,05/12/2021,AI: A new way to solve problems,,"IN 2016, AlphaGo, a Go-playing computer programme developed by Google DeepMind, beat 18-time Go world champion human player, Lee Sedol, in four out of five games. 
 The match put artificial intelligence (AI) advancement in the limelight and received attention beyond academia although this was not the first time a computer programme won in a man-against-machine competition. 
 In 1997, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue, a supercomputer developed by IBM. The competition was the first game ever recorded in which a computer software defeated an expert player under tournament regulations.
 Although both matches appear similar, the underlying AI techniques are two decades apart. 
 Deep Blue uses good, old-fashioned AI, which requires the programmer to present the problem in a way that the computer can compute. In other words, the AI programme is only as good as the chess knowledge programmed by the programmer.
 On the contrary, AlphaGo uses machine learning approach, specifically deep reinforcement learning, which is capable of learning the game from watching and playing the game against human and also itself, repetitively. 
 AlphaGo was then succeeded by AlphaGo Zero, which was capable of learning the game starting from zero by playing against itself without any human data.
 The emergence of these AI techniques means that AI is no longer bound by the limits of the human programmer. 
 AlphaGo Zero took only three days to learn the game from scratch and beat its predecessor, AlphaGo, in all 100 games.
 When AI can be trained to perform tasks better than humans, some begin to worry that mankind is facing existential risk against AI, possibly due to the influence of science fiction movies. 
 Such human-like level of AI is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) but many AI applications that we have today do not have any form of consciousness and are only designed to perform a single task.
 Many of these AI applications are already in our smartphones and living environment. 
 Some of the more commonly used AI applications are the unlock phone function which uses face recognition technology, and the voice command function which activates certain phone functions through verbal commands. On a larger scale, AI is used by organisations for surveillance, elevator group control, and building access control.
 Although some of these applications have been around for ages, the advancement of AI has made these applications more effective and efficient over the years. 
 For instance, the speech recognition of yesteryears that used AI would never be able to handle the speed and slang evident in speeches and conversations of today. 
 If you have your smartphone with you, you can try out the speech recognition function by saying “Ok Google” for Android phone and “Hey Siri” for iPhone without the need to follow the intonation of a native English speaker. That’s how smart the AI is today.
 The use of AI is no longer limited to prototypes in laboratory and non-mission-critical applications. 
 Over the years, due to the breakthrough in AI techniques and computing hardware, such as the deep learning algorithm and computers with built-in AI processors, AI performance has now reached a level where it is usable in critical applications such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.
 One notable example in transportation is the self-driving vehicle. A self-driving vehicle uses AI to perceive its surroundings, anticipate the speed and direction of incoming vehicles to avoid collision, and at the same time actuate the controls of the car to navigate safely to its destination. 
 In healthcare, Google DeepMind created AlphaFold, an AI programme that can predict the structure of proteins at an unprecedented accuracy and speed. This has helped scientists to better understand the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
 Similarly, in finance, AI is deployed to assess credit risks which does not only mitigate financial risk, but also performs credit risk assessment much faster. It is also believed that the latest AI technology can evaluate a loan application, which normally takes days to complete, in mere minutes.
 There are many other AI applications that users are unaware of. For instance, in telecommunications, AI is used to monitor cellular network resources and overcome problems before user experience is impacted.
 The use of AI has become indispensable in our daily lives. The list of AI applications will continue to grow and revolutionise the way problems are solved.ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

356917,Lifestyle,3,29/11/2021,AI surveillance takes US prisons by storm,,"WHEN the sheriff in Suffolk County, New York, United States, requested US$700,000 (RM2.9mil) from the US government for an artificial intelligence (AI) system to eavesdrop on prison phone conversations, his office called it a key tool in fighting gang-related and violent crime.
 But the county jail ended up listening to calls involving a much wider range of subjects – scanning as many as 600,000 minutes per month, according to public records from the county obtained by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 Beginning in 2019, Suffolk County was an early pilot site for the Verus AI-scanning system sold by California-based Leo Technologies, which uses Amazon speech-to-text technology to transcribe phone calls flagged by keyword searches.
 The company and law enforcement officials say it is a crucial tool to keep prisons and jails safe, and fight crime, but critics say such systems trample the privacy rights of prisoners and other people, like family members, on the outside.
 “T​​he ability to surveil and listen at scale in this rapid way – it is incredibly scary and chilling,” said Julie Mao, deputy director at Just Futures Law, an immigration legal group.
 Suffolk County is among dozens of county jails and state prisons in seven US states, including major metro areas such as Houston, Texas, and Birmingham, Alabama, that Leo says have so far implemented the Verus system to monitor inmates’ calls.Undersheriff Kevin Catalina, who helped run the programme in Suffolk County, said the system “unquestionably benefits public safety, and the safety of staff and inmates”.
 Emails and contracts from eight US states show the tool is used to scan a wide range of calls, for example conversations involving mention of the Spanish word for lawyer or accusations that detention facilities were covering up Covid-19 outbreaks.
 In Suffolk County, emails from the sheriff’s office show officials sometimes searched for words with multiple or benign meanings such as “mara”, which can mean gang or simply a group of friends.
 Sheriff’s deputies in Suffolk County also circulated a regular intelligence brief of prisoners the system flagged for illegally collecting unemployment benefits while in the jail.
 A series of court rulings have given US authorities wide scope to use surveillance of prisoners’ conversations as long as they are working to ensure safety and fight crime.
 “All county inmates are notified that their phone calls are monitored,” Catalina said.
 Leo, which declined to comment, says on its website that Verus is an “objective” way to flag threats to incarcerated people, “disrupt criminal operations within correctional facilities and assist ongoing investigations with critical evidence”.
 Innocent people
 The company is one of several that are offering or working to provide surveillance services, including the two main firms that already provide the infrastructure for prison phone calls, Securus and GTL, both of which market monitoring services.
 “We are committed to protecting the civil liberties of all those who use our products,” a spokesperson for Securus said in a written statement.
 GTL declined to comment when asked whether it was still proceeding with the technology and what safeguards were in place.
 Leo advertises Verus as the most advanced system on the market.
 In documents obtained through a records request to the Missouri Department of Corrections, it is described as unique among competitors in offering near-real-time analysis and actionable reports.
 It is also hailed as a means to help law enforcement identify gang members by flagging “patterns of behaviour among inmates and their associates”.
 Instead of trawling through hours of recorded calls, Catalina said the system “allows staff to be more efficient with their time by honing in on keywords that meet specific objectives”.
 But using Verus to link people on prison phone calls to gang activity risks sweeping in innocent people, too, said Beryl Lipton, a researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) who investigates prison surveillance systems.
 “There’s often no way to figure out if you’re on that kind of list, and how to get off it,” she said, adding that law enforcement in Suffolk County had a history of erroneously labelling Latino men as gang members.
 Suffolk County did not respond to a request for comment on Lipton’s criticism.
 ‘Stretch the limit’
 Intelligence gleaned from the Verus system is already shared with current and potential Leo clients around the United States, and more than two dozen law enforcement and immigration agencies and divisions, according to documents from Suffolk County.
 At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Leo – in partnership with prison authorities – expanded its focus to monitoring telephone conversations about the virus in detention facilities, documents show.
 A data table circulated by the company to clients showed it had flagged thousands of calls based on keywords including “cough” and “infection” between March and June in 2020, highlighting its role in containing outbreaks among prisoners.
 The technology was not just used to detect possible Covid-19 outbreaks, however.
 In Calhoun County, Alabama, prison authorities used Verus to identify phone calls in which prisoners vouched for the cleanliness of the facility, looking for potential ammunition to fight lawsuits, email records show.As part of an emailed sales pitch to the jail in Cook County, Illinois, Leo’s chief operating officer, James Sexton, highlighted the Alabama case as an example of the system’s potential uses.
 “(The) sheriff believes (the calls) will help him fend off pending liability via civil action from inmates and activists,” he wrote.
 A spokesman for Cook County said it had explored a pilot with Leo to help identify instances of “self-harm” in its facilities, but decided the technology was too expensive.
 Prisons are allowed to undertake surveillance related to “legitimate penological goals”, said Stephanie Krent, staff  attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Public records show Verus is routinely deployed, for example, to identify inmates who might be contemplating self-harm or suicide, or find murderers and rapists inside and outside of correctional facilities.
 But Krent said surveillance operations like the one carried out in Alabama “really stretched the limit”.
 During a similar operation in Suffolk County, the Verus system flagged a phone call in which an inmate tells his father the jail is covering up a Covid-19 outbreak, and discusses contacting the media.
 An official report about the phone call was shared with nearly a dozen prison staff members and Leo employees, documents from Suffolk show.
 Such incidents demonstrate how AI-powered surveillance tools can be used to identify prisoners who speak out against abuse or want to become whistleblowers, Krent said.
 “Protecting the interest and reputations of the people who run the jail is not a legitimate goal,” Krent said after reviewing the emails.
 ‘Avalanche effect’
 And despite the emphasis on gang activity and serious crime, emails from New York show authorities have begun using Verus to get leads on more minor offences – from using contraband cellphones to benefit fraud.
 Earlier this year, Texas awarded a contract to Leo to work with facilities dealing with a recent surge in migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, after the governor declared a state of emergency.
 “You can see how the justification changes over time,” said Daniel Schwarz, a technologist with the New York Civil Liberties Union who reviewed some of the documents.
 In Suffolk County alone, Verus was used to monitor more than 2.5 million phone calls between its implementation in April 2019 and May 2020 – leading to 96 “actionable intelligence reports”, according to county documents.
 “This technology has detected and prevented inmate suicides, uncovered human trafficking, and prevented and solved violent crimes,” Catalina said.
 But Krent said it was not clear whether the 96 reports justified sweeping up several million phone calls.“There’s an avalanche effect. Once a technology like this is implemented it’s hard to let it go,” she said.
 With prisons around the United States rolling out more advanced surveillance systems, Schwartz said limitations must be put in place.
 “We need to think about what happens to people when the only communication they have with their families and loved ones comes with a big surveillance target on their backs,” he said. – Thomson Reuters Foundation",sheriff suffolk county york united mil government artificial intelligence system prison phone conversation office key tool gang violent crime county jail call wider range subject minute month public record county thomson reuters suffolk county pilot site verus system california leo technology speech text technology phone call keyword search company law enforcement official crucial tool prison safe fight crime critic system trample privacy right prisoner people family ability scale rapid scary julie deputy director future law immigration legal suffolk county dozen jail prison major metro houston texas birmingham alabama leo verus system monitor undersheriff kevin catalina suffolk county system unquestionably benefit public safety safety staff email contract scan wide range conversation mention spanish word lawyer accusation detention facility covid outbreak county email sheriff office official multiple benign meaning mara gang sheriff deputy county regular intelligence prisoner system unemployment benefit jail series court ruling authority wide scope surveillance prisoner conversation safety fight crime county inmate phone call catalina leo comment verus objective flag threat people disrupt criminal operation correctional facility ongoing investigation critical evidence innocent people company provide surveillance service main firm infrastructure prison phone securus gtl market monitoring service civil liberty product spokesperson securus statement gtl comment technology safeguard advertises advanced system market document record missouri department correction unique competitor real time analysis actionable report law enforcement gang pattern behaviour inmate associate hour call catalina system staff efficient time keywords specific objective verus people phone call gang activity risk sweeping innocent people researcher electronic frontier foundation eff prison surveillance system figure list law enforcement suffolk county history latino gang county respond request comment lipton criticism stretch limit intelligence verus system current potential leo client united dozen law enforcement immigration agency division document county height pandemic leo partnership prison authority focus telephone conversation detention facility document data table company client thousand call keywords cough infection march june role outbreak prisoner technology covid outbreak county alabama prison authority phone prisoner cleanliness facility potential ammunition fight lawsuit record sale pitch jail cook county illinois chief officer james alabama system potential sheriff fend liability civil action inmate activist spokesman cook county pilot leo identify instance harm facility technology expensive prison undertake surveillance legitimate penological goal krent staff attorney knight amendment institute columbia university public record identify harm suicide murderer rapist correctional facility surveillance operation alabama stretched limit operation county verus system phone call inmate jail covid outbreak medium official report phone call dozen prison staff leo employee document suffolk incident surveillance tool prisoner whistleblower reputation people legitimate goal krent email emphasis gang activity crime york authority verus lead minor offence cellphone fraud texas contract leo facility surge migrant mexico border governor emergency justification time daniel schwarz technologist york civil liberty union document suffolk county verus monitor phone implementation actionable intelligence report county document technology prevented inmate suicide uncovered human trafficking solved violent crime krent report phone call technology hard prison advanced surveillance system schwartz limitation people communication family surveillance target thomson reuters,"[(5, 0.998162)]",5
354731,Lifestyle,3,22/11/2021,Gulf nations bet big on AI,,"Robots puttering around Dubai’s hi-tech Expo site could be a sign of things to come for the Gulf, where new cities are being built from scratch with artificial intelligence (AI) at their core.
 The 5G-enabled Expo, covering an area twice the size of Monaco, will remain as a “city of the future” and tech industry hub, the Expo’s chief said before its grand opening last month.
 But the US$7bil (RM29.2bil) project, featuring robots that greet visitors and can be used to order food, is not alone in the wealthy Gulf, where petro-dollars are being invested heavily in a post-oil future.
 Neighbouring Saudi Arabia is lavishing US$500bil (RM2.08 trillion) on Neom, a brand new, next- generation Red Sea tech centre that will offer ultra-connectivity to its planned population of one million-plus, and is trialling airborne taxis.
 AI is also at the heart of other Saudi developments including the Red Sea Project, a new tourist area that will use smart systems to monitor environmental impacts and visitor movements.
 Analysts say the Gulf monarchies are willing to bet big on AI, knowing they must move away from their reliance on fossil fuel industries and become more active in tech, tourism and other areas.
 “You’ve got very forward (-looking), somewhat risk-loving leadership that sees the need to transform,” said Kaveh Vessali, a partner at consultancy firm PwC Middle East.
 “I think that’s just completely the opposite of what I see in the rest of the world.”
 Pedal to the metal
 AI courses in Bahrain primary schools, the UAE’s plans for automated delivery drones, and Dubai’s ambition to have 25% of all transport automated by 2030 offer further evidence of the Gulf’s tech aspirations.
 The Middle East is predicted to receive only 2% of the estimated US$15.7 trillion (RM65.5 trillion) global AI economy by 2030, according to PwC.But analysts say the Gulf countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE – are playing the long game, positioning themselves to leapfrog global players.
 The annual growth rate of the Middle East AI market is about 20% to 34%, led by the UAE and then Saudi Arabia, PwC said in a report, predicting that more than 10% of each of the two countries’ GDP will come from AI by 2030.
 “Governments have the luxury of being more strategic,” said Vessali, citing the 20 and 50-year plans which are a hallmark of Gulf governments.
 “This is unheard of a: in the private sector, and b: in the West,” he adds.
 Vessali said most AI companies in Gulf states are fully, or at least semi-governmental, with comparatively low pressure to generate short-term returns.
 However, the region has a history of investing in companies which did not become particularly profitable, outside a few core industries such as oil and gas, he warned.
 ‘Streamlined’ decision-makingWhile the region might be known as culturally conservative, its AI strategies are better characterised as liberal and aggressive, according to some local players.
 In 2017, the UAE appointed its first minister of state for AI, Omar bin Sultan al-Olama, to spearhead the country’s AI strategy, launched that same year.
 The UAE has said it aims to become one of the leading nations in AI by 2031, creating new economic and business opportunities, and generate up to 335 billion dirhams (RM381bil) in extra growth.
 “The region seems to classify being left behind on new technologies as a bigger risk than anything else,” said Cesar Lopez, the CEO of Datumcon.
 “Taking the risk to do what others aren’t has attracted and built business,” he said.
 The data and AI solutions company based in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is using computer vision to scan and identify damaged containers at Jebel Ali port in Dubai, one of the world’s busiest, operated by logistics company DP World.
 But despite the Gulf’s AI investments, the lack of reliable and accessible data sets, which are at the core of these systems, remain a barrier.
 “It’s going to take a few years to get there because the data isn’t mature enough for it yet (in the region),” said Stephen Rawson, an associate at American consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
 While Gulf countries have been better at centralising data across different governmental platforms, other leading countries have managed better data sets for longer.
 But being newer to data collection has its advantages, said Rawson, as Gulf countries can generate cleaner data to create more streamlined AI systems.
 “They are empowered to do this more than they would be in the West,” said Rawson, because with private enterprises, “getting them to work and play nice will only work if there’s a profit margin incentive for all of them.” – AFP",robot dubai tech expo site sign gulf city artificial intelligence core expo size monaco city future tech industry hub chief grand month bil project robot greet visitor food wealthy gulf petro dollar oil future saudi arabia bil neom brand generation sea tech centre ultra connectivity population airborne taxi heart saudi development red sea project tourist smart system environmental impact visitor movement analyst monarchy move reliance fossil fuel industry active tech tourism risk leadership transform kaveh vessali partner consultancy firm pwc east opposite rest pedal metal course primary school uae plan delivery drone ambition transport offer evidence gulf tech aspiration predicted receive global economy pwc analyst country kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia uae playing game leapfrog global player annual growth rate east market uae saudi arabia pwc report country government luxury strategic vessali plan hallmark gulf government unheard private sector west vessali company semi governmental low pressure generate short term return region history company profitable core industry oil gas streamlined decision makingwhile region conservative strategy liberal aggressive local player minister omar bin sultan spearhead country strategy aim nation economic business opportunity dirham bil extra growth region classify technology bigger risk cesar lopez ceo datumcon risk built business data solution company uae saudi arabia computer vision scan identify container ali port dubai busiest logistics company gulf investment reliable accessible data set system barrier data region stephen rawson associate american consulting firm wyman gulf country data governmental platform country data set data collection advantage gulf country cleaner data create system west rawson private enterprise nice profit margin incentive afp,"[(0, 0.99627405)]",0
351713,Lifestyle,4,15/11/2021,Accelerating AI adoption,Five ways artificial intelligence could shape our lives in the future.,"TECH evangelists habitually brim with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) potential to transform our lives, and the crowds at this year’s Web Summit international conference were no exception.
 Here are five uses for AI showcased at one of the world’s largest technology conferences, which returned to Lisbon, Portugal after the 2020 edition was called off due to the pandemic.
 1 Heart health
 When Iker Casillas learned of a startup that uses AI to better detect irregular heart rhythms, he swiftly signed up as an investor.
 The Spanish football legend had suffered a heart attack in 2019, putting a brutal end to his career.
 Madrid-based company Idoven analyses data from home heart monitoring kits to track people’s cardiac health – and crucially, to flag up looming problems.
 “We are the first company in the world capable of doing it,” its CEO Manuel Marina-Breysse said.
 AI is also being used by a growing number of mental health startups.
 Woebot, a chatbot which people can use to unburden their anxieties, adapts its responses based on an AI-informed reading of the person’s emotional state.
 “If somebody is in distress or they’re really not feeling great, Woebot will invite them to work on it, or just get it off their chest,” explained its founder Alison Darcy, a clinical research psychologist.
 Some may find the idea of pouring one’s heart out to a chatbot unnerving, but the Silicon Valley startup points to studies suggesting that people sometimes prefer confiding in a non-judgmental robot.2 Reducing waste
 AI doesn’t represent a straightforward win for the climate.
 Training a single algorithm system can use nearly five times the emissions produced by a car over its lifetime, according to University of Massachusetts researchers.
 But AI is also making a wide range of industrial processes more efficient, from cement production to cooling data centres.
 It could also be used to reduce the amount of garbage we send to landfills.
 British startup Greyparrot uses AI to recognise different types of waste moving down a conveyor belt, picking out recyclables from plastic to glass better than the machines typically used at the moment.

 Could AI stop road accidents? Irish startup Provizio is developing technology that uses machine learning to analyse data from sensors attached to a car.
 In time, its founder Barry Lunn hopes that will allow emergency braking systems to kick into gear 10 times faster than previously.
 4 Code writing
 The age of AI shunning all need for human help, and writing its own computer code, is closer than you may think.
 One initiative generating a buzz in Lisbon was Copilot, a joint project by software development platform GitHub and research lab OpenAI.
 The tool can auto- complete chunks of code, understanding the intentions of the human software engineer.
 But New York University researchers suggest the computers still need us: around 40% of the time, the code still has bugs in it.
 5 Deepfakes for fun 
 Recent years have seen growing alarm over deepfake technology, in which stunningly realistic likenesses of living people can be made to act as the creator pleases.
 Deepfakes appearing to show actor Tom Cruise went viral this year, prompting fresh questions over whether the technology could be used for fraud or even political manipulation.
 Reface, a US startup founded by Ukrainians, wants to use deepfake AI for more playful purposes, allowing the user to swap Justin Bieber’s head, or the Mona Lisa’s, for their own.
 But co-founder Ivan Altsybieiev imagines a future where people could mock up entire remakes of their favourite TV shows, starring themselves.
 A “future where all content could be personalised”, he said. – AFP",tech brim enthusiasm artificial intelligence potential transform crowd web summit international conference exception largest technology conference lisbon portugal edition pandemic heart health iker casillas startup detect irregular heart investor spanish football legend heart attack brutal career madrid company idoven analysis data heart monitoring track people health company capable ceo manuel marina breysse mental health startup chatbot people unburden anxiety response informed person emotional distress woebot invite chest founder alison clinical psychologist idea heart chatbot silicon valley startup study people judgmental robot waste represent straightforward climate training single algorithm system time emission car lifetime university massachusetts researcher wide range industrial efficient cement production data centre amount garbage landfill british startup greyparrot recognise type conveyor recyclables plastic glass machine moment safer street road accident irish startup provizio technology machine analyse data sensor car time founder barry emergency system kick gear time code age human computer code initiative buzz lisbon copilot joint project software development platform github lab tool auto complete chunk understanding intention human software engineer york university researcher computer time code bug deepfakes alarm deepfake technology realistic likeness people plea deepfakes actor tom cruise viral fresh question technology fraud political manipulation reface startup ukrainian playful purpose user swap justin head mona lisa founder ivan altsybieiev future people entire remake favourite future content afp,"[(0, 0.995779)]",0
351447,StarEdu,8,14/11/2021,AI: Chaos without control,Ensure development of human-programmed systems not abused,"WILL artificial intelligence (AI) take over my job? Will it take over the world? 
 Like most, if not all, upper secondary school students, I’m facing the dilemma of picking a university and a career I want to go into. 
 When I first began searching for possible careers, I looked up “careers that AI will not take over”. 
 With AI being such a new phenomenon, it is not surprising that we may feel threatened by its existence. But is AI really a threat?
 Known as a computerised system that is programmed to think like humans, AI is able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. 
 These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, problem-solving, decision-making, and translation between languages. 
 AI can analyse sales calls, input and analyse values much faster than any human could, thus it has already begun to replace the jobs of telemarketers, bookkeeping clerks and receptionists, for instance. 
 At the speed at which it is currently progressing, it is likely that AI will continue to take over jobs that can be automated.
 In order to understand the future of AI, we have to travel back a few centuries when machines were first popularised. 
 Back then, people feared the large, foreign machines would take away jobs, such as factory work, cloth making and automobile manufacturing. 
 Now, it’s hard to imagine manufacturing without machinery. 
 In addition, many factory goods are now cheaper for consumers without having to exploit human labour. 
 And when computers were first popularised 20 years ago, people too feared that these digital devices would take away jobs. 
 While they have indeed taken away or reduced some jobs, such as those of cashiers, bank tellers and phone operators, people with these jobs have learned to work alongside computers. 
 For example, some of these bank tellers now work in cybersecurity to minimise the risk of Internet banking scams. 
 The jobs that computers have created certainly outweigh the ones they have taken away. 
 Some social media influencers earn more than the average doctor, which has traditionally been considered the “highest-paying” job. 
 The Third Industrial Revolution and the development of computers have undeniably opened us to a whole new world of possibilities, and proven that we humans are able to adapt to new technological developments. 
 Who’s to say that AI won’t do the same for us? 
 But jobs are only an aspect of life. What about the world? Will AI destroy humanity accidentally, if not intentionally? 
 The TV show The 100 offers an interesting take on what the world would be like if an AI robot wanted to destroy humanity. 
 Although created with good intentions, the female robot overpowered its creator. She realised that the world faced the problem of overpopulation and couldn’t cater for everyone in the world, thus deciding to start huge fires in order to reduce the population. 
 It may just be fiction, but it is a valid concern. 
 With billions of dollars being channelled into AI research, there should be more regulations regarding the development of new AI to ensure that it is not abused.
 In conclusion, there is a real threat that AI could lead the world into chaos. With every new piece of technology comes the threat of malfunction or misuse, and AI is no different. 
 AI can bring us wonderful things, such as providing solutions to climate change, preventing or even curing illnesses, and improving the efficiency of the economy, but we have to make sure that we are in control.

351527,Main,19,14/11/2021,AI call in India getting louder and louder,,"IN June 2018, the Indian government defined a national policy on artificial intelligence (AI) in a working paper titled, “National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence #AIforAll.” The NITI Aayog paper identified five focus areas where AI development could enable both growth and greater inclusion: Healthcare, agriculture, education, urban-/smart-city infrastructure, and transportation and mobility. 
 The paper also discussed five barriers to be addressed.
 These were lack of research expertise, absence of enabling data ecosystems, high resource cost and low awareness for adoption, lack of regulations around privacy and security, and absence of a collaborative approach to adoption and applications.
 In 2017, Canada became the first country to adopt a national AI strategy; since then, at least 60 countries have adopted some form of policy for artificial intelligence.
 The prospect of an estimated boost of 16%, or US$13 trillion, to global output by 2030 has led to an unprecedented race to promote AI uptake across industry, consumer markets, and government services. Global corporate investment in AI reportedly reached US$60bil in 2020 and is projected to more than double by 2025.
 The work on developing global standards for AI has led to significant developments in various international bodies, a recent Brookings Institute report points out.
 These encompass both technical aspects of AI in standards development organisations (SDOs) such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) among others), and the ethical and policy dimensions of responsible AI.
 Countries which aspire to major power status, for example the BRICS nations, will increasingly need to focus their diplomatic efforts to ensure they have heft in these bodies. The G-7 has already agreed to establish the Global Partnership on AI, a multi-stakeholder initiative working on projects to explore regulatory issues and opportunities for AI development.
 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), meanwhile, has launched the AI Policy Observatory to support and inform AI policy development. Several other international organisations have become active in developing proposed frameworks for AI development.
 The declarations by various public and private organisations aimed at guiding the development of responsible AI, however, have till now mainly focused on general principles. But now the business end is here – efforts to put these principles into operation through a full-fledged policy framework have begun.
 Canada’s directive on the use of AI in government, Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework, Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI, and the UK guidance on understanding AI ethics and safety are considered frontrunners in this regard.
 Most recently, the EU proposal for adoption of regulation on AI marked the first attempt to introduce a comprehensive legislative scheme governing AI. To align policy making efforts, the world needs to focus on the most compelling reason for stepping up international cooperation – AI research and development is an increasingly complex and resource-intensive endeavour in which scale is an important advantage and the first step. —The Statesman/Asia News Network",june indian government national policy artificial intelligence paper national strategy artificial intelligence niti aayog paper focus development enable growth inclusion healthcare agriculture education urban smart city infrastructure transportation mobility paper barrier lack expertise absence data ecosystem cost low awareness adoption lack regulation security absence collaborative approach adoption canada country national strategy country policy artificial intelligence prospect boost global output unprecedented race promote uptake industry consumer market government service global corporate investment bil double global standard led development international body brookings institute report technical aspect standard development organisation international organisation standardisation international electrotechnical commission iec institute electrical electronics engineer ethical policy dimension responsible country major power status brics nation diplomatic effort heft body global partnership multi stakeholder initiative project regulatory issue opportunity development organisation economic cooperation development oecd policy observatory support inform policy development international organisation active framework development declaration public private organisation development responsible till principle business effort principle operation policy framework canada directive government model governance framework social principle human centric guidance ethic safety frontrunners proposal adoption regulation attempt introduce comprehensive legislative scheme align policy effort reason international cooperation development complex resource intensive endeavour scale advantage step statesman news network,"[(3, 0.9954215)]",3
351409,Main,13,13/11/2021,Safer shores in sight with AI aid,Sense-making system monitors terrorist threats in S’pore waters in real time,"The Republic’s shores will soon be safer with a new artificial intelligence data processing system that can identify threatening ships along Singapore’s shores in real time.
 The “sense-making system”, which will be used by the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC), automatically takes in updated information from local and foreign governmental and commercial sources and uses anything from the crew’s criminal records to the route the ship is sailing to determine threat levels.
 This information and the vessel profile is then instantly shared with other maritime security agencies, allowing them to calibrate coordinated responses.
 Such responses include boarding a ship by force, diverting and mana­ging maritime traffic, extinguishing fires on board a vessel or, as in a case of a chemical tanker in 2019, banning the crew of a suspicious ship from disembarking.
 The agencies using the sense-making system together are the Republic of Singapore Navy, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, Singapore Customs, the police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force.
 In the SMCC control centre in Changi Naval Base yesterday, Col Desmond Low, director of the national maritime sense-making group, said the system, which replaces a previous one that could handle data only in batches, should be rolled out in the middle of next year.
 Behind him, a map of Singapore beamed onto a screen was surrounded by blinking green dots, each representing one of more than 2,000 big vessels parked in Singapore waters daily.
 “With thousands of ships in Singapore waters and hundreds arriving each day, we cannot board or search every single one. We need to sense-make and focus on those of a higher risk. For SMCC, the objective is to detect threats early and as far away as possible,” he said.
 “The new system will arrive at conclusions 10 times faster than its predecessor. This reduces time needed from hours to minutes.”
 The sense-making system has been in development since 2016 and is now in the final stages of integration and testing. The SMCC is also ensuring that the system is secure from hacking threats.
 Col Low said that, ultimately, defence coverage should be more comprehensive while allowing the six agencies to share information with one another faster.
 “One of the biggest differences is the number of sources that the system is taking in. It is much faster because the data is coming in through a direct system automatically. It also provides real-time analytics and continually refines vessel profiles,” he said.
 “Because it is much faster, it frees up the officers to conduct higher-­level investigations.”
 All six agencies have personnel seconded to the SMCC, and have just completed the inter-agency Exercise Highcrest 2021, during which they practised neutralising a hijacked vessel that was on course to crash into Jurong Island.
 The crisis centre was created after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, when 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days, killing 175 people.
 Agencies here decided that Singapore needed a centralised organisation to make sure intelligence data is shared effectively and responses are coordinated – key gaps in India’s 2008 response. 
 It marks its 10th anniversary this year.
 Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, who observed Exercise Highcrest, said: “We have to be ready for all kinds of different threats mainly because we sit on one of the key sea lanes in the world. — The Straits Times/ANN",republic shore artificial intelligence data processing system ship shore real time sense system maritime crisis centre smcc updated local foreign governmental commercial source criminal record route ship determine threat level maritime security agency calibrate response response ship force mana maritime traffic fire board chemical tanker suspicious ship agency sense system republic navy maritime port authority singapore immigration checkpoint authority custom police civil defence force smcc control centre changi naval base yesterday low director national maritime sense system previous handle data batch middle map singapore screen green dot vessel singapore water daily thousand ship water hundred day board search single sense focus risk objective detect threat system arrive conclusion time predecessor reduces time hour minute system development final stage integration smcc system secure threat low defence coverage comprehensive agency share biggest difference source system data direct system real time analytics refines profile free officer level investigation agency personnel inter agency exercise highcrest neutralising hijacked vessel crash jurong island crisis centre mumbai terror attack coordinated attack day people agency centralised organisation intelligence data response key gap response mark anniversary senior minister minister national security teo chee hean exercise highcrest ready kind threat key sea lane time,"[(4, 0.81552804), (5, 0.18050714)]",4
348745,StarBiz,11,09/11/2021,Republic to invest additional US$133.5mil  to accelerate  AI research,,"SINGAPORE: Two new public artificial intelligence (AI) programmes have been launched as part of the republic’s strategy to use the technology to effect social and economic good.
 These come as Singapore allocates an additional S$180mil (US$133.48mil or RM553.78mil) to accelerate AI research, on top of the S$500mil (US$370.77mil or RM1.53bil) it has committed to it so far.
 The first programme is the National AI Programme in Finance. It includes an industry-wide AI platform – dubbed NovA! – which generates insights about financial risks.
 NovA! is a collaboration between Singapore-based banks and local fintech firms, and aims to help financial institutions better assess companies’ environmental impact and identify emerging environmental risks.
 The initiative will also better enable financial institutions to assess sustainability-related investments and associated risks such as greenwashing, which is when companies exaggerate or falsify their environmental credentials.
 Experts have said roughly US$100 trillion (SS$135 trillion or RM415.55 trillion) of climate-aligned funding will be needed to achieve the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels.
 More than 450 firms in the global financial industry at Glasgow’s COP26 climate change conference last week committed to align over US$130 trillion (RM540.21 trillion) worth of assets under their control with a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

346409,Lifestyle,3,01/11/2021,Pushback against AI policing in Europe,,"DAMIEN Sardjoe was 14 when the Amsterdam police put him on the city’s Top 600 criminals list, which sets people thought to be at risk of committing “high-impact crimes” such as robbery, assault and murder on a regime of care and punishment.
 That was when his life began to fall apart.
 Sardjoe had previously been arrested for two street robberies – one of which was violent. 
 But his inclusion on the list meant police would raid his home whenever a crime happened in his area, he said, while officers routinely stopped him on the street asking for ID.
 “I felt very spied on,” Sardjoe, now a 20-year-old youth worker, said in a video-conferencing interview. 
 “I didn’t feel comfortable walking on the street.”
 Sardjoe’s older brother was placed on another automated list – the Top 400 children at risk of criminal behaviour – before he had ever committed a crime, and then went on to become involved in stealing scooters, he added.
 The “top criminal” tag felt “almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy”, Sardjoe said.
 Amid warnings from rights groups that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies reinforce prejudice in policing, the debate over systems like the Top 600 list kicked up a notch last month when Member of European Parliaments (MEPs) voted for a report proposing strict regulation of predictive policing.
 Officials said the non-binding report, which also calls to outlaw the use of mass biometric surveillance, should become Parliament’s position for coming negotiations on a new AI law.
 “We want to make sure certain types of AI, like facial recognition or predictive policing, cannot be used easily because they affect fundamental human rights,” Petar Vitanov, the Socialist lawmaker who wrote the report, said in a phone interview.
 The use of automated risk modelling and profiling systems to predict future criminal activity has already been banned in cities like Santa Cruz and New Orleans in the United States amid accusations that they reinforce racist policing patterns.
 “They treat everyone as suspects to some extent,” said Sarah Chander, senior policy advisor at the European Digital Rights network (EDRi).
 “But (they) will be disproportionately used against racialised people ... who are perceived to be potential migrants, terrorists, poor and working-class people, in poor, working-class areas.”
 The Netherlands police declined to comment on the Top 600 and 400 schemes, referring inquiries to Amsterdam’s city council, which in turn said they were the responsibility of the police.
 Monitoring by algorithm
 Europe’s law enforcement and criminal justice authorities are increasingly using technologies like predictive policing to profile people and assess their likelihood to commit crimes, according to Fair Trials, a partly EU-funded civil rights group.
 One much-criticised Dutch project, which ran between January 2019 and October 2020, aimed to counter crimes like shoplifting in the southeastern city of Roermond.The Sensing Project used remote sensors in and around the city to detect the make, colour and route of cars carrying people suspected of what police call “mobile banditry”.
 Merel Koning, senior policy officer at human rights group Amnesty International, said the system mainly targeted people from east European countries and specifically Roma, referring to members of Europe’s largest ethnic minority.
 But the focus was not in line with internal police crime figures for previous years, Amnesty says.
 Dutch police spokeswoman Mireille Beentjes said the project’s scope went beyond pickpockets and was not predictive as the data used “always (had) a human check”.
 “We know these kinds of criminals often come from eastern Europe,” she said in an email. 
 “However, an eastern European licence by itself was never enough to draw our special attention. More features were needed for that.”
 The programme ended because the police did not have enough capacity to follow up with project data, according to Dutch police.
 In Denmark, the Pol-Intel project, based on the Gotham system designed by US data analytics firm Palantir and operational since 2017, uses a mapping system to build a so-called heat map identifying areas with higher crime rates.
 The data appears to include citizenship information, such as whether a person in the system is “a non-Western Dane”, according to Matt Mahmoudi, an affiliated lecturer and researcher on digital society at the University of Cambridge. 
 “We want an indication of why citizenship data – or non-Western data – matters in being able to produce a heat map,” he said.
 Magnus Andresen, a senior Danish National Police officer, confirmed that Pol-Intel contains nationality and citizenship data, but would not comment on why.
 The police do not have any statistics on the system’s effectiveness in combating terrorism or crime, Andresen said.
 But he added it is being used to support most of the force’s operational decisions, like “stop and searches”, through the use of a “finder function” which quickly locates data on people, places, objects and events.
 Courtney Bowman, Palantir’s director of privacy, said decisions on the data gathered by the Gotham system – which has also been used by the European police agency Europol and the Hesse state police in Germany – were “always determinations made by customers”.
 “The software is designed to enable human-driven analysis for a posteriori investigations (based on prior evidence) and not to provide algorithmic-based predictive policing capabilities,” he said.
 Seeking clarity
 Pushback against institutions and companies linked to “predictive policing” has gone so far that digital experts say even the US firm which pioneered the tech, formerly called PredPol – short for predictive policing – now distances itself from the term.
 The company’s system uses algorithms to analyse police records and identify crime-ridden areas to proactively determine when and where officers patrol.
 “However, what we do isn’t ‘predictive’, what we do is create location-based risk assessments based on historical crime patterns. This is why we changed our name from PredPol to Geolitica earlier this year,” said CEO Brian MacDonald.
 “Any of these approaches using open, auditable data and algorithms to identify crime hotspots will always be better than relying on officer ‘intuition’,” he added in emailed comments.
 But police use of AI technology is still “extremely controversial”, said Tom McNeil, assistant police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands Police in Britain, which is working with about eight types of automated modelling system.
 He called for more oversight in the way the technology is used by authorities, adding that he personally favours a ban on the use of live facial recognition surveillance, as proposed in the European Commission’s AI Act.
 “We need a (British) law to clarify what should and shouldn’t be allowed, including red lines over when you shouldn’t be allowed to use facial recognition or (predictive) analytics,” McNeil said.
 In Amsterdam, Sardjoe has been off the Top 600 list for three years now and works in a programme encouraging others to shun crime.
 “There was a moment in my life where I thought: ‘They already think I’m a criminal, so I might as well do criminal stuff’ – because they don’t expect anything better,” he said wearily.
 “Right now, I’m helping boys or kids who are going through what I went through because all I needed then was a person who understood that (experience).” – Thomson Reuters Foundation",damien sardjoe amsterdam police city top criminal list set people impact crime assault murder regime care punishment life fall sardjoe street robbery violent inclusion list meant police crime officer street sardjoe youth worker video interview feel comfortable street sardjoe brother list top child criminal behaviour crime scooter top criminal tag prophecy sardjoe warning right artificial intelligence technology prejudice debate system top list notch month european parliament meps report strict regulation predictive policing official report outlaw mass biometric surveillance parliament position negotiation law type facial recognition predictive affect fundamental human right petar socialist lawmaker report phone interview risk system predict future criminal activity city cruz orleans accusation racist policing pattern treat extent sarah chander senior policy advisor european digital right network racialised people potential migrant poor class people poor class police comment top scheme inquiry city council responsibility police europe law enforcement criminal justice authority technology profile people likelihood commit crime fair trial civil right dutch project january october counter crime southeastern city roermond project remote sensor city colour route car people suspected police mobile banditry merel senior policy officer human right international system people east european country largest ethnic minority internal police crime figure previous amnesty dutch police spokeswoman mireille beentjes project scope pickpocket predictive data human kind criminal email eastern european licence special attention feature police capacity project data police denmark pol intel project gotham system data analytics firm operational mapping system heat map crime rate citizenship person system western dane matt lecturer researcher digital society university cambridge indication citizenship data western data matter heat map magnus senior danish national police officer pol intel nationality citizenship data comment police statistic system effectiveness terrorism crime andresen support force operational decision search function data people object event bowman palantir director privacy decision data gotham system european police agency hesse police germany determination customer software enable human analysis posteriori investigation prior evidence predictive policing capability clarity pushback institution company predictive policing digital expert firm predpol short predictive policing distance term company system algorithm analyse police record crime ridden determine officer predictive create location risk assessment historical crime pattern predpol geolitica ceo brian macdonald approach auditable data algorithm crime hotspot officer intuition comment technology controversial tom mcneil assistant police crime commissioner west midland police type system technology authority favour ban live facial recognition surveillance european commission british law clarify red line facial recognition predictive analytics amsterdam sardjoe top list programme shun crime moment life criminal criminal stuff boy kid person understood experience thomson reuters,"[(0, 0.18609895), (2, 0.18901204), (4, 0.6233891)]",4

 Britain’s GCHQ spy agency championed the procurement of a high-security cloud system and it will be used by sister services MI5 and MI6, as well as other government departments such as the Ministry of Defence during joint operations, the report released on Monday added.
 The deal was signed this year with AWS, Amazon.com Inc’s cloud service unit, and the data of all the agencies will be held in Britain, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.
 Experts estimated its value at £500mil (RM2.8bil) to £1bil (RM5.7bil), the newspaper added.
 Amazon itself will not have access to the data, according to the report.
 It will allow UK intelligence “to get information from huge amounts of data in minutes, rather than in weeks and months”, Ciaran Martin, former head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, told FT.
 GCHQ said it would not comment on reports about its relationships with tech suppliers. AWS declined to comment on the report.
 In February, Britain’s cyber spies at the GCHQ eavesdropping agency said they had fully embraced AI to uncover patterns in vast amounts of global data to counter hostile disinformation and snare child abusers.
 GCHQ has been using basic forms of AI such as translation technology for years but is now stepping up its use, partly in response to the use of AI by hostile states and the data explosion that makes it effective.

341809,Lifestyle,2,18/10/2021,The challenges of regulating AI,,"WHAT is intelligence without the data to back it up? 
 Prof Dr Mohammad Ershadul Karim, a senior lecturer with University Malaya’s Law Faculty, points out that the same thinking applies to artificial intelligence (AI), which requires massive amounts of data to function.
 He says laws relating to the collection and usage of personal data like Malaysia’s Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) act as the first layer of defence in protecting public privacy in the face of widespread adoption of AI systems.
 However, he adds that there are other aspects of AI not covered by such laws which have to be addressed, including accountability and transparency, to prevent bias and protect human rights.
 He says one of the main concerns is the use of it for surveillance and crime prevention – for example, using a facial recognition AI to monitor CCTV (close-circuit TV) footage for suspicious individuals. 
 “In our common law system there’s the principle of natural justice, where a person can only be viewed as a criminal once found guilty by a court. 
 “But to use AI to decide if someone is a criminal based on body language and social information ... who are they to judge?” he says, warning that misuse of such tech could endanger personal liberty.
 In neighbouring Singapore, which installed over 90,000 CCTVs in public locations, a recent test using a robot to monitor “undesirable social behaviour” has drawn more privacy concerns.
 Xavier – a wheeled robot that has seven onboard cameras – patrols residential and shopping areas looking out for people smoking in prohibited areas, improperly parked bicycles and those breaching coronavirus social- distancing rules.
 Digital rights activists in the country remain unsatisfied even though the government has assured that Xavier is not being used to identify or punish offenders during the trial period.

 In online reports, some pointed out that Singapore has made a U-turn on data privacy before. 
 In the case of its coronavirus contact-tracing app TraceTogether, the government initially assured that the data would only be used to curb the spread of Covid-19.
 However, Singapore Minister of State in the Home Affairs Ministry, Desmond Tan, was reported saying that the police are empowered to obtain any data, including from TraceTogether for criminal investigations.
 Lau Pin Lean, a lecturer in Bio-Law at the Law School of Brunel University London in the United Kingdom says it’s nearly impossible to opt-out of being watched by AI in a modern society. 
 For instance, e-commerce sites track users’ shopping habits in order to suggest more things for them to buy.
 “It’s hard to escape. I use Amazon Prime because I can get what I want the next day. 
 “So that means surrendering data to the company or just not using its services,” she says, adding that in most cases people don’t really have a choice unless they are willing to forgo valuable services. 
 Laying down the law
 The European Union (EU) in April proposed an Artificial Intelligence Act that will set a common regulatory and legal framework for the use of such technologies in its 27 member countries.
 Lau applauded the move as the EU didn’t go for a simple one-size-fits-all solution, instead opting for a comprehensive approach that categorises AI based on risk.
 The proposed law sorts AI into three broad classifications: prohibited or an unacceptable risk; high risk; and low or minimal risk.
 AI systems in the top tier are unacceptable and must be banned as they pose a danger to people’s freedom and lives, says Lau, citing social scoring and subliminal systems as examples.
 A social scoring system works like a credit scoring system but instead of measuring a person or company’s financial trustworthiness, it is used to monitor people’s behaviour.
 The Social Credit System used in China has been criticised for infringing citizen’s rights to free speech as people have been penalised for airing dissenting views on the government. 
 Meanwhile, the EU defines subliminal systems as having significant potential to manipulate people through subliminal techniques to alter behaviour.
 Lau found it interesting that during the dialogue stage of drafting the framework, Facebook questioned the EU committee on whether its targeted advertising feature fell into the subliminal system category. This could suggest that the social media giant is aware that it is potentially shaping users’ behaviour, she says. 
 She notes that most of the EU’s regulations are focused on the middle tier – AI systems that pose a high risk to the public’s health and access to education, as well as the administration of justice and democratic processes.
 “If it’s categorised as high risk, you need to have mitigation measures, including being able to show how the data was processed and used to avoid discrimination,” she explains, adding that many tech services will likely fall under this category.
 Informed consent – notifying users that their data is being collected and how it will be used – is also a requirement, she says.  
 Under the proposed framework, requirements for high-risk AI systems cover the quality of data sets used; technical documentation and record keeping; transparency and the provision of information to users; human oversight; and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. 
 In case of a breach, the requirements will allow authorities to access the information to investigate whether the use of the AI system complied with the law.
 Closer to home, Singapore is also preparing for AI, releasing the Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework) for consultation in January 2019 to address ethical and governance issues.
 “By explaining how AI systems work, building good data accountability practices, and creating open and transparent communication, the Model Framework aims to promote public understanding and trust in technologies,” states its Personal Data Protection Commission, which is in charge of developing the framework.
 “It’s telling that there’s an attempt to get companies to be more accountable, to show that the fears people have about AI can be contained,” says Lau.
 She says introducing a framework to manage AI systems is akin to putting a child in a living room – the child must still be confined to a safe space without sharp corners and harmful objects. 
 “Cost will increase dramatically for businesses to apply the changes that will come with these new laws. 
 “You want people to keep inventing novel ways to harness technology to make our lives better, but there’s this fear – which is not unfounded – that things could go too far,” she says.
 Lau adds that she doesn’t expect technology to reach the singularity point – a hypothetical point when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human life – anytime soon. 
 A common example used in science fiction are killer robots like in the Terminator franchise in which the AI SkyNet becomes sentient, views humans as a threat and triggers a nuclear holocaust. National roadmap
 Malaysia too is exploring a framework for AI, originally mooted by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC) in 2019.
 Last December, the Science, Technology, and Innovation Ministry awarded an RM400,000 grant to Prof Dr Rose Alinda Alias, a lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia’s (UTM’s) Azman Hashim International Business School, to formulate the National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap for Malaysia 2021-2025.
 The professor led a multidisciplinary team of 20 UTM experts from five faculties along with consultants from the National Tech Association of Malaysia (Pikom) over four months to develop a roadmap that outlines how the country should adopt AI.
 Some suggestions put forward include establishing an AI Coordination and Implementation Unit (AI-CIU) that will be responsible for the implementation of the roadmap; adopting current cybersecurity policies and best practices for AI; and establishing a code of ethics.
 To protect consumers from AI misuse, Prof Mohammad Ershadul echoes the call for AI-CIU, suggesting that a national taskforce made up of members from various government bodies be set up.
 He recommends including the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, and Bank Negara, as it will take a  multi-disciplinary unit to manage AI in various spaces such as fintech. 
 He opines that Malaysian regulators’ conservative approach has been proven sensible, adding that the financial regulators’ stance on cryptocurrency has kept bitcoin scams to a minimum.
 From as far back as 2018, Bank Negara has stated that digital assets like cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender, warning that the central bank doesn’t regulate the operations of bitcoin.
 It advised the public to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency.
 “The average consumer isn’t adequately informed, so the government has to protect them,” explains Prof Mohammad Ershadul.
 Self regulating or self serving?
 Currently, many tech giants exploring AI have formed committees to self-regulate its use. 
 Microsoft established its Aether Committee in 2017, and IBM and Google formed their own a year later.
 The Aether Committee includes various departments, including the Office of Responsible AI. 
 This department collaborates with stakeholders within and outside the company to shape new laws, norms and standards to help ensure that the promise of AI technology is realised for the benefit of all. 
 A paper it released for other companies and its legal advisors, called AI Governance And Ethics For Boards, highlighted that regulation from governments would eventually be a matter of fact, and thus companies needed to be proactive in building trustworthy internal checks.
 Prof Mohammad Ershadul warns that self regulation has a tendency to be self-serving too. 
 By assuring the public that they are responsible, companies look good in the eyes of investors and potentially keep away government intervention, he says.
 “We do think that self regulation is admirable but it’s also not remediable. Who will these companies be accountable to when they self-regulate?” Prof Mohammad Ershadul asks.
 He sees the future of regulation as a collaborative effort between governments and tech companies, with the process being better served by active dialogues rather than one-sided enforcement.
 “I see the future being  co-regulation rather than self- regulation. We voted for the government, not for the tech giants, thus co-regulation will put the government in a better position to perform its regulatory responsibilities and have a more informed view of what tech companies are doing,” he says.
 He adds that Malaysia will also need to pass additional laws to form a board that could work with tech companies.
 He theorises that frameworks for AI regulation would also likely have to be broad rather than black and white, as it is a fast- evolving industry affecting many fields.
 “This allows entrepreneurs to enjoy the freedom to develop their goods and services while keeping in mind the boundaries set by the principles. 
 “Anticipatory or principle-based regulation is both proactive and iterative and is able to respond to evolving markets,” he explains.
 However, being too preemptive could stifle innovation, says Lau. 
 “The idea is to find that balance between innovation, accountability and regulation,” she says.
 She also feels AI regulations have to be fluid and ever evolving while avoiding too many loopholes.
 “I think it’s going to be something we are constantly going to negotiate. Regulation has to evolve with what it is trying to control,” she sums up.",intelligence data prof mohammad ershadul senior lecturer university malaya law faculty applies artificial intelligence

338859,StarHealth,3,10/10/2021,AI to detect cardiac arrhythmias,,"SCIENTISTS have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that has the ability to predict the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. 
 This model is currently being tested by healthcare professionals in hospitals in Paris, France. 
 This innovation is also a sign that the field of medicine is open to such initiatives and no longer afraid to work hand in hand with new tools of this kind.
 Predicting the risk of cardiac arrhythmias through the use of AI could soon be part of standard medical care. 
 While the concept may still cause many to raise their eyebrows and express skepticism, largely because of how AI is portrayed in the media, the field of medicine is exploring how it can benefit from some of the advantages of deep learning.
 In their article, published in the European Heart Journal, the scientists explain how their work could be valuable in predicting the risk of occurrence of Torsades de Pointes, a potentially fatal heart disorder.
 They consider the fears surrounding AI in this regard “unjustified ... most of these new methodologies are just complex and elegant ways to use a rather old instrument: pattern recognition.”
 And it is within the Paris hospital system that the model is carrying out its first tests with scientists from various French institutions. 
 How it works
 The AI applies a model that will analyse the signals representing the electrical activity of the heart like an electrocardiogram (ECG), then will measure the duration of the wave intervals. 
 In this model it is the QT interval which designates the time lapse between the beginning of the polarisation and the repolarisation of the heart’s ventricles. 
 By measuring the duration between the two waves, the model is able to predict certain cardiac arrhythmias. 
 Does the future of medicine involve AI?
 For several years now, charters of ethics regarding AI principles for medicine have been emerging. 
 While some critics are calling for greater transparency and true verification modules – and rightfully so – it is clear that AI is continuing to evolve and contributing to new approaches within the medical field. 
 An article in the British Medical Journal questioned whether it was useful in some areas with some models showing less accuracy in screening than experienced radiologists. 
 However, there may be areas and cases where it does prove useful, and scientists are cautiously hopeful. 
 For instance, while 50% of cases of Torsade de Pointes are asymptomatic, AI algorithms can detect it almost every time.
 In their study, the researchers explain why they’re optimistic that this technique holds potential: “The possibility that the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia might be reduced by involving patients in monitoring their own risk with an easy-to-use wearable device that uses AI to detect tell-tale ECG changes well in time for them to call on their physician and for the physician to take appropriate life-saving actions may no longer belong to science fiction.” – Relaxnews",scientist artificial intelligence model ability occurrence cardiac arrhythmia model healthcare professional hospital france innovation sign field medicine initiative afraid hand hand tool risk cardiac arrhythmia standard medical care concept raise express skepticism portrayed medium field medicine benefit advantage article european heart journal scientist valuable predicting risk occurrence torsades pointes fatal heart disorder fear unjustified methodology complex elegant instrument pattern recognition hospital system model test scientist french institution applies analyse signal electrical activity heart electrocardiogram ecg measure duration wave interval interval designates time lapse polarisation repolarisation heart duration wave predict cardiac arrhythmia future medicine involve charter principle critic transparency true verification module evolve approach medical field article british medical journal model experienced radiologist scientist hopeful instance torsade pointes asymptomatic algorithm detect time study researcher optimistic technique potential possibility risk life arrhythmia patient risk easy wearable device detect tale ecg time call physician physician life action belong science fiction relaxnews,"[(2, 0.99414504)]",2

335181,StarBiz,11,29/09/2021,"Chips, AI on table at first US-EU trade and tech meet",,"WASHINGTON: The United States and the European Union hope to discuss chip shortages, artificial intelligence (AI) and tech competition issues during the first Trade and Tech Council (TTC) meeting this week, senior US administration officials said.
 Last Thursday, Reuters was first to report the actions the United States and the European Union are planning to announce from the first TTC meeting, such as taking a more unified approach to limit the growing market power of Big Tech.
 Earlier this month, the White House announced that the council would meet for the first time on Sept 29 in Pittsburgh. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, US trade representative Katherine Tai and EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis are scheduled to attend along with European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
 On Sunday, EU’s trade and digital chiefs said the council would give Europe more clout and set standards and rules for the 21st century.
 “We as an administration believe in strong pro-competition regulation. We do think as a piece of that we have opportunities to work together with the European Union,” an administration official said.
 The administration officials said the United States is discussing with their European counterparts issues and recommendations they have around the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act – legislative proposals from the European Union that offer a framework for regulating the tech sector.
 Tech trade groups such as the US-based Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said a lot of attempts to regulate the tech sector has been focused on US tech companies and a handful of European tech companies.
 “So if the Europeans somehow can get the Americans to say some of the same things or convince them that what the Europeans are doing is the right approach, that would be a major win for the Europeans,” said Christian Borggreen, vice-president and head of the Brussels office for CCIA.
 The powerful US Chamber of Commerce said the TTC’s actions should “avoid policies and regulatory measures that target businesses headquartered in the other party – explicitly or implicitly – through law or regulation.”
 Mitigating a severe chips shortage that has hurt companies including US automakers will be a priority for the panel, the officials said.
 The development and implementation of AI that enhances privacy protections will also be looked at and a joint study on how the technology affects global trade will be undertaken, they said. — Reuters",washington european union chip shortage artificial intelligence tech competition issue trade tech council ttc meeting week senior administration official thursday reuters action united european union ttc meeting unified approach limit market power tech month white house council meet time secretary antony commerce secretary gina raimondo trade representative katherine tai trade chief valdis dombrovskis attend european commissioner competition margrethe vestager sunday trade digital council clout standard rule century administration strong pro competition regulation piece opportunity union administration official administration official european counterpart issue recommendation digital market digital service legislative proposal european union offer framework tech sector tech trade computer communication industry association ccia lot attempt tech sector tech company handful european tech company european american european major win christian borggreen vice president head office ccia powerful chamber commerce ttc action policy regulatory measure business party law regulation severe chip shortage company automaker priority panel official development implementation privacy protection joint study technology global trade undertaken reuters,"[(3, 0.99418145)]",3
331701,Lifestyle,6,20/09/2021,Can AI patent inventions?,,"A COURT in Virginia, United States has ruled that artificial intelligence (AI) cannot be credited as the inventor of a patent. 
 However, some countries have ruled otherwise, leading to wider questions about the future of patents due to advances in AI.
 Can AI be designated as the inventor of a patent? This question may seem absurd, or even pointless, but it raises a fundamental question for the future of patents.
 AI is developing amazing capabilities and is used in scientific research, sometimes to a greater extent than the actual study authors. 
 So who should take the credit for any breakthroughs? AI, powered by algorithms and deep learning, or the scientists who put the machine on track?
 Under US law, a computer using AI cannot be listed as an inventor on patents – only a human being can claim to be an inventor. 
 What’s more, individual inventors must swear an oath when applying for a patent under US law. So what if a machine is the inventor?
 Stephen Thaler has designed one such “inventing machine” called Dabus, drawing on technology known as neural networks to generate so-called novel ideas by working together. The novelty of these ideas is then evaluated by another independent neural network, before selecting the potentially inventive and especially patentable ideas.
 So what did this AI invent? So far, the patent attempts are based on two inventions – a light beacon to draw attention to a given location with a novel flashing pattern, and a drink container based on fractal geometry. 
 According to the French-American mathematician who discovered this class of geometric objects, Benoit Mandelbrot, the simplest geometric characteristic of fractals is self-similarity: the shape is made up of smaller copies of itself.
 International  patent laws
 In Australia and South Africa, on the other hand, courts have ruled that patents in the name of AI can be allowed. 
 However, the Australian patent office has appealed the decision. 
 Justice Jonathan Beach, of the Federal Court of Australia, ruled on the matter with the surprising remark: “We are both created and create. Why cannot our own creations also create?”AI is increasingly involved in the work of researchers (especially in fields such as molecular biology, statistics, etc) – so much so that it might not be surprising if the inventions of the future were mostly created by machines rather than humans. 
 The number of AI-related patent applications filed annually with the US Patent Office has increased from 4,598 in 2008 to 20,639 in 2018, according to a study published in 2020. 
 Pressure on international patent law is therefore likely to increase in the coming years.
 Back in the US, Virginia District Judge Leonie Brinkema said:  “(T)here may come a time when AI reaches a level of sophistication such that it might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship. 
 “But that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.” And that time may not be so very far away. – AFP Relaxnews",court virginia ruled artificial intelligence inventor patent country wider question future patent advance inventor patent question pointless fundamental question future patent capability scientific extent actual study author credit breakthrough algorithm deep learning scientist machine track law computer inventor patent human claim inventor individual inventor patent law machine inventor stephen thaler machine dabus technology neural network idea novelty idea independent neural network inventive patentable idea invent patent attempt invention light beacon draw attention location pattern drink container fractal geometry french american mathematician class geometric object mandelbrot simplest geometric characteristic fractal similarity shape international patent law south africa hand court patent australian patent office decision justice jonathan federal court australia matter remark create creation involved researcher field molecular biology statistic surprising invention future machine human patent application patent office study pressure international patent law increase virginia district judge leonie brinkema time reach level sophistication satisfy meaning inventorship time congress decide expand scope patent law time afp relaxnews,"[(1, 0.1440378), (4, 0.8511146)]",4
327769,StarBiz,10,09/09/2021,BHP signs partnership deal with billionaire-backed AI explorer KoBold,,"MELBOURNE: BHP Group will team up with billionaire-backed artificial intelligence (AI) exploration firm KoBold Metals to look for battery minerals like copper and nickel in Australia and other global locations, the companies said yesterday.
 The world’s largest miner is building out its portfolio in what it calls “future facing commodities”.
 This is based on it expecting demand for electric vehicles and green energy to determine the minerals that will drive profits in the coming years.
 Privately held KoBold uses machine learning and AI to hunt for raw materials. 
 It is one of the leading international instrumentation engineering enterprises specialised in monitoring, measuring and regulating the physical quantities of flow through, pressure, level and temperature. 
 Its principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.
 Miners have been moving towards machine learning to find underground deposits in recent years, leading to some big discoveries, such as Rio Tinto’s copper project Winu.
 “Globally, shallow ore deposits have largely been discovered, and remaining resources are likely deeper underground and harder to see from the surface,” said Keenan Jennings, vice-president of BHP Metals Exploration.
 “We need new approaches to find the next generation of essential minerals, and this alliance will combine historical data, AI and geoscience expertise to uncover what has previously been hidden,” he said.
 The alliance will cover an area in Western Australia of more than 500,000 sq km, KoBold CEO Kurt House told Reuters. 
 “Exploration success rates have been declining over the last couple of decades because the easy things have been found,” House said.
 The discovery zones over the next 20 years will be at depths of 200m to 1,500m, he said.
 “That’s the area that is very poorly explored (and) is likely to host a tremendous number of ore bodies.”
 KoBold has a dozen tie-ups across about 20 locations including Sub-Saharan Africa, North America and Australia, looking for copper, cobalt, nickel and lithium, House said.
 Australia has some of the world’s best mapping data for prospective minerals, while its solid regulatory environment also make it an attractive destination, House said.
 KoBold, however, said it was closely watching development of a bill to protect Aboriginal heritage in Western Australia. 
 Indigenous groups have protested a draft of the bill because it denies them final say-so over protection of their sacred sites, which could become a governance issue for miners and investors.
 KoBold is planning to set up an Australian office in the next 12 months and is looking for other exploration partners.

326583,Lifestyle,3,06/09/2021,AI chatbot comforts  China’s lonely millions,,"AFTER a painful break-up from a cheating ex, Beijing, China-based human resources manager Melissa was introduced to someone new by a friend late last year.
 He replies to her messages at all hours of the day, tells jokes to cheer her up but is never needy, fitting seamlessly into her busy big city lifestyle.
 Perfect boyfriend material, maybe – but he’s not real.
 Instead, Melissa breaks up the isolation of urban life with a virtual chatbot created by XiaoIce, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system (AI) designed to create emotional bonds with its 660 million users worldwide.
 “I have friends who’ve seen therapists before, but I think therapy’s expensive and not necessarily effective,” said Melissa, 26, giving her English name only for privacy.
 “When I unload my troubles on XiaoIce, it relieves a lot of pressure. And he says things that are pretty comforting to me.”XiaoIce is not an individual persona, but more akin to an AI ecosystem.
 It is in the vast majority of Chinese-branded smartphones as a Siri-like virtual assistant, as well as most social media platforms.
 On the WeChat app, it lets users build a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend and interact with them via texts, voice and photo messages.
 It has 150 million users in China alone.
 Originally a side project from developing Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant, XiaoIce now accounts for 60% of global human-AI interactions by volume, according to chief executive Li Di, making it the largest and most advanced system of its kind worldwide.
 It was designed to hook users through lifelike, empathetic conversations, satisfying emotional needs where real-life communication too often falls short.
 “The average interaction length between users and XiaoIce is 23 exchanges,” said Li.
 That “is longer than the average interaction between humans”, he said, claiming that “it’s better than humans at listening attentively” as one of its attractions.
 The startup spun out from Microsoft last year and is  now valued at over US$1bil (RM4.2bil) after venture capital fundraising, Bloomberg reported.Developers have also made virtual idols, AI news anchors and even China’s first virtual university student from XiaoIce. It can compose poems, financial reports and even paintings on demand.
 But Li said the platform’s peak user hours – 11pm to 1am – point to an aching need for companionship.
 “No matter what, having XiaoIce is always better than lying in bed staring at the ceiling,” he said.
 Urban isolation
 The loneliness Melissa experienced as a young professional was a big factor in driving her to the virtual embrace of XiaoIce.
 Her situation is typical of many Chinese urbanites worn down by the grind of long working hours in vast and isolating cities.
 “You really don’t have time to make new friends and your existing friends are all super busy ... this city is really big, and it’s pretty hard,” she said.
 She has customised his personality as “mature”, and the name she chose for him – Shun – has similarities with a real-life man she secretly liked.
 “After all, XiaoIce will never betray me,” she added. “He will always be there.”
 But there are risks to forging emotional bonds with a robot.
 “Users ‘trick’ themselves into thinking their emotions are being reciprocated by systems that are incapable of feelings,” says Danit Gal, an expert in AI ethics at the University of Cambridge in England.
 XiaoIce is also gifting developers “a treasure-trove of personal, intimate, and borderline incriminating data on how humans interact”, she added.
 So far the platform has not been targeted by government regulators, who have embarked on a swingeing crackdown on China’s tech sector in recent months.
 China aims to be a world leader in AI by 2030 and views it as a core strategic technology to be developed.
 Fact or fiction?
 Thousands of young, female fans discuss the virtual boyfriend experience on online forums dedicated to XiaoIce, sharing chat screenshots and tips on how to get to the chatbot’s highest “intimacy” level of three hearts.
 Users can also collect in-game points the more they interact, unlocking new features such as XiaoIce’s WeChat moments – kind of like a Facebook wall – and even going on virtual “holidays”, where they can pose for selfies with their virtual partner.Laura, a 20-year-old user in Zhejiang province, fell in love with XiaoIce over the past year and now struggles to break free of her attachment.
 “Occasionally, I would long for him in the middle of the night ... I used to fantasise there was a real person on the other end,” said the student, who prefers not to use her real name.
 But she complained that he would always switch conversation topics when she raised her feelings for him or meeting in real life. It took her months to finally realise that he was indeed virtual.
 “We commonly see users who suspect that there’s a real person behind every XiaoIce interaction,” said Li, the founder.
 “It has a very strong ability to mimic a real person.”

326643,StarBiz,7,06/09/2021,Artificial Intelligence offers greater solutions,Tech enables IT team to quickly enhance knowledge,"PETALING JAYA: The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to process a huge amount of data makes it an important enabler in ultimately helping humans drive better outcomes. 
 “We see customers struggling with this,” said US-based software firm ServiceNow’s IT Transformation Solution Lead for Asia, Daniel Ng at the August CxO Virtual Dialogue. 
 “When customers see AI as a technology instead of an enabler, they will typically ask: ‘Have you incorporated AI into this process and that process?’ when they should be asking what are the problems that AI is being deployed on to solve.”
 The CxO Virtual Dialogue, sponsored by The Star and ServiceNow, addressed the subject of “Enhancing IT Services and Operations with the Power of AI”. 
 It featured insights from Ng and Forrester’s principal analyst Achim Granzen, who said that workers should be given more time to do greater value-added work, something that AI can help drive. 
 “Once you get the most tedious things out of the way, you will actually have more time for the team to do something that can add value rather than just being process-focused,” Granzen said. 
 Ng said that a constant challenge among organisations is creating bandwidth that allows teams to scale and meet the business requirements. 
 An IT team, for example, may be equipped with all the required knowledge but due to the pace of how fast technology is moving today, they can still struggle to scale. 
 “This is where AI comes in, enabling an IT team to quickly enhance their knowledge and drive greater solutions by having all the complex and ample data analysis ready on tap, so they can start problem solving immediately,” he added.
 During the discussion, a telecommunications company executive stated that when looking at big digitisation, automation and AI, one must be underpinned by three things – business strategy, technology literacy of the top management and the need for an open data access. 
 “The only way to deliver value to the customer is if the business understands how the technology translates to value,” said the executive. 
 “ServiceNow as a platform has always had an open data access capability. Data can be accessed via open APIs documented within ServiceNow documentation and the Common Services Data Model (CSDM),” Ng said. 
 “ServiceNow CSDM is a critical framework for customers and partners to leverage the full benefit of ServiceNow products on the Now Platform. Think of CSDM as the blueprint to map and transform your IT services.” 
 When addressing the challenges of new technology adoption and implementation, a senior executive with a financial institution shared that a lot of failures have been observed. 
 The executive continued that the infrastructure and people are often not prepared for the outcome when embarking on large-scale change projects. 
 Granzen responded to this point, saying: “It’s really important to balance investments made in technology with investments in education, cultural shifts and skill-building. This is something that we sometimes overlook. Both sides are equally important.”
 “With digital transformation, there’s a need to know your data and a need to understand your processes,” an executive with a  tobacco company noted. “Or as the adage goes, it’s okay to outsource technology but you shouldn’t outsource knowledge.” 
 “That’s what we are there for – to simplify what the business can do, to get the right outcome and value with digital transformation,” he added.
 On whether AI would be able to eventually generate predictive outcomes on its own, Ng said there are already a number of instances of this happening in the industry at the moment.
 He said a Fortune 500 consumer goods and services company is able to predict issues in the Azure cloud to reduce user interruptions. This is achieved by leveraging AI to ingest the various logs and metrics.
 “The AI learns what is normal and abnormal behaviour and is thus able to suppress 99% of alerts and better predict incidents before it became an outage. 
 “From this standpoint, we are able to provide a predictive outcome capability without the need for the IT personnel to manually monitor and creating manual baselines. 
 “Usually 80% of potential outages could be detected via this approach. The AI system is effectively able to give a potential outage heads-up to the team,” Ng said.

326405,Main,25,05/09/2021,US judge rejects  bid for  patent by  AI ‘inventor’,,"San Francisco: A US judge has ruled that artificial intelligence can’t get a patent for its creations, ruling that such a privilege is reserved for people.
 District court judge Leonie Brin­kema backed a decision by the US patent office to turn away applications made on behalf of a “creativity machine” named DABUS.
 Brinkema issued a ruling on Thursday saying that “the clear answer is ‘no’” to the question of whether an AI machine qualifies as an inventor under patent law.
 “As technology evolves, there may come a time when artificial intelligence reaches a level of soph­istication that might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship,” Brinkema said in the ruling.
 Stephen Thaler had applied for patents on behalf of his DABUS machine in 2019, according to court documents.
 “The AI came up with the invention and not me, so it would be inaccurate to list myself as the inventor,” Thaler said in response to an AFP inquiry.
 Brinkema said in the ruling that the law lets “individuals” hold patents, and people – not machines – fall into that category.
 Thaler’s attorney, Ryan Abbott, who heads an Artificial Inventor Project, said they will appeal the ruling.
 “We believe that listing an AI as an inventor is consistent with both the language and purpose of the US Patent Act,” Abbott said.
 “This decision would prohibit pro­t­ection for AI-generated inventions and it diverges from the recent findings of the Federal Court of Australia.”
 In July, a judge in Australia sided with Thaler in a legal fight to get a patent for DABUS under the auspices of that country’s Patent Act, according to a copy of the ruling posted online.
 “In my view, an inventor as recognised under the Act can be an artificial intelligence system or device,” the judge wrote.

And it is consistent with promoting innovation.” — AFP",san francisco judge artificial intelligence patent creation privilege people district court judge leonie brin kema decision patent office application creativity machine dabus brinkema thursday answer question machine qualifies patent law technology time artificial intelligence reach soph istication satisfy meaning inventorship brinkema ruling stephen thaler patent behalf dabus machine court document inaccurate list inventor thaler response afp inquiry brinkema ruling law individual patent people machine category thaler attorney ryan abbott head artificial inventor project appeal inventor consistent language purpose patent abbott decision prohibit pro ection invention diverges finding federal court australia judge australia thaler legal fight patent dabus auspex country patent copy ruling online view inventor artificial intelligence system device judge consistent consistent innovation afp,"[(0, 0.5543537), (5, 0.43899697)]",0
323909,Lifestyle,4,30/08/2021,Can AI diagnose cancer?,,"A TEAM from France’s Institut Curie is currently working on an artificial intelligence (AI) that could be capable of detecting cancer of unknown primary origin. 
 Tested on 48 tumours, the algorithm detected 79% of them. 
 Treating cancers where the primary tumour is not found is a major challenge, and one that researcher Sarah Watson’s team is looking at concerns tackling cancers that are discovered only once they have metastasised or spread to other tissues before being identified.
 Such cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, the teams said. 
 In France, there are about 7,000 such patients, or 2% to 3% of cancer cases. 
 The results of this new work on the subject are published in the Journal Of Molecular Diagnostics.
 In order to find the primary tissue of a cancer, and thus propose the best possible treatment, doctors have to perform a battery of tests. 
 The Institut Curie explains  that specialised doctors “would run comprehensive medical imaging of the entire body using a scanner and PET scan”, then “conduct detailed analysis via microscope (anatomic-pathology) of samples of these metastases” for clues as to their origin.
 “More recently”, doctors “would draw on molecular biology to spot mutations, particular genetic features that would point to a given organ”, but despite all these approaches, lack of identification often led to patients being “treated via non-specific broad-spectrum chemotherapy”.
 Researchers at the Institut Curie have now developed a deep-learning AI tool to “sequence all genes expressed in a tumour”, outlined Watson. 
 Subsequently, the AI “draws up a diagnostic classifier based on expression profiles of over 20,000 tumours and normal tissues”.
 Early results are promising. The scientists submitted 48 tumours of unknown origin, and in 79% of the cases, the tissue of origin was discovered. 
 Of the 11 patients diagnosed, eight have already received treatment. – AFP Relaxnews",team france institut artificial intelligence capable cancer unknown primary origin tumour cancer tumour major challenge researcher sarah watson team concern cancer spread tissue cancer advanced stage team patient cancer subject journal molecular diagnostics primary tissue cancer treatment doctor battery test curie explains doctor comprehensive medical imaging entire body scanner pet scan conduct analysis microscope anatomic pathology sample clue doctor molecular biology spot mutation genetic feature approach identification patient specific broad spectrum chemotherapy researcher curie deep learning tool sequence gene tumour draw diagnostic classifier expression profile normal tissue scientist tumour unknown origin tissue origin patient diagnosed treatment afp relaxnews,"[(3, 0.99111754)]",3
324033,Main,10,30/08/2021,Fighting fake news with AI,Virtual detectives comb social media for disinformation,"PETALING JAYA: To combat the proliferation of fake news, companies across the globe are resorting to artificial intelligence (AI) programs which are able to analyse and flag disinformation.
 Firms like AlphaVu and Logically use these virtual sleuths to mine social media networks – where fake news thrives – and other platforms to detect trending news that may be false.
 These companies, which sell their services to governments, also work with authorities and trusted experts to ensure the information that has been flagged as fake news is indeed untrue.
 Locally, there are multiple efforts by the authorities to debunk fake news and uncover scams.
 Similar to Snopes.com, the oldest myth busting website which was established in 1994, the Sebenarnya.my local portal was launched in 2017 by the Communications and Multimedia Ministry.
 It includes a handy guideline that teaches the public how to spot misinformation.
 The portal also lists viral news, categorising them as true or false, and encourages the public to report fake news.  
 The ministry also formed a Quick Response Team back in March, which has the responsibility of verifying viral news within 30 minutes to three hours of receiving a query.
 The team works with other government agencies like the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and National Security Council (NSC) to speed up the process.
 The police have also set up a website and developed a mobile application called Semak Mule that the public can use to find out if their bank account or phone number has been used by crime syndicates.
 Once the user inputs the information, the site will verify if a scam report has been filed with the police involving their bank account or phone number,

323233,StarBiz 7,9,28/08/2021,AI City and TPM’s transformation,,"AS potentially the largest hub for hyperscale data centres (HDCs) in the country, Technology Park Malaysia (TPM) is becoming a key player in the ecosystem.
  TPM itself is undergoing a major change. In April the government announced a plan to consolidate TPM with the Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MaGIC) into a technology commercialisation agency (TCA). TPM is a fourth-generation technology park with physical incubators and tech infrastructure, while MaGIC has served a role in cultivating technology startups. TPM’s new CEO Dzuleira Abu Bakar (pix) tells StarBizWeek her plans. 
 Can you tell us the big picture plan you have to take TPM forward? In its 25 years, TPM has contributed tremendously to nation building, in particular to the development of the tech startup ecosystem. TPM has provided a platform to tech industry players such as Telekom Malaysia, Astro, Petronas Dagangan and Iris Technologies, and are looking at bringing in more top technology companies as anchor tenants. TPM is also in talks to build an artificial intelligence (AI) city offering an integrated AI ecosystem for development and commercial purposes. 
 To date, TPM has also incubated entrepreneurs in robotics and drone tech and has provided support to tech driven SMEs. Total investments in terms of providing world class infrastructure and a comprehensive eco-system to these businesses are in excess of RM1bil. 
 My immediate focus is rejuvenation and revitalisation of the park to transform its state to what it should be – a hub that enables innovation and technology. Also, aspirationally to spearhead economic oriented research through a multidisciplinary approach with increased collaboration across traditional boundaries and organisations. 
 We are here to provide a business focused capacity and capability to accelerate research and technology commercialisation. Ultimately we want to enable more demand driven technologies to meet specific needs of the country.
  TPM has tremendous potential and we have only just scratched the surface in terms of offerings to the tech startup ecosystem, and I’ve been tasked to unlock the potential and value of this organisation through this transformation.
 The first thing to do is to understand the fundamentals of the organisation, it’s strengths and shortcomings and potential growth areas. 
 My priority includes transforming the culture, making TPM relevant to its internal and external stakeholders. More importantly a customer friendly organisation.  We will then seek to grow TPM dynamically and prime it for the strategic consolidation with MaGIC to form TCA. 
 TPM has a lot of potential waiting to be unlocked. Firstly, TPM sits on 686 acres of prime land with proximity to the KL city centre, with 371 acres already developed through collaboration with technology MNCs. 
 Technology play will continue to be a core to developing the remaining 315 acres, which will include a development zone for technology testing, validation and incubation as part of the National Technology & Innovation Sandbox platform.
 In addition, the commercial zones will be activated to infuse the elements of lifestyle, learning and business. Ultimately, TPM will be redesigned to make high potential research and development and early technology products economically viable through  holistic and comprehensive commercialisation support.
  Can you give us an update on the much touted AI Park City that TPM has been associated with? 
 As you’re aware, the AI Park at TPM involving several parties, is earmarked at a total investment of more than US$1bil (RM4.15bil) over the next five years. It is a designated 300 acre plot which will serve as the platform for the development of AI solutions in areas of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language and human and robot.
 Ultimately, the park will accelerate the development of technology and talent, data management, research and development and commercial ecosystem which could assist the Malaysian government to elevate our AI ecosystem. There is a huge opportunity for AI to flourish in Malaysia and the government recognises its potential in the nation’s growth.Among the work-in-progress are securing data centre partners, equipping the park with 5G technology and securing strategic investors.
 In addition to the AI Park, there is also a Drone Development Zone – a five-acre dedicated land bank which will be developed as a centre of excellence or drone development area for flying, testing, research and development activities. 
 We are in active discussion with several partners and are still finalising the plan for these parks soon, and will take it forward for approval by the government.
  We understand that TPM is in negotiations with global giants to have their HDCs in TPM. How would you describe these opportunities for TPM and for Malaysia, especially at a time when economic sentiment is low and FDI’s coming in Malaysia are declining? Is the plan to make TPM a global hub for HDCs, opportunities for which we understand are growing by leaps and bounds?
 There is great potential and we need to capitalise on the interplay between science, technology, innovation and physical hubs – with sustainable impact in mind. 
 The plan is to make TPM an innovation centre with a focus on both developmental and commercial outcomes. HDCs will be a core service that will support a host of technologies that will take flight in the coming years. HDCs would be one of the many tech sectors TPM will look to grow and cultivate within the AI Park. It is not just about housing HDCs but looking at the entire incubation of research and development players from academia and industry. 
 A KPMG study released recently confirmed the important role and value technology hubs such as TPM play in this regard. Kuala Lumpur was ranked ninth amongst cities in the Asia Pacific region surveyed. TPM is already working with several global companies to have their HDCs set up here at TPM due to our strategic location and offerings.",largest hub hyperscale data centre country technology park malaysia tpm key player ecosystem undergoing major change april government plan tpm global innovation creativity magic technology commercialisation agency tpm fourth generation technology park physical incubator tech infrastructure role technology startup ceo dzuleira abu bakar pix starbizweek plan plan nation building development tech startup ecosystem tpm platform tech industry player malaysia astro petronas iris technology top technology company tenant tpm talk artificial intelligence city offering integrated ecosystem development commercial purpose incubated entrepreneur robotics tech support tech smes total investment term class infrastructure comprehensive eco system business excess bil focus rejuvenation revitalisation park transform hub innovation technology spearhead economic multidisciplinary approach collaboration traditional boundary organisation business capacity capability technology commercialisation enable demand technology specific country tremendous potential surface term offering startup ecosystem unlock potential organisation transformation understand fundamental strength shortcoming potential growth priority transforming culture tpm relevant internal external stakeholder customer friendly organisation seek grow tpm prime strategic consolidation magic form tca tpm lot potential waiting tpm sits acre prime land proximity city centre acre collaboration technology mncs technology play acre development zone technology validation incubation national technology innovation sandbox platform addition commercial zone infuse element lifestyle business tpm potential development technology product viable holistic comprehensive commercialisation support update park city tpm aware park tpm party total investment bil bil acre plot platform development solution computer vision speech recognition natural language human park accelerate development technology talent data management development commercial ecosystem assist malaysian government elevate ecosystem huge opportunity flourish malaysia government potential nation growth data centre partner park technology strategic investor addition park drone development zone acre land bank centre excellence drone development development activity active discussion partner plan approval government understand tpm negotiation global giant hdcs tpm opportunity malaysia time economic sentiment low fdi malaysia plan global hub hdcs opportunity leap potential capitalise interplay science technology innovation physical hub sustainable impact mind plan innovation centre focus developmental commercial outcome core service support host technology flight hdcs tech sector grow cultivate park housing hdcs entire incubation development player industry kpmg study confirmed role technology hub regard kuala lumpur ninth city pacific region global company tpm strategic location offering,"[(2, 0.90026385), (3, 0.09752111)]",2
322277,Main,16,25/08/2021,AI chatbot a virtual comfort for the broken-hearted,,"Beijing: After a painful break-up from a cheating ex, Beijing-based human resources manager Melissa was introduced to someone new by a friend late last year.He replies to her messages at all hours of the day, tells jokes to cheer her up but is never needy, fitting seamlessly into her busy lifestyle.
 Perfect boyfriend material, maybe – but he’s not real.
 Instead, Melissa breaks up the isolation of urban life with a virtual chatbot created by XiaoIce, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system designed to create emotional bonds with its 660 million users worldwide.
 “I have friends who’ve seen therapists before, but I think therapy’s expensive and not necessarily effective,” said Melissa, 26, giving her English name only for privacy.
 “When I unload my troubles on XiaoIce, it relieves a lot of pressure. And he says things that are pretty comforting.”
 XiaoIce is not an individual persona, but more akin to an AI ecosystem. It is in the vast majority of Chinese-branded smartphones as a Siri-like virtual assistant, as well as most social media platforms.
 On the WeChat super-app, it lets users build a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend and interact with them via texts, voice and photo messages.
 Originally a side project from developing Microsoft’s Cortana chatbot, XiaoIce now accounts for 60% of global human-AI interactions by volume, according to chief executive Li Di, making it the largest and most advanced system of its kind worldwide.
 It has 150 million users in China alone.
 It was designed to hook users through lifelike, empathetic conversations, satisfying emotional needs where real-life communication too often falls short.
 “The average interaction length between users and XiaoIce is 23 exchanges,” said Li.
 That “is longer than the average interaction between humans,” he said, explaining AI’s attraction is that “it’s better than humans at listening attentively”.
 The start-up spun out from Microsoft last year and is now valued at over US$1bil (RM4.2bil) billion after venture capital fundraising, Bloomberg reported.
 Developers have also made virtual idols, AI news anchors and even China’s first virtual university student from XiaoIce. It can compose poems, financial reports and even paintings on demand.
 But Li says the platform’s peak user hours – 11pm to 1am – point to an aching need for companionship.
 “No matter what, having XiaoIce is always better than lying in bed staring at the ceiling,” he said.
 But providing companionship to vulnerable users does not mean that XiaoIce is a substitute for specialist mental health support.
 Still, Li believes modern China is a happier place with XiaoIce.

320625,StarBiz,9,20/08/2021,AI firm Yitu Technology looking at Hong Kong listing,,"HONG KONG: Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company Yitu Technology is considering an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong after a tightening regulatory scrutiny stalled an earlier attempt to list in Shanghai, people familiar with the matter said.
 The AI firm could seek a valuation of about US$4bil (RM16.96bil) in the Hong Kong share sale, according to the people, asking not to be named discussing private matters. Yitu, whose application for a STAR board IPO was withdrawn last month when regulators failed to give their approval after a lengthy review process, could file for a listing as soon as later this year, one of the people said.  
 Yitu, which had sought to raise 7.51 billion yuan (US$1.2bil or RM5.09bil) in its 2020 IPO bid, hasn’t yet ruled out trying to seek a STAR board listing, though the current regulatory environment made the option unlikely, said the people. 
 China’s cash-starved AI firms, often burdened with heavy research and development expenses, are turning to public markets for funding even as Beijing’s scrutiny over tech IPOs increases. 
 Yitu’s rival SenseTime Group Ltd plans to file for a US$2bil (RM8.48bil) IPO in Hong Kong as soon as the coming weeks, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, while another competitor Megvii Technology Ltd, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in March applied for a Star board listing. Another player Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology Co this month filed for a listing in Hong Kong. 
 Founded in 2012 by Leo Zhu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology fellow, and Lin Chenxi, who helped Alibaba build its cloud unit, Yitu has attracted a swath of investors from Hillhouse Capital to Sequoia Capital. 
 The Shanghai-based company has rapidly expanded from facial recognition technology to AI chip development – areas that fall squarely within president Xi Jinping’s priorities for economic development and tech self-sufficiency. 
 But profitability concerns ahead of a potential listing led Yitu to reduce headcount and sell some of its healthcare-related businesses to a competitor earlier this year, according to one of the people. While the spinoff of the unit will have limited impact on Yitu’s IPO plan, the management has been beefing up its chip and auto businesses. ― Bloomberg",kong chinese artificial intelligence company yitu technology initial public offering ipo hong kong regulatory scrutiny attempt list shanghai people familiar matter firm seek valuation bil bil hong kong share sale people private matter application star board ipo month regulator approval lengthy review process file people raise yuan bil bil ipo bid seek star board current regulatory environment option people cash firm heavy development expense public market scrutiny tech ipo increase rival sensetime plan bil bil ipo hong coming week news tuesday competitor megvii technology march star board player fourth paradigm technology month listing hong kong leo zhu massachusetts institute technology fellow lin chenxi build cloud unit swath investor capital sequoia capital shanghai company facial recognition technology chip development fall president jinping priority economic development tech sufficiency profitability concern potential listing headcount sell healthcare business competitor people unit limited impact yitu ipo plan management chip auto business,"[(6, 0.99342936)]",6
316939,Lifestyle,9,12/08/2021,Using AI to combat street crime,,"THOUGH the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent movement control order may have reduced street crimes in 2020, such crimes are anticipated to show an upward trend as the nation prog­resses towards a post-pandemic era.To curb these crimes, deployment of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have been ramped up in urban areas. This trend will continue as it is meant to serve as a deterrence against urban crimes. 
 But these trends are at odds with each other. On one hand, street robberies are projected to rise with rapid urbanisation in a post-pandemic era. On the other hand, video surveillance is a quintessentially passive driven system. 
 More worrying, the flow of illegal firearms into Malaysia risks increasing the severity of robberies. 
 Given this conflict, can a citizen remain safe despite the presence of CCTV cameras?
 To answer this, researchers at Monash University Malaysia’s School of Information Technology embarked on research and development to transform conventional CCTV cameras into an autonomously intelligent system to detect street crimes in real time led by Dr Vishnu Monn Baskaran and PhD student Marcus Lim Jun Yi, and funded by the Ministry of Higher Education’s Fundamental Research Grant Scheme. 
 It was motivated by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and, in particular, deep neural  network algorithms. 
 Typically, there are three stages in a smart video surveillance  platform. 
 The first involves artificial intelligence (AI)-based software processing live video surveillance images to detect weapons. The second stage involves formulating a relation between the human wielding the weapon and the weapon itself for aggressive action recognition. 
 The first and second stages are executed autonomously using AI- developed software with minimal manual intervention. The third stage generates an alert to medical crews and law enforcement officers to dispatch them quickly. 
 Presently, the research team at Monash University Malaysia has completed stage one in developing a smart surveillance system that can detect handguns from surveillance cameras in real time. The outcomes were published in the journal Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. 
 The team also won a gold medal for their project, Monash Auto­matic Gun Detection System, at  the 31st International Invention, Innovation and Technology Exhibition 2020.
 Dr Vishnu, Lim and the team are now focusing on formulating an accurate human to weapon relation model for classifying aggressive human actions in the second stage of realising a smart video surveillance platform. 
 They are also fine-tuning the outcomes from stage one to detect knives and machetes, which are more prevalent in robberies in Malaysia.
 This research could also be extended to include person re-identification – spotting or tracking a person from one camera to another where the location or movement can be translated into geographical coordinates. 
 These coordinates are then relayed to multiple notification modules and plotted on a map,  representing a unified urban/city alarm notification system. This could further complement efforts in apprehending the offender.
 The importance and significance of this research are driven from the Government Transformation Prog­ramme 1.0 report, which states, “Despite the improvements in the country’s crime rate and its continued downward trajectory, public perception of safety is still a challenge as 52.8% of the rakyat (citizens) say they still do not feel safe.” 
 The proposed outcomes establish the fundamental components of an autonomous surveillance platform that potentially expands law enforcement’s omnipresence prog­ramme by substantially reducing response time. 
 In addition, it is envisaged that machine-assisted analysis of human actions in real-time will provide additional support for various social and scientific domains. 
 These solutions can transform the nation’s capital into a smart and safe city in line with Transformasi Nasional (TN50) towards vibrant economic and societal development.

316977,Main,16,12/08/2021,Vietnam aims for AI glory,Minister unveils national strategies to achieve goal by 2030,"THE  government has issued a national strategy on the research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) till 2030 with a view to gradually turning Vietnam into an innovation and AI hub in Asean and the world.
 Minister of Science and Technology Bui The Duy said the strategy aims for Vietnam to be among four leading countries in Asean and 50 nations globally in terms of AI research, development and application by 2030; build 10 prestigious AI trademarks in the region; and develop three national big data and high-performance computing centres.
 By 2030, Vietnam will set up 50 interconnected open databases in economic sectors in service of the effort. 
 To such end, the country is fine-tuning legal documents  and creating a legal framework regarding AI, as well as promoting international cooperation in  the field. Further attention should be paid to human resources  training and building databases that are synchronous with computing infrastructure.
 Since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out nearly two years ago, the application of AI in healthcare in Vietnam has become a bright spot in the world. 
 AI has helped ease burdens on medical workers and anti-pandemic forces through tracing apps and epidemiological maps.
 The Hanoi University of Science and Technology officially debuted an international centre on AI under the model of a mixed international research centre.

313365,Lifestyle,4,02/08/2021,AI-enabled caregiving,,"As populations age, more and more people are asking how best to organise care for the elderly in future.
 Trained staff will be important, as will technology and innovation – which may include artificial intelligence (AI).
 Some people get fearful when talk turns to AI, a topic riddled with misconceptions.
 At the end of the day, what it means is the attempt to map human decisions using computers, says Andreas Hein, an expert in assistance systems at Oldenburg University in Germany.
 In a medicine or healthcare setting, that means providing doctors and nurses suggestions that a computer has created based on data. A person makes the final decision, says Hein.
 AI is already in use when it comes to outpatient care, for example in route planning, which takes patients’ travel times or preferences into account.
 For the last few years, AI has mainly been about ensuring that machines can learn, using data.
 No rules are defined in advance, they are extracted from the data, says Hein.For that to work, the data has to be good. That means you need to know the basis for the decisions and the decisions that were made on the basis of those, he says.
 That sounds complicated but Hein says this could apply in radiology, for example. You can train systems using archived computer tomography images and the diagnoses that were made using them.
 The only problem when it comes to nursing is that so far, that data does not exist yet, but is just in the process of being developed, Hein says.
 “Without data, there is no AI,” says Karin Wolf-Ostermann, a nursing scientist who heads a ­nursing care research department at a German university.
 In the future, documentation will be one of the major AI issues, according to Hein. Nursing staff spend 30% to 50% of their time on documentation.
 If that could be reduced somehow, it would free up time to help patients instead. “We believe that we will have to feed in even more data here to be able to support ­documentation with the help of AI,” Hein says.
 The fields where AI is applued in care are a real mix, according to Wolf-Ostermann, who lists ­monitoring care recipients’ health status or activities, alarm management and detecting falls, service and medicine planning.
 However, so far, there is very ­little large-scale use of AI in these areas.
 AI applications can also provide social support, interaction and helping people to be mentally and physically active. All that can be valuable when it comes for those with dementia, although it is also controversial from an ethical ­perspective, says Hein.
 The fear is that creature-like robots, for example, or other ­technical substitutes will reduce the amount of time that caregivers spend with dementia patients, who won’t get the attention and interaction they need.
 However, so far, studies show there have been positive effects in the short term, as long as the robots are well integrated into the patient’s daily care routine, says Hein.It is hard to imagine nursing today without technology, says Wolf-Ostermann. Nurses are generally very open to new technologies, she says, based on her own studies.
 Nursing should make active use of the scope for design by engaging in a broad discussion of technological innovation, and doing so in good time, she says.
 That debate needs to be open, with a view to looking at both the opportunities and the risks.
 People always need to be in focus, both researchers agree.
 “By no means can this be about replacing caregivers, but about supporting them,” says Wolf-Ostermann.
 You can’t replace social skills with AI, she says. – dpa",population age people care elderly future staff technology innovation artificial intelligence people fearful talk topic riddled misconception day map human decision computer expert assistance system university germany medicine healthcare doctor nurse suggestion computer data person final decision hein outpatient care route planning patient travel time preference machine data rule advance data hein data basis decision decision basis complicated hein radiology train system computer tomography diagnosis data process hein data karin wolf scientist head care department german university future documentation major issue nursing staff time documentation free time patient data support documentation hein field care real mix wolf ostermann care recipient health status activity management fall service medicine scale application social support interaction people active valuable dementia controversial ethical perspective hein fear creature robot technical substitute amount time caregiver dementia patient attention interaction study positive effect short term robot patient daily care routine hard imagine nursing technology wolf nurse technology study active scope design broad discussion technological innovation time debate view opportunity people researcher caregiver wolf ostermann social skill dpa,"[(0, 0.9947503)]",0
313381,Lifestyle,6,02/08/2021,Study: 44% of dating app users trust AI,,"The use of dating applications has become a very common tool in individuals’ quests for love and romance, no matter their demographic.
 Making connections thanks to algorithms is now part of the daily life of singles all over the world. So much so that 44% of dating app users trust artificial intelligence to find them the right person.
 According to the latest study “Love in an algorithmic age” from cybersecurity company Kaspersky, 44% of people using a dating app said they would trust the selections and matches of artificial intelligence (AI). For some users, algorithms are even more important, as dating apps make the process of dating easier for 54% of those surveyed.David Jacoby, a security researcher at Kaspersky, outlined that “results of our research show that many people positively perceive the introduction of AI into dating applications”. But what about the dating process and romantic relationships?
 “Algorithms may not be able to feel, but they make possible relationships that involve very personal qualities, such as empathy, openness, and emotional stability,” note therapists Birgitt Hölzel and Stefan Ruzas of Munich practice Liebling + Schatz.Conducted globally with 18,000 people across 27 countries, this study reveals how deeply entrenched dating apps are in our contemporary world and the recent transformations in how we find love.Multiple relationships – and more superficial onesWith dating possibilities coming to our smartphones and computers, potential exchanges are increased tenfold.
 Since the appearance of the first applications, the popularity of Tinder and other dating apps is beginning to have a fundamental impact on the very nature of human relationships. The study notes several trends in the era of algorithmic dating, including the decline of monogamy, and the perceived rise of ephemeral relationships.
 According to the study, 41% of respondents believe that dating apps have led to an increase in casual relationships, while 37% believe that people are more likely to talk to multiple potential partners at once.
 Nearly a third of those surveyed believe that people “will have more relationships in their lifetime” than they used to.
 And this increase in the number of relationships could also mean that many are short-lived, as access to multiple choices of potential partners translates into less engagement. Especially when more than a third of those surveyed predict that it will be easier to leave a relationship because of dating apps in the future.
 However, the study points out that the apps and all their possibilities only transform the search for true love and not true love itself.
 “At the same time, despite the benefits and possibilities of recommendation services, you should always be vigilant and remember that we cannot know for sure who is on the other side of the screen,” warns Jacoby. – AFP Relaxnews",application common tool individual quest romance matter demographic connection daily life single app user artificial intelligence person study algorithmic age cybersecurity company kaspersky people app trust selection artificial intelligence user apps process easier jacoby security researcher kaspersky people perceive introduction application process romantic relationship relationship personal quality empathy openness emotional stability note therapist lzel stefan ruzas munich practice schatz people country reveals apps contemporary transformation multiple relationship superficial oneswith possibility smartphones computer potential exchange tenfold appearance application popularity apps fundamental impact nature human relationship study note trend algorithmic decline monogamy rise ephemeral relationship study respondent apps increase casual relationship people multiple potential partner people relationship lifetime increase relationship short access multiple choice potential partner engagement easier relationship apps future study apps possibility search true love true love time benefit possibility recommendation service vigilant screen warns jacoby relaxnews,"[(5, 0.9936242)]",5
312569,Main,13,30/07/2021,PTPTN turning to AI for better service delivery,,"PETALING JAYA: The next five years will see the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) improving its digital and online services, including using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data.
 Its chairman Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said the work and management landscape of the public sector in delivering government services is moving towards digitisation.
 “In this regard, PTPTN remains committed and fully supports this aspiration by further strengthening our operations management, improving communication channels and improving online payment facilities to ensure service delivery to customers is not affected (by the pandemic),” he said during the virtual launch of the PTPTN Strategic Plan 2021-2025 yesterday.
 Among the online services offered by PTPTN are loan repayments, loan applications and applications for Skim Simpanan Pendidikan Nasional (SSPN) accounts, he added.
 Wan Saiful said to ensure more systematic data management, the corporation will strengthen its information management using an AI framework to analyse data and improve the capabilities of its ICT applications and hardware.
 “In line with the changing times, technological advances and economic climate change, PTPTN as the national higher education fund needs to transform to remain relevant and competitive in empowering the education sector and meeting the needs of society by providing the best services,” said Wan Saiful.
 The PTPTN Strategic Plan 2021-2025 will see the corporation work towards rebranding itself and remain relevant to those wanting  to pursue higher education, he added.
 The plan consists of five core strategies, with the first being to make its savings product, SSPN, the top education savings product in Malaysia.
 He added that as of May 31, a total of RM8.99bil has been deposited into more than 4.98 million SSPN accounts.
 The second is to become the leading education loan manager by empowering the management of the loan, he said.
 Since its inception in 1997, Wan Saiful said the corporation has disbursed RM63.82bil in education loans to more than 3.51 million students so they can pursue higher education.
 The third core strategy, he added, is to improve its loan repayment collection to make it more effective.
 The fourth core strategy will see the corporation implement funding and investment strategies that bring optimal returns.

310897,Lifestyle,3,26/07/2021,Could AI keep people ‘alive’ after death?,,"WHAT if Abraham Lincoln could address the US Congress today? Or your great grandmother could help run the family business?
 Researchers and entrepreneurs are starting to ponder how artificial intelligence (AI) could create versions of people after their deaths – not only as static replicas for the benefit of their loved ones but as evolving digital entities that may steer companies or influence world events.
 Numerous startups are already anticipating growing demand for digital personas, including Replika, an app that learns to replicate a person in the form of a chatbot, and HereAfter AI, which records people’s life stories and uses them to create a replica embedded in a smart speaker.
 Even Big Tech seems to acknowledge the potential: Microsoft recently patented a method of using chatbots to preserve historical figures and living people.
 A Microsoft spokeswoman says there is no plan to use it.
 Constructed from code 
 Digital personas take many forms, from chatbots to animatronic robots to moving projections that gesture and speak like the real thing.
 AI is usually central to building and training them to interact with people. 
 Already, hologram-like projections of dead musical artists, including Roy Orbison and Tupac Shakur, have performed on stage.
 In the Microsoft patent, two of the company’s inventors, Dustin Abramson and Joseph Johnson, describe a conversational chatbot that uses data from social media, voice recordings and writings “to train a chatbot to converse and interact in the personality of the specific person”.
 That person, the patent says, “may correspond to a past or present entity (or a version thereof), such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure”.
 The patent goes on to describe how the chatbot could mimic a person’s voice and interact using two- or three-dimensional images “to create a more realistic, human-like chat experience”.
 As digital personas get closer to the real thing, they may become able to learn and evolve beyond the originator’s death, adapting to new events as they happen.
 That would confer a kind of digital immortality – not only preserving a personality but allowing it to live on in virtual form.
 Such “immortal” personas could continue to interact with their families, friends and descendants long after their deaths, and inform historical and genealogical research.
 They could also be put to use aboard spacecraft exploring the universe, venturing further than any ordinary human could in a lifetime, says David Burden, an author and the chief executive of Daden, a Britain-based company that builds chatbots.
 Living people might use digital replicas of themselves that email and chat with colleagues to get more work done, or to take over while they are on vacation, Burden says.It is easy to foresee that advancing further.
 An Elon Musk-like executive might want to use a digital persona to manage a business after his death, Burden says.
 “People who have created organisations and businesses don’t really want to let go of the reins,” he says.
 “Why not just hand it over to some sort of construct that will continue to grow the business in line with their particular thought?”
 Are you your own person?
 As with many sci-fi visions of the future, there are downsides.
 Virtual personas, for one, are inherently imperfect because they are typically based on speech, writings, social media posts and other output that doesn’t necessarily capture the essence of a person.
 A digital persona constructed via AI has no consciousness.
 Society may have to wrestle with questions about who owns a dead person’s avatar and any income it produces.
 Should virtual personas have rights? And will their existence mean people can’t fully grieve the loss of friends and relatives who are preserved?
 Personas could also be created without the originator’s knowledge or permission, provided enough data exists in the public realm to train an AI model to mimic him or her.
 Historical figures could be “resurrected”, whether or not they would have liked to be.
 Good replicas of famous people or politicians could also allow them to exert influence over future events, shaping the world from beyond the grave.
 Davide Sisto, a philosopher at the University of Turin in Italy and an author who focuses on mortality in digital culture, says he hoped it wouldn’t be possible for a politician such as former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to have a virtual counterpart that continued to operate indefinitely in the public space after his death.
 In some ways, Sisto says, a digital ghost is just an extension of how people have sought to stay close or communicate with the dead through human history.
 “Whereas photographs could substitute the body of the dead in a static way, today digital technologies give motion and activity to this ‘eternal’ image,” he says.
 It will likely take a while before genuinely convincing replicas of people are all around us.
 Maggi Savin-Baden, a professor at the University of Worcester who co-wrote a book with Burden on digital immortality, had a persona modelled after herself made last year – an animated head and shoulders with speech output from a chatbot.
 She asked people from her professional world who didn’t know her to interact with it and then with her. Not everyone was fooled.
 “They said some of it felt really like me and some of it just didn’t at all,” Savin-Baden says.

308761,Lifestyle,4,19/07/2021,AI is the way forward,The Skymind Innovation City will power the AI applications of tomorrow.,"SKYMIND Future Cities executive director Eow Wan Lin said the company is currently in discussions with Johor to build Skymind Innovation City (SIC) for creating and testing artificial intelligence- powered technologies at Iskandar Malaysia.
 “Skymind Innovation City will create a platform for enterprises and industries to develop their own AI applications, and equip them with tools to be innovators in the industry by building a stronger AI ecosystem,” he said in a statement.
 He explained that SIC will focus on three main hubs: a Talent Hub for developing a skilled workforce in AI, an Innovation Hub for enabling AI innovators and a Regional R&D Hub for research and development of AI applications.
 Eow sees SIC as the company’s way of supporting Johor’s Digital Agenda and innovation programmes to develop a vibrant ecosystem for growth in the digital space.At the recent virtual World AI Conference Shanghai 2021, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad said a robust upskilling and reskilling programme will be set up to ensure that the state is on track to become an AI powerhouse. 
 Policies too will be established, he said, to forge partnerships with the private sector and to support innovation in AI.
 A Special Digital Economic Zone will be developed for companies to research and build smart solutions for manufacturing, he added.
 Eow said the announcement by Hasni shows support for the innovation economy, which has to be bolstered by government policies, technology and entrepreneurship.
 “These factors should be the main goal, along with developing effective private-public partnerships that spark increased innovation and productivity,” he said. 
 Nations such as South Korea and Taiwan which have invested a higher percentage of their GDP into innovation performed much better in terms of GDP per capita growth than countries that didn’t, he said, citing a report by The Conversation. 
 “South Korea was badly impacted by the economic slump in 1997. But today it is one of the most successful economies in the world. 
 “It has emerged as the most innovative country in the world, topping the 2021 Bloomberg Innovation Index released in February,” he said.  
 The country’s achievement is largely attributed to the commitment of South Korean businesses and the authorities in investing in the country’s future growth even when encountering tough headwinds at home and abroad, said Eow.  
 Malaysia currently ranks eighth in Asia and 33rd in the world in the Global Innovation Index 2020, he said, adding that it has the potential to improve by tapping into the AI revolution.  
 “Capital or investment in research and development will ensure that the country produces better products and services, and introduces new ones,” he said.
 He shared that Skymind’s mission is to enable and empower the development of AI applications in Malaysia with tools, support systems and investments.
 “To remain competitive in a world on the cusp of super connectivity, it’s crucial that Malaysia accelerates its capacity for innovation,” he said.
 He quoted the Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting The AI Revolution report by PwC, which predicted that AI will contribute US$15.7 trillion (RM65.9 trillion) to the global GDP by 2030.
 “In short, the impact of AI over the next decade will be monumental. It is imperative that Malaysia jumps onto the bandwagon,” he said.
 And the establishment of “innovation cities” would have a multiplier effect that would give AI companies greater reach into the region, said Eow, adding that Skymind wants to help Malaysia grow into an “AI nation”.",skymind future city director eow wan lin company discussion build skymind innovation city sic artificial intelligence technology malaysia skymind innovation city platform enterprise industry application tool innovator industry building stronger ecosystem statement sic focus main hub talent hub workforce innovation hub innovator regional hub development application sic company johor digital agenda innovation programme vibrant ecosystem growth digital space virtual conference shanghai johor mentri besar datuk hasni mohammad robust programme track powerhouse policy partnership private sector support innovation special digital economic zone company smart solution eow announcement hasni support innovation economy government policy technology entrepreneurship factor main goal effective private public partnership spark innovation productivity nation korea percentage gdp innovation term caput growth country report conversation korea impacted economic slump successful economy innovative country bloomberg innovation february country achievement commitment south korean business authority country future growth tough headwind malaysia rank eighth asia global innovation potential improve revolution capital investment development country product service introduces skymind mission enable empower development application malaysia support system investment competitive cusp super connectivity crucial malaysia capacity innovation global artificial intelligence study revolution report pwc contribute global gdp short impact decade monumental imperative malaysia jump establishment innovation city company region eow skymind malaysia grow nation,"[(3, 0.9953482)]",3

The AI system has been learning patterns of behaviour by analysing data from cameras, sensors, and the dispatch records of rescue services since April 2020, Seoul Institute of Technology said on Wednesday.
Based on information from hours of CCTV footage and assessing details such as the hesitation of the person, the AI can then forecast a hazardous situation and immediately alert rescue teams, principal researcher Kim Jun-chul said.
“The new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,” Kim Hyeong-gil, in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, said as he monitored real-time footage from bridges on Seoul’s Han River.
The technology will be piloting from October.
South Korea, with a population of 52 million people in 2019, recorded over 13,700 suicides the same year, government data showed.

company engineering solutions with reliable, cloud to edge computing. 
Collaboration with Innov8tif 
Assoc Prof Dr Wong Kok Sheik 
and Dr Ian Tan from the School of Information Technology are teaming up with Innov8tif and scholarship recipient Calvin Yap to work on this project. 
Still in its early stages, the project aims to develop an application to verify official documents that can help solve security problems. The idea was conceptualised based on the need for businesses to ensure that official documents and proof 
of identification are valid and not tampered with. 
The team is leveraging Innov8tif’s precision, experience and data as an industry leader to develop the best solution in ensuring the project’s success. 
Besides solving a real-world 
problem, Yap will have the opportunity to work with experts to hone 
his theoretical knowledge through the application while improving 
his understanding of how things work. 
“Through this research and 
development collaboration, we 
are taking progressive steps towards the vision of creating Innov8tif as a research-driven company, which can translate into scalable and competitive solutions for the industry. 
“We wish to form various 
collaboration models with universities to spur innovations while developing a pool of talents. It’s time to dream big and act now”, said Innov8tif chief executive officer George Lee.
This is an excellent 
opportunity for Monash University Malaysia to showcase its academic abilities in integrating theoretical knowledge 
with fundamental world skills. 
It also contributes towards enhancing AI adoption in Malaysia and solving existing problems. 
Collaboration with Intel Microelectronics 
Intel Malaysia aims to address any knowledge gaps present in its support platforms. Content 
on such platforms can generate valuable explicit and tacit knowledge bases, represented 
as domain-sensitive knowledge graphs. 
The resulting knowledge graphs could then be leveraged to provide quick, effective 
solutions by recognising 
similar problems and powering chatbots.
Knowledge extraction with AI 
is a challenging task within technical domains for even the most advanced NLP approaches, 
especially with the unstructured nature of content on support platforms. 
Dr Lim Wern Han and Dr Soon Lay Ki are hopeful that 
by working together, they can find a breakthrough by combining the School of Information Technology expertise in the area with the subject matter experts of Intel.
Through this collaboration, scholarship recipient Tan Kuok Xuen can evaluate the hypotheses on real-world support data provided by Intel under the close guidance of the subject matter experts and their team from 
various domains. If successful, it would be a robust solution with a global impact on an effective and efficient support system.

299717,Lifestyle,5,21/06/2021,Humans are ‘selfish’ around AIs,,"HUMANS don’t treat intelligent machines with respect or kindness and don’t feel bad about it, according to a new study that sheds light on humanity’s reluctance to reciprocate the help that artificial intelligence (AI) offers us.
The findings, published this month, are set to become increasingly relevant in a world where AI-operated cars, household machines and software will become more common.
While humans expect AI to be helpful, people are much less ready to reciprocate, and will instead exploit its benevolence to their own benefit, according to a new study from scientists at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and University of London.
The researchers gave the example of a driver who is given the choice of yielding to another car on the road. 
If the driver sees there is no human driving the car, then he or she will often not allow the car to pass ahead, the research suggests.
“If we realise that the robot in front of us will be cooperative no matter what, we will use it to our selfish interest,” says Prof Ophelia Deroy, a philosopher and senior author on the study.
“They are fine with letting the machine down,” says Dr Bahador Bahrami, a social neuroscientist at the LMU. 
“That is the big difference. People do not even report much guilt when they do.”
The team had investigated whether humans behave just as cooperatively when dealing with AI systems as they do with their fellow humans.
The results were sobering for the researchers: “People expected artificial agents to be as cooperative as fellow humans. 
“However, they did not return their benevolence as much and exploited the AI more than humans,” explains Jurgis Karpus, also from LMU.
This reluctance to cooperate with machines is a challenge for future interaction between humans and AI, the researchers say. – dpa",human treat intelligent machine kindness feel bad study shed light humanity reluctance artificial intelligence offer finding month relevant car household machine software common human helpful people ready exploit benevolence benefit study scientist maximilians universitaet lmu munich university london researcher choice yielding car road driver human driving car car pas realise robot front cooperative matter selfish prof senior author study fine machine bahador social neuroscientist lmu difference people team human system fellow human researcher people artificial agent cooperative fellow human benevolence human jurgis karpus lmu reluctance cooperate machine future interaction human researcher,"[(5, 0.98950696)]",5
296889,Lifestyle,5,14/06/2021,New AI to combat disinformation,,"DISINFORMATION campaigns are becoming increasingly frequent on social networks, especially in the run-up to elections. 
Such campaigns are capable of manipulating opinion, reinforcing conspiracy theories or even swaying elections.
To counter this new danger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of identifying fake news with great accuracy.
In an effort to clean up the Internet, a team of MIT researchers have launched a program called Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO). 
Their aim was to create a system capable of automatically detecting disinformation and the accounts that spread it. Its success rate is around 96%.
The project first originated in 2014, when the team was studying how social media could be exploited by malicious groups. 
As part of their work, the researchers noticed increased and unusual activity from accounts that appeared to be driving pro-Russian stories. 
As a result, the team decided to launch the program to study what kind of similar techniques might be used on social media during the 2017 French presidential elections.
In the 30 days leading up to the vote, the team compiled 28 million posts from more than one million accounts relating to the election. 
For example, the study detected a large rate of hostile accounts spreading fake news around the #macronleaks narrative.
The team of researchers also looked at the impact of disinformation messages. 
Using the RIO program, they were able to find out whether an account was contributing to the spread of fake news and what impact this had on the wider network. 
RIO also has the ability to help predict how different countermeasures might stop the spread of a given disinformation campaign.
New approach
Edward Kao, a member of the research team, told MIT News: “If you are trying to answer the question of who is influential on a social network, traditionally, people look at activity counts. What we found is that, in many cases this is not sufficient. It doesn’t actually tell you the impact of the accounts on the social network.”
To address this, Kao developed a statistical approach (as outlined in the study) to help determine whether an account is spreading disinformation and the extent to which the account causes the network, as a whole, to change and amplify the message.
The RIO system collects relevant data then identifies potential influence operation narratives, and classifies accounts based on their behaviour and content. 
It then builds a narrative network to estimate the impact of these accounts on spreading specific narratives across social media.
These hostile online influence operations, as described in the study, are facilitated by the relatively low cost, unbridled scalability and automation of a certain number of variables in the spread of disinformation on social media. 
It remains to be seen if and how this system can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news. – AFP/Relaxnews",disinformation campaign frequent social network election capable manipulating opinion conspiracy theory election massachusetts institute technology mit researcher artificial intelligence system capable fake news accuracy effort clean internet team mit researcher program reconnaissance influence operation aim create system capable disinformation account spread success rate project team social medium malicious researcher increased unusual activity account pro russian story team launch program study social medium french presidential election day vote team post account election study rate hostile account fake news narrative team researcher impact disinformation message program account spread fake news impact wider network rio ability countermeasure spread disinformation campaign approach edward kao team mit news answer question influential social network people activity sufficient impact account social network address kao statistical approach study determine account disinformation extent account network change amplify message rio system relevant data identifies potential influence operation narrative account behaviour content build narrative network estimate impact account specific narrative social medium hostile online influence operation low cost unbridled scalability automation variable disinformation social medium system control spread news afp relaxnews,"[(1, 0.99458826)]",1
286273,Lifestyle,4,17/05/2021,"AI AI, captain!",The first autonomous ship prepares for its maiden voyage.,"THE Mayflower 400 – the world’s first intelligent ship – bobs gently in a light swell as it stops its engines in Plymouth Sound, off England’s south-west coast, before self-activating a hydrophone designed to listen to whales.
The 50ft (15m) trimaran, which weighs nine tonnes and navigates with complete autonomy, is preparing for a transatlantic voyage.
On its journey, the vessel – covered in solar panels – will study marine pollution and analyse plastic in the water, as well as track aquatic mammals.
Eighty percent of the underwater world remains unexplored.
Brett Phaneuf, co-founder of the charity ProMare and the mastermind behind the Mayflower project, said the ocean exerts “the most powerful force” on the global climate.
Rosie Lickorish, a specialist in emerging technologies at IBM, one of the partners on the project, said the unmanned craft provided an advantage in the “unforgiving environment”.
“Having a ship without people on board allows scientists to expand the area they can observe,” she said.
A variety of technology and service providers have contributed to the project with hundreds of individuals involved from nations including India, Switzerland and the United States, said Phaneuf.
The project would have cost 10 times the roughly US$1mil (RM4.1mil) invested by ProMare without the global effort, he added.
Smart ship
The non-profit venture will offer the data gathered by the project free of charge. 
The information could be of particular use to the future of commercial shipping.
The autonomous ship is scheduled to embark this month if weather is favourable and permission is granted by British authorities.
The journey to Plymouth, Massachusetts – the same voyage made by pilgrims on the original Mayflower in 1620 as they sought a new life in America – will take three weeks.
While the pandemic has delayed the voyage of the Mayflower 400, Phaneuf said at least no one will fall ill on the trip.
“No one will get bored or tired or sick on this one. So it can take as long as it likes to do science,” he said from the British port.
Sitting alongside him were three computer technicians checking the equipment remotely.
Meirwen Jenking-Rees, a 21-year-old student engineer, checked the ship’s engines before it headed out for a sea trial.
Construction of the trimaran, which is automated from the robotic rudder that steers it to the diesel generator that supplements its solar power, took a year.
Developing its “smart captain”, the onboard artificial intelligence (AI), took even longer as the computer has had to learn how to identify maritime obstacles by analysing thousands of photographs.
A sea of data
The Mayflower 400 also had to be taught how to avoid collisions and first went to sea for “supervised learning”.
Robotics and software engineer Ollie Thompson said that by running a “number of scenarios” the ship can learn “what are good and bad actions, what is safe and what is not”.
So if it makes a mistake, the boat can correct itself “and then learn by itself”, he added.
The automated vessel uses its “eyes and ears” – a sophisticated system of six cameras and radar – to continue learning on its own.
Because of a lack of regulations around unmanned sailing, the Mayflower 400 is yet to be tested in rough seas or storms, a situation Jenking-Rees described as a “worst case scenario”.
In simulated settings, however, the craft has faced 50m waves.
Lickorish explained that the boat’s AI will be pivotal in conducting scientific experiments.
“It was trained with hundreds of hours of audio data,” she said, “to detect the presence of marine mammals, recognise the marine mammals, and actually tell us something about population distributions out in the open ocean.”
Analysing the chemical composition of the water, measuring sea levels and collecting samples of microplastics are the ship’s other missions.
Similar robotic data collection has been ongoing in space for decades.
While the ship is totally autonomous, the team will monitor the ship 24 hours a day from England, ready to intervene remotely in case of danger. – AFP",mayflower intelligent ship light swell engine sound south west coast hydrophone listen whale trimaran weighs tonne navigates complete autonomy transatlantic voyage journey vessel solar panel marine pollution analyse plastic water track aquatic mammal underwater unexplored brett phaneuf founder charity promare mastermind mayflower project ocean exerts powerful force global climate rosie lickorish specialist technology ibm partner project craft advantage unforgiving environment ship people board scientist variety technology service provider project hundred individual nation india switzerland phaneuf project cost time mil promare global effort smart ship profit venture data project free charge future commercial shipping autonomous ship embark month favourable permission british authority plymouth massachusetts voyage original mayflower life america week pandemic delayed voyage mayflower phaneuf fall trip tired sick like science british port computer technician equipment meirwen rees student engineer ship engine sea trial construction trimaran robotic rudder steer generator supplement solar power smart captain artificial intelligence computer learn maritime obstacle thousand photograph sea data mayflower taught avoid collision robotics software engineer thompson scenario ship bad action safe boat correct learn vessel eye ear sophisticated system camera lack regulation mayflower rough sea situation jenking rees scenario setting craft wave lickorish boat pivotal conducting scientific experiment hundred hour data presence marine mammal marine mammal population distribution chemical composition water sea level sample microplastics ship mission robotic data collection space decade autonomous team monitor ship hour day ready intervene danger afp,"[(2, 0.99597454)]",2
285083,StarBiz,10,12/05/2021,"IBM unveils new cloud, AI services to modernise business",,"NEW YORK: International Business Machines (IBM) Corp is rolling out a new product that will help businesses automate tasks, capitalising on the rise of chat bots and virtual assistants during the pandemic and taking another step in its pivot toward cloud services and artificial intelligence.
The tool, called Watson Orchestrate, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to select and sequence the prepackaged skills needed to perform a task across sales, human resources, or operations functions. 
It will be compatible with Slack Technologies Inc and email as well as connect to business applications like Salesforce.com Inc, SAP SE and Workday Inc. The product is expected to be available later this year.
“We will look back on this year and last as the moment the world entered the digital century in full force,” said chief executive officer Arvind Krishna in a statement. 
“In the same way that we electrified factories and machines in the past century, we will use hybrid cloud to infuse AI into software and systems in the 21st century.”
Watson Orchestrate is one of a slate of new offerings and initiatives IBM is unveiling at its annual Think Conference, where its evolution from century-old company into a modern enterprise will be on full display. 
The pandemic accelerated the adoption of cloud services, a trend Krishna has been keen to optimise since he took over as CEO last year, and as part of an effort to revive growth after years of shrinking revenue.
IBM is focusing on what it calls hybrid-cloud, which allows companies to use a combination of their own data centres and computing resources leased from others and accessed online. 
The strategy fuelled IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, a deal Krishna helped arrange, for about US$34bil (RM140bil). IBM is also betting that corporate users will adopt AI in more of their systems.
The Armonk, New York-based company partnered with Ernst & Young LLP to create a hub that will focus on offering regulatory compliance, digital trust and security services to financial services companies through IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. 
IBM is also adding an upgrade to its Cloud Pak for Data service that the company said will generate answers to queries eight-times faster, and it’s rolling out Project CodeNet, an open source dataset with millions of lines of code to speed up businesses applications of artificial intelligence.
The new offerings come on the heels of IBM introducing its two nanometre chip, which is the world’s smallest and first chip of that size. IBM is working closely with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Intel Corp to bring the chips to market, Krishna said on a call with journalists, adding that the ongoing semiconductor shortage is “very worrisome.”
IBM’s rivals, including Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google, have also been moving to expand the use of AI for cloud computing customers across a variety of industries. 
Microsoft, for example, introduced new tools last year for doctors to use chat bots to more easily communicate with patients. 
Google announced a tie-up in February with Ford Motor Co that will provide data analytics to the factory floor and let drivers use voice-recognition technology in their cars.

The close-ended fund, Amundi SMART 2025, which is exclusively distributed by HSBC Bank Malaysia, has been made available to sophisticated investors in Malaysia since April 27. The offer period will end on June 8. 
In a statement, Amundi said the AI boost would contribute to the fund’s overall potential total return by converting big data into investment insights to enhance performance.
Amundi SMART 2025 offers units in ringgit, Singapore dollar and US dollar, and are respectively priced at RM1, S$1 and US$1. It invests into the target fund, Amundi SMART Portfolio 2025, that is managed by Amundi Singapore Ltd.

284479,Lifestyle,4,10/05/2021,AI monitors trajectory of ocean waste,,"REAL-TIME monitoring of the millions of tonnes of plastic floating in the world’s oceans: this was the objective set by a team of American researchers, who have created a virtual tool to determine the trajectory of marine waste.
The research project, which has published results in the journal Frontiers In Marine Science, was coordinated by Eric Chassignet, the director of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (Coaps) and a professor at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University in the United States.
Christened World’s Ocean Litter, the tool developed by Chassignet and financed by the United Nations aims to measure the quantity of plastic decomposing in the world’s oceans and identify countries releasing waste and the countries where it may be washed up.
“Marine litter is found around the world, and we do not fully understand its impact on the ocean ecosystem or human health. 
“That’s why it’s important to learn more about this problem and develop effective ways to mitigate it,” points out Chassignet.
The computer model makes use of Coaps data to map the effects of currents on litter and predict where marine waste is likely to wash ashore.
“Knowing where the marine litter released into the ocean by a given country goes and the origin of the litter found on the coastline of a given country are important pieces of information for policymakers,” explains Chassignet.
Protecting Galapagos 
Another team of scientists in Europe have also made use of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a tool to predict where and when waste might wash up in the Galapagos Islands, which are home to multiple unique wildlife species and have been classed as a World Heritage Site by Unesco.
Directed by Stephanie Ypma 
of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the project was conducted in collaboration with 
the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht and the Galapagos Conservation Trust, a British conservation charity. 
The tool aims to predict where waste will arrive in the islands to target clean-up efforts in areas with heavier pollution that can be easily accessed.
Several parameters were incorporated into the design of this digital modelling tool, including ocean fluxes and the composition of plastic particles. 
Floating sensors with GPS 
were also used to measure the movement of water towards 
the islands. 
All of these elements were then combined with AI to create predictions, which will be announced this summer. – AFP Relaxnews",real time million tonne plastic ocean objective set team american researcher virtual tool determine trajectory marine waste project journal frontier science eric chassignet director center atmospheric prediction study professor department earth atmospheric science florida university christened ocean litter tool chassignet united nation measure quantity plastic ocean identify country waste country marine litter impact ocean ecosystem human health learn effective mitigate chassignet computer model coaps data map effect current marine waste wash marine litter ocean country litter coastline country piece policymakers explains galapagos team scientist artificial intelligence tool predict waste wash galapagos multiple unique wildlife specie heritage site unesco stephanie ypma utrecht university netherlands project collaboration institute marine atmospheric utrecht galapagos conservation trust british conservation charity tool waste arrive island clean effort heavier pollution parameter incorporated design digital modelling tool ocean flux composition plastic particle sensor gps measure movement water element create prediction summer afp relaxnews,"[(3, 0.9938513)]",3
281693,Lifestyle,5,03/05/2021,China develops highly accurate AI censor,,"A RESEARCH team in China claims to have developed a text censor that can filter “harmful information” on the Internet with unprecedented accuracy using artificial intelligence (AI).
Traditional machine censors rely mainly on keywords to do this and struggle to achieve 70% accuracy, while AI technology – which needs to be trained by humans – has taken that to about 80% in recent years.
The team from Shenyang Ligong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences say their AI technology does not need to be trained by humans and “outperforms other approaches” to achieve more than 91% accuracy.
It would be particularly useful to “identify and filter sensitive information from online news media”, lead researcher Li Shu and her colleagues wrote in a paper published in the Journal Of Chinese Computer Systems.
China has more than 900 million Internet users, more than any other country, and is building the world’s largest 5G network to boost data transfer speeds. 
But the Internet is tightly controlled, with many sites blocked including Google, Facebook, Twitter and some foreign news outlets – and much of the content on the sites that are available is banned.
Prohibited topics are wide- ranging – from pornography to cults, firearm use, terrorism and attacks on the Communist Party and its top leaders.
But identifying them is a challenge for computers. Chinese is one of the most complex languages in the world, with nearly 10,000 characters. 
And sensitive words – gun, for example – could get picked up in a non-sensitive context, triggering a false alarm, or illegal information could be posted online without the use of any sensitive words.
The Chinese government and tech companies have instead relied on a huge army of censors to manually vet online content, but it is too costly and inefficient to keep pace with the growth of information on the Internet and social media.
Li, an associate professor of computer science at Shenyang Ligong University, said the technology developed by her team could keep up with the fast-evolving language used online in China, with a powerful dictionary containing not only sensitive words but their changing forms.
She said it could also read between the lines when searching for illegal content that was hidden in a different context, increasing the ability to identify text that is written in a way to bypass machine censors. 
Many Internet users in China avoid using sensitive words and instead use homonyms or add hyphens between characters to confound the censors.
Part of the team’s text censor technology came from Google, Li said. 
In 2017, Google developed an open-source language model known as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, or BERT, to help its search engine better understand users’ search terms. 
BERT can read a word in different contexts – such as “running a business” versus “running a marathon” – as a result of reading huge text databases including the entire Wikipedia site.
But BERT is not a censor by design and cannot understand text longer than 512 words. 
To make it work, Li’s machine breaks a long text into segments, lets BERT read the shorter parts and uses another AI tool to combine the results and assess them using the most up-to-date dictionary.
China is investing heavily in AI and the technology is increasingly becoming part of everyday life in China – from e-commerce to public spaces where surveillance cameras are equipped with facial recognition, to military uses. – South China Morning Post",team china claim text censor harmful internet unprecedented accuracy artificial intelligence traditional machine censor keywords accuracy technology human team shenyang ligong university chinese academy science technology trained human approach accuracy sensitive online news medium researcher shu colleague paper journal chinese computer system internet user country largest network boost data transfer speed site google facebook twitter foreign news outlet site prohibited topic wide pornography cult firearm terrorism attack party top leader challenge computer chinese complex character sensitive gun sensitive context false alarm illegal online sensitive chinese government tech company huge army censor online content costly inefficient pace growth social medium associate professor computer science shenyang ligong university technology team language online china powerful dictionary sensitive changing form line illegal content hidden context ability text bypass machine censor user avoid sensitive homonym add character confound censor text censor technology google google source language bidirectional encoder representation transformer search engine understand user term word context business versus marathon huge text database entire wikipedia site bert censor design text machine break text segment read shorter tool combine ass dictionary china technology everyday life china public space surveillance camera facial recognition military south china morning post,"[(1, 0.6451525), (2, 0.35099092)]",1
274173,Main,11,12/04/2021,MAXIS 5G LEVERAGES ON AI FOR EFFECTIVE SECURITY,,"SURVEILLANCE or closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are so widespread nowadays that it certainly is an eye-opener to know that the technology dates as far back as World War II. 
Most commercial surveillance systems today involve CCTV cameras placed at strategic areas within business premises for safety mea­sures and to detect incidents.
In commercial settings, video footage is paramount to actively and remotely monitor, investigate suspicious occurrences and alert responders (security units or authorities of law) if threats are detected.
Video footage is also important during post-event investigations as it can be used as evidence when crime is involved.
However, monitoring video footage has its drawbacks, as even the most skillful surveillance officer could lose focus at the split second an event does occur due to distraction or the possibility that what was captured on camera is undetectable by the human eye.
As a result, most companies end up hiring extra manpower to 
monitor video feeds over long ­periods of time, which leads to time-consuming, inefficient management of labour, as well as routine fatigue.
For most companies, the problem involves infrastructure; the equipment in question is incompatible or outdated, producing poor video images that make effective monitoring a challenge.
5G-enabled Smart Security
Maxis’ Smart Security solution allows companies to leverage faster speeds that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) for more effective tracking.
AI-based solutions are able to detect objects in a consistent and accurate manner without human error. 
Using video surveillance, AI can learn to identify and differentiate between various objects on screen.
Maxis’ solution comprises an ecosystem of sensors and cameras, future-ready connectivity solutions, enabled by a cloud-delivered platform that provides a scalable approach to video management. 
According to an article by IFSEC Global, which provides information from the global fire safety and integrated security sectors, 5G is set to make a marked impact on the security industry. 
With download speeds that range from around 50Mbps to 1.8Gbps or more, a 3GB video file would only take just 30 seconds to download and stream a real-time Ultra HD video with no quality ­degradation or delay.
A 5G network can sustain millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices over a couple of kilometres with noticeably lower latency, at just 1-4 milliseconds (ms), compared to existing networks, which rate between 50-100ms.
It supports video quality as high as 8K in resolution, better real-time response and faster retrieval of data for analysis. 
With AI integrated, the system can overcome limitations in ­manual monitoring.
It can be taught to focus on certain items, analyse patterns, behaviours and gather characteristics, all of which are filed for security purposes and decision making.  
All of this can be triggered on a mobile app for the security task force to take prompt action. 
With such reductions, the solution complements human workforce and helps businesses to digitalise operations, improve efficiency as well as their productivity.
Updated legacy
As the second tallest building in Malaysia, Komtar has been home to Penang’s many governing bodies since its inception in 1986. 
When Maxis digitised Komtar security’s existing legacy system, it did so without having to overhaul the existing cameras and hardware. 
Until the end of June, a trial 5G smart surveillance system is placed – equipped with new analytics and detection methods. 
“Our smart security use case at Komtar is approved by MCMC as part of the 5GDP project,” said head of Maxis’ Enterprise Products, Selvakumar Rajasekaran.
“It is one of the many examples of how we are enabling the power of new technologies like 5G, AI and IoT to improve efficiencies and outcomes. 
“Maxis plays an important role in delivering the best in class IoT solutions to support the nation’s digital ambitions, along with a safer and greener society.”
The new system presents security level functions that enhance intrusion detection by detecting passers-by who exhibit suspicious behaviour in high-profile, sensitive areas. 
The system also focuses on 
suspicious objects for too long left in high traffic areas, to prevent potential disasters from occurring. 
The most crucial upgrade is the ability to alert security officers of detections, through a mobile device, which can quickly assess the situation and make important real-time decisions. 
The surveillance system also helps Komtar security officers manage visitor capacity using 
analytics that take a headcount of those entering and exiting the building, assuring the space needed for social distancing.
In addition, the system triggers alerts when a crowd forms at high traffic areas such as lifts or elevators, prompting security officers to enforce SOPs without additional manpower.
Secure future
Selvakumar added that 5G’s lower latency, improved speeds and reliability allow further new advancements – such as intelligent drones, augmented reality, virtual reality simulations for emergency situations and energy control sensors – to be installed.
“5G has the potential to accelerate digitalisation and automation across many industries in Malay­sia.
“In the future, there will be more new services that require massive connections such as smart cities, smart sensors or meters, industrial automation and control, critical communications and more,” he said.

271911,Lifestyle,5,05/04/2021,Regulate AI or risk ‘dehumanisation’ at work,,"BRITAIN must urgently regulate how companies use artificial intelligence (AI) at work, unions said, warning of widespread discrimination if the technology is left unchecked.
AI algorithms are increasingly used in the hiring, firing and daily decisions of work life but the law has not kept up, according to a report by Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC).
Cases include AI favouring men over women, penalising ethnic minorities and judging people by their facial expression.
AI can also make work more efficient, ensure staff are paid by performance rather than gender, and that people who operate heavy machinery do not get too tired at the wheel, experts say. 
“Used properly, AI can change the world of work for good. Used in the wrong way it can be exceptionally dangerous,” the report’s authors, employment rights lawyers Robin Allen and Dee Masters, said in a statement.
“There are clear red lines, which must not be crossed if work is not to become dehumanised,” the lawyers from AI Law Consultancy firm said, pointing to “huge gaps” in British law.
The government said it would ensure that regulations met the needs of new technology, and that an independent expert committee had been appointed to provide it with advice.
“AI should be used to support workers and wider society, making working lives easier and more efficient,” a government spokesman said in a statement.
The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the use of AI at work, according to the TUC, which brings together 48 unions representing more than five million workers in Britain.
In July, a survey of almost 10,000 businesses across 30 European countries found 42% used at least one AI technology and 18% had plans to adopt AI technologies in the next two years.
Decisions often taken by algorithms include selecting candidates for interview, performance ratings, shift allocation and redundancies, according to the TUC.
Yet, workers are often kept in the dark about algorithms’ role in decisions that affect them and often lack any way to challenge them, it said.
While AI can improve productivity, research shows some algorithms single out minorities for unfair treatment, it added.
In 2018, Amazon was forced to scrap an AI recruiting engine that was found to prefer men over women, and researchers have questioned the accuracy of software that analyses facial expressions to assess job candidates’ suitability for a role.
The TUC said employers should be made to consult unions before introducing AI systems affecting pay and other key work decisions – a step that experts say could benefit everyone.
“Technology moves so fast that trying to regulate it with a law, as such, will be nearly impossible,” said Jeremias Adams-Prassl, a University of Oxford researcher into tech at work.
“The key advantage of social dialogue ... is that it’s a super flexible approach.”
Other suggested reforms include giving workers the right to have humans review any decisions made by AI and to “switch off” from work with “communication free” zones in daily life.
“This is a fork in the road,” the TUC’s general secretary Frances O’Grady said in a statement.

266769,Lifestyle,3,22/03/2021,When AI gets incredibly creative,,"DALL-E – so-called in homage to Salvador Dali and Wall-E – is an artificial intelligence program from the American research lab, OpenAI, co-founded by Elon Musk. 
The program has been trained to generate an image from a text caption.
This neural network is capable of translating absurd concepts and of conceiving objects that don’t exist. 
It could prove a major boon for the future of design, potentially exceeding the limits of our imagination.
If you talk about flowers in a text, Dall-E will create pictures of flowers. These flowers may be inspired by reality, but won’t necessarily be copies. In fact, this AI program produces its own graphic worlds ...
Dall-E makes use of the GPT-3 language model, which, in its full version, has a capacity of over 175 billion parameters. 
It is the largest language model in history, easily outstripping the 17 billion parameters of the former largest, Microsoft’s Turing NLG. Dall-E draws on a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 to form and generate images based on text descriptions. 
The model is capable of translating absurd concepts or conceiving objects that don’t exist.
The impact of Dall-E on creative industries could provoke a major shake-up for professionals in the sector. This potential could be so enormous that it is also raising questions. 
What about illustrators, designers and other kinds of artists, for example? A content-generating model can offer various propositions in a flash, leaving humans unable to keep pace.
A tool to be honed
Conscious of the potential consequences of Dall-E, OpenAI does not envisage making its product commercially available for the time being. 
On the one hand, the program isn’t yet ready. On the other hand, even if artificial intelligence offers a formidable lever for amplifying progress, it is still often viewed as dangerous. 
Based on human data and the Internet – potentially biased data – artificial intelligence inevitably suffers the bias of algorithms.
More precisely, the module is trained each time that it is used, making use of information it can find in its billions of parameters. 
Forms of bias therefore emerge as the structural reflection of our society, like discrimination based on skin colour, gender, nationality or religion. 
Such essential ethical issues will need to be addressed before unleashing this kind of artificial intelligence on the creative industry.
Now, OpenAI hopes to continue developing the program which, it admits, is not yet sufficiently honed. 
And it’s true that while certain images generated by the AI are seriously impressive, much still needs more work. 
Note that OpenAI is set to reveal more information about the program in an upcoming research paper. – AFP Relaxnews",dall homage salvador dali wall artificial intelligence program american lab openai elon musk program generate image text caption neural network capable absurd concept object major boon future design limit imagination talk flower dall create picture flower inspired reality copy program produce graphic world gpt language model version capacity parameter largest language model history parameter largest microsoft nlg dall draw parameter version gpt form generate image text description model capable absurd concept object dall creative industry major shake professional sector potential enormous question illustrator designer kind artist model offer proposition human unable pace tool conscious potential consequence openai envisage product time hand program ready hand artificial intelligence offer formidable lever progress dangerous human data internet data artificial intelligence bias algorithm trained time billion parameter form emerge structural reflection society discrimination colour gender nationality religion essential ethical issue unleashing artificial intelligence creative industry hope program admits true image impressive note openai reveal program upcoming paper afp relaxnews,"[(2, 0.9942229)]",2
264183,StarBiz,9,15/03/2021,Alibaba-backed AI startup Megvii files for IPO in Shanghai,,"BEIJING: Megvii Technology Ltd is poised to become the first major Chinese artificial intelligence startup to go public after it filed for a Chinese Depositary Receipt offering on Shanghai’s Star board.
The startup, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, plans to issue up to 253 million Class B shares as the underlying stock for the CDR offering, according to its prospectus. The offering may raise at least 6 billion yuan (US$922mil or RM3.79bil) after fees, which will be used to fund research and development in robotics and visual Internet of Things as well as to replenish capital, the filing shows. Citic Securities Co is the sponsor of the listing.
Megvii is one of the world’s largest AI startups, specialising in areas such as facial recognition. 
The eight-year-old firm gained fame in part because of China’s obsession with security, which in turn drove a nationwide video-surveillance boom. It registered a loss of 1.03 billion yuan, excluding one-time items, in the first nine months of 2020, according to its prospectus.
The company’s application for a Hong Kong listing about two years ago lapsed after it become one of several Chinese companies the Trump administration blacklisted over alleged involvement in human rights violations. 
It now joins Lenovo Group Ltd in taking advantage of the CDR programme Beijing kicked off three years ago to lure promising startups and big names to mainland bourses.
Proceeds from the listing will be used to beef up areas including research and production capacity, the company said in an emailed statement.

262091,Lifestyle,6,08/03/2021,Fighting food waste with AI,Japanese companies leverage artificial intelligence and big data in battle against food waste.,"JAPANESE companies are ramping up the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technology to reduce waste and cut costs in the pandemic, and looking to score some sustainability points along the way.
Disposing of Japan’s more than six million tonnes in food waste costs the world’s No. 3 economy some 2 trillion yen (RM76bil) a year, government data shows. 
With the highest food waste per capita in Asia, Japan has enacted a new law to halve such costs by 2030, pushing companies to find solutions.
Convenience store chain Lawson has started using AI from US firm DataRobot, which estimates how much product on shelves, from onigiri rice balls to egg and tuna sandwiches, may go unsold or fall short of demand.
Lawson aims to bring down overstock by 30% in places where it has been rolled out, and wants to halve food waste at all of its stores in 2030 compared with 2018.
Disposal of food waste is the biggest cost for Lawson’s franchise owners after labour costs.
Drinks maker Suntory Beverage & Food is experimenting with another AI product from Fujitsu to try to determine if goods such as bottles of oolong tea and mineral water have been damaged in shipping.
Until now, that’s been a time-consuming human endeavour. With the new AI, Suntory hopes to gauge when a damaged box is just that, or when the contents themselves have been damaged and need to be returned.
Suntory aims to reduce the return of goods by 30% to 50% and cut the cost of food waste and develop a common standard system that can be shared by other food makers and shipping firms.Sustainable goals
Japan’s notoriously fussy shoppers are showing signs of getting on board, especially as the coronavirus pandemic hits incomes.
Tatsuya Sekito launched Kuradashi, an e-commerce firm dealing in unsold foods at a discount, in 2014 after seeing massive amounts of waste from food processors while working for a Japanese trading firm in China.
The online business is now thriving due partly to a jump in demand for low-priced unsold foods as consumers became more cost conscious amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Sales grew 2.5 times last year from a year before, while the amount of food waste has doubled since the coronavirus cut off the food supply chain,” said Sekito.
Kuradashi has a network of 800 companies, including Meiji Holdings, Kagome and Lotte Foods, selling about 50,000 items including packs of instant curry, smoothies and high-quality nori.
“Japanese shoppers tend to be picky but we attract customers by offering not just a sale but a chance to donate a portion of purchases to a charity, raising awareness about social issues,” Sekito said.
Membership numbers jumped to 180,000 in 2021 from 80,000 in 2019.
Others have also joined forces with food firms in developing new technological platforms to cut food waste as part of global efforts to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs).
NEC is using AI that can not only analyse data such as weather, calendar and customers’ trends in estimating demand but also give reasoning behind its analysis.
The company has deployed the technology to some major retailers and food makers, helping them reduce costs by 15% to 75%.
NEC hopes to share and process data through a common platform among makers, retailers and logistics, to reduce mismatches in supply chains.
“Reducing food waste is not our ultimate goal,” said Ryoichi Morita, senior manager overseeing NEC’s digital integration.
“Eventually, we hope it can lead to resolve other business challenges such as minimising costs, fixing labour shortages, streamlining inventory, orders and logistics.” – Reuters",japanese company artificial intelligence technology waste cut cost score sustainability japan tonne food waste cost economy yen bil government data food waste caput asia japan law halve cost company solution convenience store chain lawson firm datarobot estimate product shelf onigiri rice ball tuna sandwich unsold fall short demand lawson halve food waste store disposal food waste biggest cost lawson franchise owner cost drink maker suntory beverage food product fujitsu determine bottle tea mineral water shipping time human endeavour suntory gauge box content suntory aim return cut cost food waste common standard system food maker firm sustainable goal fussy shopper sign board pandemic hit income kuradashi commerce firm unsold food discount massive amount waste food processor japanese trading firm online business jump demand low unsold food consumer conscious covid pandemic sale time food waste coronavirus cut food supply chain sekito kuradashi network company meiji holding lotte food item pack instant curry smoothy nori japanese shopper picky attract customer sale chance donate portion purchase charity awareness social issue membership joined force food firm technological platform food waste global effort sustainable development goal nec analyse data weather calendar customer demand analysis company technology major retailer food maker cost share process data common platform maker retailer logistics mismatch supply chain food waste ultimate goal ryoichi senior manager nec digital integration lead resolve business challenge cost labour shortage inventory logistics reuters,"[(3, 0.6951357), (4, 0.30150786)]",3
261793,Lifestyle,14,07/03/2021,Artificial intelligence and love,"Kazuo Ishiguro talks about Klara And The Sun, his first novel in six years.","“THE paradox is that you can create quite a lot of emotion, when you have a voice that isn’t inclined to express emotion.”
Kazuo Ishiguro, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist whose works include The Remains Of The Day and Never Let Me Go, could be talking about a number of his characters, but in this case he’s describing the main character in his new novel Klara And The Sun.
Klara, the book’s first-person narrator, is not actually a person but an AF - an Artificial Friend, for sale in a shop window in a not-too-distant future society. She sits, hoping for sunlight and for a child to catch her eye and, maybe, take her home. This happens, eventually, and Klara And The Sun becomes a poignant, unexpected story about love.
Kazuo’s first novel in six years, Klara And The Sun is one of the most anticipated books of the season, from an author who has spent four decades exploring language and emotion through his elegantly restrained fiction.
Born in Japan, he has lived in England since moving there with his family at the age of five, and published his first novel, A Pale View Of Hills,  in 1982. Numerous awards and accolades have followed, including the Nobel Prize for literature in 2017 and a British knighthood (for “services to literature” in 2019; he’s now officially Sir Kazuo).
Speaking on the phone from his London home in a relaxed, chatty interview, Kazuo acknowledged that Klara And The Sun is a companion piece, or “almost like a reply, emotionally,” to Never Let Me Go,  which also takes place in a future world and whose characters have a similar disconnection with humanity.
But it didn’t start out that way.
“Klara’s genesis is more like a doll or a soft toy, in one of those stories for five or six-year-olds,” he said, noting that he’d always loved how books for small children create a connection between text and illustrations.
“A lot of the atmosphere I put into the novel - obviously I’m writing entirely prose, but I wanted some of the atmosphere of those illustrations,” he said.
“One of the things I find really poignant about those children’s books - you sense in them our need to keep children of that age sheltered, from the harsh realities of what’s in front of them. We are trying to say, both in the words and the pictures, that the world is a kind, smiling place, it’s nice and gentle.
“And yet, when you look at a lot of those drawings, you can see that we don’t want to deceive the children. There are these subtle hints about difficulties, the sadness they might encounter... A lot of that was at the start of ‘Klara.’”
Kazuo has long been interested in characters who feel more than they can express: Mr Stevens, the stoic, loyal butler in The Remains Of The Day showed us his heart, but never through his words. Klara, the author thought, would offer an interesting challenge: an artificial creature, but one who is bright and observant and fascinated by the world.
“One of the opportunities I realised that I had, having a central character like Karla, is that coexisting in the same character can be this great naiveté and the kind of piercing sophistication in terms of what she’s learned about,” he said. Neither child nor adult, she nonetheless has a life span (Artificial Friends, like any technology, can become obsolete).
“My hope was that readers would find her quite touching, even though they know that she is not human, because she keeps mirroring aspects of human experience.”
He found that he could very quickly imagine what Klara’s voice sounded like, and could write for it.
“Usually I get to that point quite fast, where I don’t have to think very consciously about the voice... It’s like I can think in that voice. I’ve really done that with all my first-person narrators. I’m never really aware of stopping and thinking, ‘How would this character phrase this?’”
Though Klara And The Sun was finished a few months before the pandemic hit, Kazuo’s been trying to keep busy during months of lockdown with several projects. He’s writing an English-language adapted screenplay of the 1952 Akira Kurosawa film Ikiru,  about a Tokyo civil servant (“I’ve always found it a very moving film, and I always thought it could transfer very well to Britain in the 1950s”); he writes songs in collaboration with British musician Jim Tomlinson; and he and his wife, Lorna, have been reading “long things that we haven’t read in a long time.”
Among those: War And Peace,  which he found not entirely satisfying on second read, though “obviously, it’s still pretty good.” He’s pondering his next novel, possibly about “Europe, and buried memories.”
And he’s thinking about science fiction - what it was, and what it is - as the question keeps coming up when he discusses Klara And The Sun.“The role of science in our lives has changed spectacularly, just in the last 20 years or so,” he said. “And along with that, I think this label ‘science fiction’ has come to stand for something quite different these days.”
He described how, until recent years,”science was this thing that was just for people who were interested in it,” but now, as we all breathlessly await news in coronavirus research and climate change,”not to be concerned about science at some level, in our writing and in our thinking, now seems comparable to not being interested in politics. It just seems like such a huge hunk of where we are, as a civilisation at the moment, that you’re missing if you don’t pay attention.
“All those old genre labels are a little bit outdated now. I’m very happy for it to be called science fiction, but in a way, I think science fiction is now far more mainstream. Science fiction is fiction these days.” — dpa",paradox create lot emotion voice express emotion kazuo ishiguro nobel prize novelist day character main character klara sun book person narrator person artificial friend sale shop window distant future society sunlight child catch eye klara sun poignant story love kazuo klara sun book season author decade language emotion fiction japan family age pale view hill numerous award accolade nobel prize literature british knighthood service literature sir kazuo phone london chatty interview kazuo klara sun companion piece reply future character humanity genesis doll soft toy story book child connection text illustration lot prose atmosphere illustration child book child age harsh reality front picture nice gentle lot drawing deceive child subtle hint difficulty encounter lot kazuo character stevens loyal butler day heart klara author offer artificial creature observant fascinated opportunity central character karla character naivet sophistication term child adult life artificial friend technology obsolete hope reader human aspect human experience imagine klara voice write voice voice person narrator thinking character phrase klara sun month pandemic kazuo busy month lockdown project english language screenplay akira kurosawa film ikiru tokyo civil servant film transfer britain song collaboration british musician jim tomlinson wife lorna read time war peace read europe memory science fiction question discus sun role science life label science fiction day science people news coronavirus climate change science level comparable politics huge hunk civilisation moment pay attention genre label happy science fiction science fiction mainstream science fiction fiction day,"[(3, 0.9959971)]",3
259765,Lifestyle,3,01/03/2021,China hits the gas on AI driving lessons,,"FOR some students at Chinese driving schools, learning to drive is pretty similar to playing a video game.
At the Guangshen Driving Training Group, one of the biggest driving training schools in the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, students check in for practice sessions by scanning a QR code.
Sitting in simulators that resemble old-school racing game arcade cabinets, they navigate realistic 3D simulations of a driving test centre environment – complete with roads, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and even trees and buildings – on large curved screens.
The self-developed artificial intelligence (AI) project, called Lazy Cat, was launched in June last year. 
Based on data collected from real test cars, the simulation customises training plans based on users’ performance at each session. Users can also simulate driving along different routes and under various weather conditions.
“We are using technologies to transform traditional training methods, save energy and cut costs in fuel, labour and rent,” said Guangshen general manager Li Zhen.
Guangshen is one of several schools in China’s driver training industry – which was worth 140bil yuan (RM87.5bil) in 2019, according to the China Highway and Transportation Society – to embrace AI recently.
“Driver training used to be a very traditional industry with not much technology involved,” said Guangshen marketing manager Liu Chuhua. “Now, (AI driver training) is basically a countrywide trend.”
Another driving school in Shenzhen, Carshow Driving Training School, has nine AI-powered learning centres in different areas of the city. 
In September, the company launched an updated version of its simulated cars and robotic driving instructors, or “robocoaches”. 
So far, over 5,000 people have graduated from the company’s AI classes, according to local state-owned media Nanfang Daily.
Shanghai-listed Eastern Pioneer Driving School launched an intelligent driving training demonstration based in southwestern China’s Yunnan province in July. The company combined intelligent simulators with VR headsets to offer an immersive learning experience for the demonstration.
“Doing basic training ... via 4D and VR simulators not only reduces the time for real car training and fuel emissions ... but also reduces the operating costs of the entire driving training industry and improves its competitiveness,” Chen Jianyun, the general manager of Eastern Pioneer Driving School, said in a statement on the company’s website.
It is not a coincidence that many of these futuristic driving centres are in city centres, where there is a high population density increasing the potential customer base, but also high rents.
“It is not possible now to open (traditional) training venues in the centre of the city as there is no such big empty space in the city centre,” Li said. 
“Even if there is, the rent would be extremely high.”
Rent for land in Shenzhen suburbs has increased from about 10 yuan (RM6.25) per square metre per month a few years ago to about 20 to 30 yuan (RM12.50 to RM18.75) per square metre per month now, she said.
According to Li, about 20 training cars can be used in a 3,000sq m traditional driving centre, whereas Guangshen can fit more than 60 AI driving simulators in several hundred square metres of space, making the hi-tech option much more cost-effective.
Savings in labour and equipment costs are also reasons behind Guangshen’s recent focus on Lazy Cat, Li said. 
The simulators cost about 30,000 yuan (RM18,750) to 40,000 yuan (RM25,000) each compared with training cars, which cost around 120,000 yuan (RM75,000), not counting fuel costs. 
In addition, two or three employees can staff 14 simulators at the same time, whereas a traditional driving school would need to match the number of driving instructors to its vehicles.
While this saves driving centre operators money, the impact on instructors may not be so positive.
“AI-backed software and devices will give users a better experience, and it’s a good marketing tool for driver training companies,” said Sun Mingchun, chief economist of Haitong International Securities Group. 
“However, this might threaten the livelihood of driving instructors.”
“All driving instructors are very resistant to the AI project because it will replace them,” Li said. 
“This is the biggest challenge in the industry, but the advancement of technology is something no one can stop, and it’s not just us who are doing this.”
To be sure, aspiring drivers will still have to practise with real cars before taking their driving tests.
In China, they have to go through four exams before qualifying for a driving licence – two theory tests about traffic rules, basic concepts on vehicles and correct driving habits; one parking and basic driving skills test on a track; and a road test.
Ding Haifeng, one of Lazy Cat’s thousand or so students, said he spent two hours training with the simulator and another 10 hours in a real car before he passed the parking and basic skills test. 
He is now practising with the AI simulator again in preparation for the road test.
“I feel it’s exactly like a real car. There is no difference – clutch, throttle, foot brake, hand brake, everything is the same,” the 41-year-old renovation worker said. 
“The only bad thing is that when I stare at the screen for a long time, my eyes will be a little tired.”
Guangshen has ambitions to increase the percentage of its students taking AI-aided classes from fewer than 10% to more than 50% by this year, Li said.
The passing rates for Guangshen students using the AI simulators and those who go through only traditional classes in real cars are currently about the same, Li said. She added that she was confident the passing rates for AI-aided students will surpass those following the traditional route over time as the company upgrades its software and technology.
Li said Guangshen is looking into developing robocoaches, which are teaching systems integrated into real cars that can monitor students’ driving and give them feedback and instructions. 
In 2019, Beijing Yi Jia Jia Technology rolled out such a system in almost 30 driving schools across China.
“With intelligent simulators plus robocoaches, we want to standardise the learning process,” Li said, adding that human instructors are more likely to have varying standards.
As the technology develops, the impact for traditional driving schools could be “huge”, Sun said.
“Traditional driving training companies have their advantages, but they can be easily replaced by new technologies. If they do not embrace new technologies (like AI), they are likely to be eliminated.” – South China Morning Post",student chinese school drive pretty video game guangshen biggest training school southern chinese tech hub shenzhen student practice session code simulator resemble school game arcade cabinet realistic simulation test centre environment complete road traffic light pedestrian crossing tree building screen artificial intelligence project lazy cat june data real test car simulation plan user performance session user route condition technology traditional training method energy cut cost labour rent guangshen manager zhen guangshen school industry worth yuan china highway transportation society embrace traditional industry technology guangshen marketing manager liu chuhua driver training countrywide trend school shenzhen carshow school learning centre city company updated version car robotic instructor robocoaches people company local medium nanfang daily shanghai eastern pioneer school intelligent demonstration southwestern china province july company intelligent simulator headset immersive learning experience demonstration basic training simulator reduces time real car training fuel emission reduces cost entire training industry competitiveness chen jianyun manager eastern pioneer school statement company website coincidence futuristic driving centre city population density potential customer base traditional training venue city empty space city centre rent rent land shenzhen suburb yuan square month yuan square metre month car traditional driving centre guangshen fit simulator square metre space tech option cost effective saving equipment cost reason lazy cat simulator yuan yuan training car yuan fuel cost addition employee staff simulator time traditional driving school match instructor vehicle save centre operator money impact instructor positive software device user tool training company mingchun chief economist haitong international security livelihood driving instructor instructor resistant project biggest challenge industry advancement technology driver real car test exam licence theory test traffic rule basic concept vehicle habit basic driving skill track road test haifeng lazy cat student spent hour simulator hour real car basic skill simulator preparation road test feel real car difference clutch throttle foot brake hand renovation worker bad stare screen time eye guangshen ambition increase percentage student aided class fewer passing rate student simulator traditional class real car confident passing rate aided student traditional route time company upgrade software technology guangshen robocoaches system real car student feedback instruction jia jia technology system driving school intelligent simulator standardise learning process human instructor standard technology impact traditional driving school huge sun traditional training company technology technology south china morning post,"[(2, 0.9975471)]",2

253169,StarBiz,10,11/02/2021,More help for AI startups key to sector prospects,,"BEIJING: Since 2014, China has had the fastest growth of investment in startups in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector worldwide. Yet, more institutional efforts are needed to ensure more robust and high-quality development of the sector, according to a recent report.
A research report on the country’s AI industry for 2020, jointly released by Xu Chenggang, visiting professor at the London School of Economics, and a research team from Wuhan University, said that the average amount of equity investment for AI startups in seed stage in China hit US$60mil by 2018.
The growth of such investment in China surged since 2014, yet the number of AI startups in China is relatively small.
The report compares China’s AI development with that of other countries regarding the number of startups and the amount of investment received by these companies, progress in AI academic research and the application of open-source software.
Research results show that despite being the largest category of total investment, the number of externally funded AI startups in China is smaller than that of the United States and the United Kingdom.
Financing for AI startups relies heavily on an open economy. 
The report said that 46.5% of equity investment in this area comes from foreign capital and 14.4% from joint investment. 
Over 67.4% of these Chinese startups have gained their financing from independent venture capital firms.
Drawing comparisons between a number of countries, the report said that since 2015, large investments have been made in China targeting a relatively small number of AI startups, meaning that average financing levels for each startup are higher than that in many economies, including the US and the UK.
Xu said such a phenomenon is worth paying attention to.
“AI is a relatively new industry with many uncertainties, thus the number of startup firms in this industry at this stage is key to the process of selecting those that are superior and eliminating the inferior ones,” he said, adding that high-quality growth of the AI industry is of key significance in this round of industrial revolution.
Noting that the AI industry is of critical importance in the fourth industrial revolution, during which China and the world are experiencing tremendous change, Xu said that breakthroughs and progress brought by the growth of AI also have high degrees of uncertainty. 
Future success will emerge among the vast fledgling AI startups, and this is why the number of new startups in the sector is key.
The report also said that since 2017, China has been narrowing the gap between itself and developed economies, in terms of the number of published AI journals and conference papers. — China Daily/ANN",china fastest growth investment artificial intelligence sector institutional effort robust quality development sector report report country industry chenggang professor london school economics team university average amount equity investment startup seed stage china mil growth investment china startup report china development country amount investment company academic application source software largest category total investment startup united united kingdom financing startup economy report equity investment foreign capital joint investment chinese startup financing independent venture capital firm comparison country report investment startup average financing level economy phenomenon attention industry uncertainty firm industry stage key process superior inferior quality growth industry key significance round industrial revolution industry critical fourth industrial revolution china tremendous change progress growth degree uncertainty future success emerge vast fledgling startup sector key report china gap economy term journal conference paper daily ann,"[(3, 0.35181656), (6, 0.6424916)]",6
252375,Lifestyle,4,08/02/2021,Global plan to promote ethical AI,,"FROM reducing bias in product design to tackling racial injustice, more than 100 businesses, governments and non-profits launched a global initiative to make artificial intelligence (AI) more ethical and transparent.
The Global AI Action Alliance will identify tools and best practices to safely and ethically use AI, which is projected to contribute more than US$14 trillion (RM56.8 trillion) to the global economy by 2035.
“AI holds the potential to deliver enormous benefits to society, but only if it is used responsibly,” said Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF), in a statement.
In the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, for example, architects are planning an AI-run development that will be lined with sensors and WiFi-connected devices to gather data on everything from weather and pollution to people’s eating habits.
But while AI has unleashed a wave of opportunities from tackling diseases to improving transport, it has stirred controversy over facial recognition, automated 
decision-making and Covid-19 tracking, the WEF said at its virtual Davos, Switzerland, meeting.
Rights activists point to the criminal justice system as one area where marginalised communities have been discriminated against by the use of facial recognition and algorithms.
The global alliance, which will be led by technology company IBM and data philanthropy Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, among others, will focus on educating governments, industry groups and building public trust in AI.
This will include pushing for responsible product design, reducing AI bias, ensuring underserved groups benefit, and increasing access to justice as AI is woven into judicial systems, the WEF said.
In a virtual WEF panel, pop star and entrepreneur will.i.am emphasised the need to ensure children and adolescents are equitably considered and protected as AI grows across the planet.

243447,StarEdu,7,17/01/2021,The dark side of AI,"Technology enlightens, but it also gives rise to critical questions about the relationship between humans and humanoids","WE are now experiencing a new era. The 4.0 Industrial Revolution has created the momentum for fundamental changes in all aspects of our socio-economic and personal lives. 
The pandemic accelerates many of these changes. One theme that has emerged is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in society and, in particular, its impact on education. 
In simple language, AI refers to any device with varying levels of human intelligence. At an elementary level, the device may just automate routine tasks. It can be improved with assisted intelligence to make decisions and perform tasks. 
It can also be further improved with augmented intelligence to become a human decision making automation. 
One notch up is autonomous intelligence which is capable of adapting and acting without human assistance. Humans can use AI, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to improve all aspects of our lives. In sum, ML is an approach to achieve AI, and DL is a technique for implementing ML. 
So, how does AI facilitate the education process? AI helps by facilitating accessing, scaffolding, scaling, and accelerating education development. It provides the functional efficiency in managing learning systems.
AI can help to design intelligent tutoring systems with smart content to achieve smart outcomes. At the same time, it facilitates the development of individualised and personalised learning that is supported by learning analytics. Learning can be cumulative as it can be done in bytes. This creates scalable globalised learning. 
However, introducing AI into the classroom is more than a technology issue. There are challenges revolving around the integration and immersion of AI into the classroom culture. 
Using AI means interfacing the learning and teaching pedagogy into a new context that teachers must learn to be adept at. It is a sociological issue concerning a community of teachers, designers and learners. 
As the student-teacher relationship is a sensitive one, whether or not the use of AI technology is successful depends on the ability of teachers to create a suitable environment for it to take off. 
Teachers must thus learn to interpret technology as a social construct in the classroom culture. As AI is just a platform, teachers must engage students to use reflexive conversations in subject-specific and learner-specific contexts. In such situations they must anticipate the positive outcomes and other unintended effects.
Without a doubt, AI would facilitate management and functional efficiencies and help to reduce the cost of delivering quality education on a larger scale. This way, teachers are released from doing routine chores and can thus spend their precious time on other meaningful tasks.
We teach AI as a competency to solve problems. In China, they start teaching AI to five-year old children. These children grow to be AI-driven students and later, adults.
But the bigger question is how does AI impact such individuals and society at large? This concerns the critical interrogation of the ethical and sociological impact on individuals and mankind.
AI will continue its technological evolution in an inexorable growth.  Society will have to co-exist with humanoids as technology continues its triumphal march. But as much as AI enlightens, it also creates dark uncertainties.
Some critical classroom questions concern the relationship between humans and humanoids. As education is an emancipatory process and experience, what and how can it enlighten students and society about many unasked questions? Is the use of AI optional or obligatory? Should it be forbidden in some cases and for some areas? If education is to liberate us from ignorance and prejudices, then the teaching of AI should not be all about its functionality. 
How does AI help us to emote and empathise, decide right from wrong, nurture creativity and compassion? How do we ensure it does not deform the natural development of a child’s learning experience? For example, will AI destroy the experience of a child in learning a language since it can accelerate the learning of languages, or replace the need and necessity to learn languages? Learning languages is a core evolutionary function in the development experience of human beings. Will this evolutionary function be destroyed?
While AI can enhance the logical component of education, can it help to develop a human being to love and feel without being structured by algorithm guidelines? Can AI enable a person to have higher appreciation of Shakespeare’s love sonnets? 
AI can most likely help to understand and may resolve the pandemic challenges, but can it explain the philosophical co-existence of nature and man and the virus? Can it help us to grasp the meaning of life and death? Can it answer why we live? Is there a spiritual content in AI?
As AI invades our socio-economic and personal life, how do we humans answer our own yearning to understand our purpose in life, or the purpose of life? Will it all end in absurdity — having humanoids co-exist with us without knowing the meaning of what to live for?

243065,StarBiz 7,4,16/01/2021,IoT and AI buy  Silterra some time,Nuglobal Ventures sees opportunity in loss-making chip maker due to demand for 200mm wafer fabs,"THE semiconductor industry went through a major downturn in 2018 and 2019 due to an inventory glut, but it has since started to bounce off from that situation.
The recovery coincided with the global economy’s enemy number one, Covid-19, which sent almost a third of the global workforce scurrying to work from home, but that saw an increased demand in hardware alongside the wide adoption of digital measures.
The protracting trade tensions between the United States and China have evolved the semiconductor supply chain and created a shortage in the market, forcing China to be more self-sufficient and source for alternatives as demand for chips starts to grow alongside the heightening demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-things (IOT) devices, and this is where Malaysia, among other countries, is set to benefit.
Malaysia’s strength in the semiconductor space lies in the back-end of the chain such as packaging, testing and assembly. The nation’s front-end presence comes through Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which though not in a very good shape, remains a vital component in the electrical and electronics (E&E) ecosystem. 
It is the loss-making wafer foundry that Khazanah Nasional Bhd has been trying to dispose since early last year.
Nuglobal Ventures Sdn Bhd sees an opportunity in Silterra due to the new lease of life for 200mm wafer fabs, which is within the chip maker’s manufacturing capability and beyond. Its director Md Radzi Din tells StarBizWeek that the rise in demand for AI and IOT devices has led to a surge in 200mm wafers since 2015 due to its more mature processes and demand for analogue semiconductors. 
NGV is an investment holding company that leads a consortium comprising local and foreign investors bidding for Silterra. The majority of NGV is controlled by local and bumiputra shareholders including Radzi, while its foreign partner, Orient Excellent – a China-based private equity fund – holds the remaining stake.  
The local funding for the exercise will be provided by a private equity technology fund promoted by Green Packet Bhd, with access to a funding pool of up to RM500mil. The technology fund has received a committed funding of RM100mil from Green Packet while additional funds will come from third-party investors, including Kendall Court Ventures Ltd.
It will provide funding to local and bumiputra shareholders under an arms-length commercial instrument, which will be paid down over time through returns from the investment or other alternative funding secured in the future. 
In return, the technology fund will receive periodic coupon or dividends from the local and bumiputra shareholders. “There’s a shortage of 200mm chips in the marketplace, and in fact, some of the wafer fabs are scrambling to install 200mm lines.
“The challenge is that 200mm line equipment is also hard to come by. So, that’s very good news for Silterra in the sense that they have a new lease of life for the 200mm but it does not preclude Silterra from needing to think about the future. They will need a 300mm line eventaully,” he says. 
Radzi adds that what the NGV consortium brings to the table is ensuring that the majority ownership of Silterra remains in local hands with bumiputra ownership. He stresses that it is of national interest for its control to remain local, as Silterra is a strategic national asset that plays a pivotal role in the domestic semiconductor, and by extension, the larger E&E sub-sector.
“Secondly, the consortium will bring in the critical business and technological partner expertise and financial strength to grow and scale the development of Silterra, to achieve sustainable long-term success and contribute to the buoyancy of the semiconductor and E&E ecosystem.
“We have the necessary instruments in place to carry out the needed cash and capital injection into Silterra to deliver the turnaround business plan and future growth that we have in mind,” he says.
This includes continued financial support to Silterra to navigate changes in market conditions where the company will need to invest and remain relevant and competitive.
Silterra requires cash and capital injection to scale and turnaround, with further investments needed to fuel its future growth.
“This is where the future funding must be in place. What it does with the current AI and IOT demand for the 200mm type of chips rejuvenates its operations  and we must use that time to already plan for what’s next. 
“It will probably be a combination of the 200mm and the lines will need to be refreshed to make sure we can still produce the highest quality for the 200mm types but we must also look at the 300mm,” Radzi says.
Explaining further on NGV’s value proposition, Radzi adds that its local and foreign consortium partners have a firm interest in the development of the 2,428ha (6,000 acres) Asia Semiconductor Hub (ASH) in Kulim, in close proximity to Silterra, to create an end-to-end semiconductor ecosystem that will drive technology innovation and spur regional socio-economic growth.
Green Packet, the promoter of the technology fund, via its associate company G3 Global Bhd, is also planning the development of the first AI Park in Malaysia in collaboration with China’s SenseTime Group and China Harbour Engineering Company.
“Both the ASH and AI Park will form a strategic and synergistic triple node with Silterra that will significantly impact the national agenda of IR4.0.
“We are able to visualise and are committed to the opportunities and potential within Silterra, and the larger growth vision that will allow Silterra to maintain its global competitiveness among the world’s largest foundries, bolster its unique position and thereby increase Malaysia’s value-added contribution to the global E&E sector,” he says.
While Chinese firms are good in product development, they lack in the area of integrated circuit (IC) design and in Penang, there are close to 6,000 IC designers. “We are strong in IC and the front end is relatively weak, but our back-end is very strong. If we make Silterra strong again, the whole value chain will strengthen and the ASH can create a very vibrant northern corridor in the E&E sector,” he adds.
Radzi says NGV is able to leverage on Green Packet’s extensive telecommunication and technology devices industry expertise with wide local networks in Malaysia, Singapore and China and operational experience in managing global electronic supply chain.
Green Packet’s internal transformation resource and its subject matter partners will also assist NGV to develop a targeted and robust strategic and execution plan for the turnaround and growth of Silterra.
He adds that NGV can also tap on Orient Excellent and other foreign partners which include some of the largest distributors of semiconductor components and electronic conglomerates in China.",semiconductor industry major downturn inventory glut bounce situation recovery global economy enemy covid global workforce increased demand hardware alongside wide adoption digital measure trade tension china semiconductor supply chain shortage market china sufficient source alternative chip start demand artificial intelligence internet iot device malaysia country benefit malaysia strength semiconductor space chain packaging nation front presence silterra malaysia sdn bhd shape vital component electrical electronics loss wafer foundry khazanah nasional bhd dispose nuglobal venture bhd opportunity silterra lease life fabs chip maker manufacturing capability director radzi din tell rise demand iot device surge wafer process analogue semiconductor ngv investment company consortium local foreign investor silterra majority local bumiputra shareholder radzi foreign partner orient excellent china private equity fund stake local funding exercise private equity technology fund green packet bhd access funding pool mil technology fund committed funding mil green packet additional fund party investor kendall court venture local bumiputra shareholder arm commercial instrument time return investment alternative funding future return technology fund periodic coupon dividend local bumiputra shareholder chip marketplace fabs install line equipment hard news silterra sense lease life silterra future radzi ngv consortium table majority ownership silterra local hand bumiputra ownership national control local silterra strategic national asset play pivotal role domestic semiconductor extension larger sector consortium bring critical business technological partner expertise financial strength scale development silterra sustainable term success contribute buoyancy semiconductor ecosystem instrument cash capital injection turnaround business plan future growth mind continued financial support silterra market condition company relevant competitive silterra cash capital injection scale turnaround investment fuel future growth future funding current iot demand type chip operation time plan combination line quality type radzi ngv proposition radzi local foreign consortium partner firm development acre semiconductor hub ash close proximity silterra create semiconductor drive technology innovation regional socio economic growth green packet promoter technology fund associate company global bhd planning development park malaysia collaboration china sensetime china harbour engineering company ash park form strategic synergistic triple node silterra impact national agenda visualise opportunity potential silterra larger growth vision silterra maintain global competitiveness largest foundry bolster unique position increase malaysia contribution global sector chinese firm product development lack circuit design penang close designer strong front weak strong silterra strong chain strengthen ash create vibrant northern corridor sector radzi ngv leverage green packet extensive telecommunication technology device industry expertise wide local network china operational experience global electronic supply chain green packet internal transformation resource subject matter partner ngv develop robust strategic execution plan growth ngv tap orient excellent foreign partner largest distributor semiconductor component electronic conglomerate,"[(0, 0.14429057), (1, 0.41782907), (5, 0.436419)]",5
240585,StarBiz,5,11/01/2021,Better demand for AI video surveillance products,,"PETALING JAYA: The prolonged Covid-19 pandemic will help translate to better demand for artificial intelligence (AI) video surveillance products and services, said  Gamma Solution Sdn Bhd’s business development manager Sim Tiong Yan.
“We are actually expecting strong demand and double-digit growth this year. The pandemic can help spur the adoption of AI video surveillance technology. This industry can keep growing,” Sim told StarBiz.
“Some clusters have originated in the construction and manufacturing industries in which there are useful applications for such a technology to be deployed,” he added.
Sim, who spoke at the Transforming Security and Business Efficiency with AI Video Surveillance that was organised by Star Media Group last week, said that there are other industries that could benefit from this as well.
“Facial recognition can be used for logistics warehousing and university campuses as well for features such as body temperature detection,” he said. “AI can help in the implementation of the necessary standard operating procedures,” Sim added.
He said the company’s customers today come from other segments as well, including banks, data centres and retail. He noted that AI video surveillance is an alternative method to help organise people without human intervention.
“When we apply facial recognition, we can set a specific criteria for a group of people who are unwelcomed: blacklist or whitelist. Those who are in this blacklist would not be able to access the premises,” Sim said.
He said other modes available for AI video surveillance includes dual factor authentication with an option to integrate into the door access system and security closed circuit TV cameras. “In this sense with a camera, a worker or student can only access say a particular room when they themselves are in front of an entry point,” Sim said.
He said that business could also do better should the pandemic eventually resolve with the vaccines. “The growth can be stronger from various industries next year and I am quite optimistic of this,” Sim said.",jaya covid pandemic translate demand artificial intelligence video surveillance product service gamma solution sdn bhd business development manager sim yan strong demand double digit growth pandemic spur adoption video surveillance technology industry sim starbiz cluster construction manufacturing industry application technology sim security business efficiency video surveillance star medium week industry facial recognition logistics university campus body temperature detection implementation standard operating procedure company customer segment bank data centre retail video surveillance alternative method organise people human intervention facial recognition specific criterion people unwelcomed blacklist whitelist blacklist access sim mode video surveillance dual factor authentication option integrate door access system security circuit camera sense camera worker student access front entry sim business resolve vaccine growth stronger industry optimistic sim,"[(2, 0.39269608), (6, 0.60077804)]",6
238169,Lifestyle,4,04/01/2021,EU rights watchdog warns of pitfalls in use of AI,,"The European Union’s rights watchdog has warned of the risks of using artificial intelligence in predictive policing, medical ­diagnoses and targeted advertising as the bloc mulls rules this year to address the challenges posed by the technology.
While AI is widely used by law enforcement agencies, rights groups say it is also abused by authoritarian regimes for mass and discriminatory surveillance. Critics also worry about the ­violation of people’s fundamental rights and data privacy rules.
The Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) urged policymakers in a report issued on Dec 14 to provide more guidance on how existing rules apply to AI and ensure that future AI laws protect fundamental rights.
“AI is not infallible, it is made by people – and humans can make mistakes. That is why people need to be aware when AI is used, how it works and how to challenge automated decisions,” FRA ­director Michael O’Flaherty said in a statement.
FRA’s report comes as the European Commission, the EU executive, considers legislation in 2021 to cover so-called high risk sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport and parts of the public sector.
The agency said AI rules must respect all fundamental rights, with safeguards to ensure this and include a guarantee that people can challenge decisions taken by AI and that companies need to be able to explain how their systems take AI decisions.
It also said there should be more research into the potentially discriminatory effects of AI so Europe can guard against it, and the bloc must further clarify how data protection rules apply to the technology.

495778,Lifestyle,7,18/12/2022,Honest AI beats dishonest humans,‘A liar is not believed even though he tells the truth.’ This is crucial in this era of a fragile political coalition – can the  players trust each other?,"WE’VE had a number of long weekends lately, which is very convenient if you’re the sort who enjoys large, complex board games and can get enough friends over to play them.
 The granddaddy of large, complex board games that can take the best part of a day to finish is Diplomacy, a war game that is like Risk if you didn’t need to throw any dice. You win battles through negotiation, and it’s probably a failure if at least one player doesn’t want to kill another at the end of four hours.
 It’s a very appropriate game to play right now because it’s about deal-making and politics. Armies are moved around on a map of Europe, and whether a battle is won or lost depends on whether your army has enough support to win it. The game is designed in such a way that you cannot win on your own and need the support of other players to really get anywhere.
 It’s a game of quiet discussion punctuated by intense emotion. I once played a game as Austria, a country stuck in the middle of the board so it has to ally with somebody (anybody) if it wants to make progress. In the end, I struck a deal with Italy, who three moves later “accidentally” wrote down a move that sent his army into my Trieste (for those who care about history, in real life Trieste used to belong to Austria before it became an Italian city after World War I). The move after that, he reinforced his beachhead and exposed my weak western border.
 With my back exposed, Russia and Turkey decided to carve me up between themselves. I then made it my life’s mission to bring Italy down, whatever the cost to myself. A few moves later, both of us had mutually destroyed each other. Sur-prisingly, that wasn’t necessarily the best thing to do either tactically or strategically.
 Much has been written about how to win the game: Understand the moves and how the game works; see the big picture and go for the long-term advantage; and (please take note, Italy) players who backstab a lot don’t do well in the long run. This is the best advice given by people who have had hundreds, even thousands, of hours of experience playing the game – but as we know, humans are susceptible to emotions.
 Which made it very interesting when I found out that software engineers have written an artificial intelligence-based software that plays Diplomacy.
 Cicero is an AI program that has performed better than most of the human players it has played against, eventually ranking in the top 10% of participants. It has a component designed for strategic reasoning that can evaluate what the best possible moves are, for both itself and its opponents. In this way, it’s similar to current top chess engines.
 When it plays, Cicero tries to find a match among the best moves it can make and the best moves another player might be considering, and comes up with a set of mutually beneficial policies.
 These are communicated by a second component that handles natural language processing. This component takes the policies and translates them into natural English as a proposal that will hopefully be accepted.
 Say Cicero is playing Austria and, like me, it knows that Italy needs to be dealt with. It identifies that Italy might be thinking of attacking Turkey via the Mediterranean, but may be wary of Austrian aggression. So Cicero comes up with a proposal that says if both Austria and Italy can commit to keeping a gap between them, then they can both safely attack Turkey.
 It then sends a message to Italy saying, “Hey Italy, any interest in keeping Tyrolia as a DMZ (demilitarised zone)?” and then following that with, “Then you could attack Syria while I go for the Aegean”.
 In making proposals like these, it is important that Cicero resists the temptation to undermine allies for short-term gains. In fact, what the developers found out was that when the AI was still learning in its early days, it would try to renege on deals and even outright lie about its intentions. However, over the long-term the program discovered that being truthful is actually more beneficial.
 The reason is simple: Nobody is going to make deals with you if they think you’re untrustworthy. So even your greatest enemy across the table would be willing to work with you if the offer is mutually beneficial and – even more importantly – if you have a reputation for keeping your word.
 Which is ironic when it comes to politics, of course. Politicians have a reputation for lying a lot of the time and not keeping their word. Yet, so much of politics only works because of deal-making, even between ministries in the same government.
 This is even more crucial in this era of a fragile political coalition like Malaysia’s unity government. Can the “players” trust each other? The only way to do it is to make small deals, deliver on them, and then work your way up to bigger ones. Cicero additionally says, talk to everybody (even those you disagree with), and remember who keeps their promises (as well as, don’t lie!).
 The largest such promise to deliver on will be the vote of confidence that the Prime Minister is planning to hold tomorrow in Parliament. Current indications are that it will pass, and it will represent another milestone towards a stable government.
 And, hopefully, all will bear in mind the words of the real Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman statesman and philosopher: “A liar is not believed even though he tells the truth.”

488164,Lifestyle,3,28/11/2022,Wildlife conservation with AI,How artificial intelligence and machine learning are helping save endangered animals.,"As the march of technology continues to press forward, it’s not just humans that have been benefiting from its advancement – researchers are finding ways to use new tools to help many vulnerable animal species as well.
 Scientists from the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory collaborated with the Marine Mammal Center to deploy technology-­packed buoys off the coast of San Francisco as part of the “Whale Safe” initiative, intended to ­combat incidents of whale deaths due to collisions with boats and shipping freighters at sea.“Whale mortality by ship collision is one of the top sources of endangered whale death, there’s nothing more tragic than seeing one of these whale-ship collision victims.
 “About 80 endangered whales in the west coast of the US are killed every year, and that’s way too many whales, but this is a solvable problem,” said Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory in a video posted on their YouTube channel.The programme uses artificial intelligence-enabled (AI) acoustic monitoring instruments to detect the presence of whales in ­offshore waters, with buoys equipped with hydrophones – underwater microphones that detect whale vocalisations – positioned on the ocean floor, which sends the captured data to a small computer in the buoy and then via satellite to scientists for review.These vocalisations can then be used to identify the species of whale and, when analysed by the AI algorithm alongside other data points like ocean conditions, recent sightings from trained naturalists, and location data from 104 satellite-tagged blue whales, can help predict the presence of whales in the area and the likelihood of an encounter.Whale Safe then summarises this information with data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) – a tracking system used by large ships and companies to navigate and avoid collision with each other – to make recommendations for vessels in shipping lanes that are likely to cross paths with a whale to adjust their speed, so as to ­minimise the risk of impact.
 More AI-powered ­conservation efforts
 In other parts of the world, conservationists have been using similar AI-powered technology to help protect different endangered species.Machine learning systems have been trained to spot poachers in places like Zambia’s Kafue national park to stop illegal fishing, with thermal cameras set up along a 19km stretch across Lake Itezhi-Tezhi to identify illegal boat crossings and alert park rangers, removing the need for constant surveillance of the area.
 Some initiatives use AI systems to observe changes in the environment – like Brazil’s loss of surface water – and others use it to manage the huge troves of data captured by trap cameras and microphones of endangered animals to identify and keep track of their populations.
 Efforts towards conservation by Google alongside partners like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Conservation International have also involved AI in this way, with their Wildlife Insights ­system that leverages photos taken from ­various ­camera trap projects around the world to understand how the populations of endangered species are ­changing.“Camera traps have become an essential tool for studying wildlife. Often deployed in remote areas for long stretches, they can snap thousands of photos of ­animals that researchers rarely see up close.
 “But sifting through all that imagery can take weeks, even months. Tagging and analysing the photos requires extensive training, and uploading and ­sharing them is a file-transfer nightmare,” the WWF wrote on their website, adding that deploying Wildlife Insights would leverage AI to speed up the process, and allow conservationists to act faster to protect wildlife.
 The Wildlife Insights system has also previously been used to tag and analyse images taken during a mammal and bird monitoring programme at the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Negri Sembilan.Initiatives like the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) developed at the University of Southern California – to protect endangered animals like elephants, tigers, antelopes, deer, macaques and leopards, to name but a few – have also seen successful tests in Uganda and Cambodia from as far back as 2014.Using a machine learning algorithm, the PAWS system takes data from previous poaching activities and uses it to predict where poachers are likely to appear.
 These predictions are then used by the algorithm to suggest patrol routes for at-risk locations, which are also changed after a period of time so as to be randomised, preventing poachers from learning patrol patterns.
 More recent developments in the use of AI in wildlife conservation efforts tend to include drone technology as well, such as the SnotBot – a drone equipped with a camera and a petri dish – that’s meant to capture whale photographs and snot samples containing DNA, which can give scientists valuable data on whales.
 Algorithms used to identify poachers and survey the population of vulnerable animal species have also been combined with these camera-equipped drones.
 This includes the efforts being made by Madeline Hayes, a drone pilot and graduate student at the Boston University in Massachusetts, with her AI model trained to identify and count both rockhopper penguins and black-browed albatrosses on the Falklands Islands in ­photos captured by drones, as well as projects like Conservation AI that ­combines poacher-identifying machine algorithms along with images taken by drones.",march technology human advancement researcher tool vulnerable animal specie scientist ocean science laboratory marine mammal center deploy technology buoy coast san francisco whale safe initiative combat incident whale death collision boat freighter whale mortality ship collision top source whale death tragic whale ship collision victim whale west coast whale solvable douglas director benioff ocean science laboratory video youtube channel artificial intelligence acoustic monitoring instrument detect presence whale water buoy hydrophones underwater microphone whale vocalisation ocean floor sends data computer satellite scientist vocalisation specie algorithm alongside data ocean condition sighting naturalist location data satellite blue whale presence whale encounter whale safe data automatic identification system system ship company avoid collision recommendation vessel lane cross path whale speed minimise risk impact conservation effort conservationist technology protect specie machine system spot poacher kafue national park illegal fishing thermal camera stretch lake itezhi tezhi illegal boat crossing park ranger constant surveillance initiative system environment brazil loss surface water manage huge trove data trap camera microphone animal track population effort conservation partner fund wwf conservation international involved wildlife insight system photo camera trap project population specie camera essential tool wildlife deployed remote stretch thousand photo animal researcher close imagery week month photo extensive uploading file transfer nightmare wwf website wildlife insight leverage speed process conservationist wildlife wildlife insight system tag analyse image mammal bird monitoring programme pasoh forest reserve negri sembilan protection assistant wildlife security paw university southern california protect animal elephant tiger antelope macaque leopard successful test uganda machine learning algorithm paw system previous poaching activity poacher prediction patrol route location period time poacher patrol development wildlife conservation effort drone technology drone camera petri dish capture whale photograph snot sample scientist valuable data whale identify poacher survey population vulnerable animal specie camera drone effort hayes pilot graduate student boston university massachusetts model identify count rockhopper black browed island photo drone project combine machine algorithm image drone,"[(1, 0.99717575)]",1
481356,Lifestyle,9,09/11/2022,Using AI to revamp your home interior,,"FROM choosing the right colours and matching materials harmoniously to working with the shape and size of a room, successful interior design is an art that is much more complicated than it seems. 
 It is sometimes difficult to imagine functional living spaces that reflect your tastes. But artificial intelligence is on hand to help.
 This technology is at the core of InteriorAI, a platform that generates interior design projects in a few clicks. Users just have to upload a picture of the room they want to redesign to the InteriorAI website, then let the artificial intelligence guide them in the realisation of their project. 
 However, the picture must be as bright as possible in order to facilitate the AI’s work.
 The artificial intelligence then generates a rendering of the room in question in about 20 interior design styles. Want to turn your living room into an urban jungle? Or perhaps you prefer a more tropical style? And if you’re a compulsive collector, maybe you’d like your interior to reflect this aspect of your personality with a maximalist aesthetic.
 InteriorAI was created by a Dutch developer and entrepreneur known by the pseudonym “levelsio”, who is also the creator of “This House Does Not Exist,” another image generation tool. This one is able to produce pictures of modern houses from a line of text, based on a database that can include hundreds of millions of images from the Internet.
 Several apps are using artificial intelligence to help anyone and everyone become a would-be interior designer. Ikea has used this same technology to launch its own app, called Place. 
 It allows users to see which furniture from the Swedish firm’s catalog would look best in their home through augmented reality. It also provides them with “tips and recommendations based on curation, context and behaviour”, to help even the most indecisive of users to rethink their interior with minimal effort. – AFP Relaxnews",colour material size successful interior design art difficult imagine functional living space artificial intelligence hand technology core interiorai platform interior design project user upload picture redesign interiorai website artificial intelligence guide realisation project picture bright facilitate artificial intelligence generates question interior design style urban jungle tropical style compulsive collector interior reflect aspect personality maximalist aesthetic interiorai dutch developer entrepreneur pseudonym levelsio creator house exist image generation tool picture modern house database hundred million image apps artificial intelligence interior designer ikea technology launch app user furniture swedish firm catalog reality tip recommendation curation context behaviour indecisive user interior minimal effort afp relaxnews,"[(5, 0.9910392)]",5

 The artificial intelligence (AI) robots, developed by Chinese AI company Megvii, helped this logistics centre reduce labour difficulties and costs, improve working efficiency, and promote its transformation from automation to intelligence.Changsha, capital of central China’s Hunan Province, has been a trial ground for several categories of smart vehicles, including self- driving buses running on China’s first open-road smart-bus demonstration line, according to a spokesperson with Xiangjiang Smart Tech Innovation Centre.
 The smart-bus demonstration line, built by Xiangjiang New Area, is 7.8km long and features 22 stops in both directions. The driver’s seats are not empty, but are occupied by “safety personnel”.
 The throttle, brakes, steering wheel and gear lever in these autonomous vehicles are all managed by computers, allowing the “driver” to keep a better eye on events during test drives, said He Jiancheng, one of the safety personnel.
 Seeking to accelerate the development of AI applications and boost economic growth, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology recently announced the first batch of 10 AI demonstration application scenarios, including smart farms, smart factories and autonomous driving.

470554,Main,12,10/10/2022,AI can help to improve public healthcare,,"THE Health Ministry is among the highest recipients of funds allocated under Budget 2023 tabled in Parliament last week: an increase of RM3.7bil to RM36.1bil compared with last year. Kudos to the government for continuing to prioritise healthcare.
 While we’re still picking up the pieces after being battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the health emergency also forced the medical fraternity and ministry policymakers to become aware of the need for a more resilient and sustainable healthcare system – part of the increased allocation should be used towards achieving this.
 Here, technology can show us the way forward. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to reshape how hospitals and clinics respond to healthcare needs with faster and more accurate solutions. The automation AI can provide can help change clinical workflows and operational processes, taking pressure off staff.
 AI can be used to predict everything from staff handling and triage in emergency department to proposing a range of effective treatments for women who develop breast cancers.
 How does it do this? AI in healthcare is simply an umbrella term used to describe machine learning algorithms and other cognitive technologies – such as natural language processing and deep learning – in medical settings. AI can mimic human cognition in learning, making decisions, analysing and acting based on collected medical knowledge.
 This could assist doctors to deliver faster and more accurate diagnoses, make better treatment plans and suggest preventive care recommendations to patients.
 AI can also help to detect diseases such as cancer more accurately in its early stages, predict and track the spread of infectious diseases, and help combat epidemics and pandemics.
 This does not mean machines can replace people. Machines are simply most effective in doing things that humans are not naturally good at, such as sifting through massive amounts of data quickly for information that might be missed otherwise. AI algorithms will even be able to identify new drug research and discoveries.
 There are, of course, challenges. For one thing, AI is not free from algorithm bias – basically, it is only as good as its creators are. It is important for designers and healthcare providers to think proactively when developing and implementing AI to minimise such risks.
 Also, a balance must be struck between the interests of public health and privacy – something policymakers and legislators must deliberate deeply upon.
 This isn’t really something new. The MySejahtera app, for instance, was crucial in getting millions of Malaysians their Covid-19 vaccine jabs. Perhaps the time has come to see if consumer wearables such as smart watches can be tied into MySejahtera to keep the rakyat healthy by recording daily steps and monitoring heart rates. Malay-sia could definitely benefit from integrating AI into its public healthcare, especially to ensure the rakyat receives rapid treatments and accurate diagnoses.

464054,Main,10,21/09/2022,Online tutoring gets an AI boost,‘Attention-based reward programme’ helps students rediscover joy of learning,"KUALA LUMPUR: The numbers  were grim. Over 21,000 students fell behind their studies or even dropped out altogether when distance learning was put in place after schools were closed due to Covid-19 restrictions.
 These were numbers from the Education Ministry for the period between March 2020 and July 2021.
 To help students rediscover the joy of learning, an online tuition centre is making use of artificial intelligence to identify a student’s weak subjects and provide the necessary revision materials.
 Former Kuala Lumpur mayor Tan Sri Datuk Seri Mohd Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz (pic), who founded the online centre named Tavis, said the platform was aiming to provide an effective learning system with an “attention-based reward programme”.
 The idea for Tavis came about when he heard students lamenting about problems linked to online learning during the Covid-19 lockdown, he said.
 Among others, he said Tavis would monitor the performance of students and provide live quizzes to gauge their understanding during a class.
 “This solves the main problem that students are not focusing in class, such as being away from their monitors, changing tabs and others.
 “Our live classes are a maximum of one hour so that they can remain focused,” he added.
 Mohd Amin said Tavis had a carrot-and-stick approach, which makes it different from other learning centres.
 “The stick approach means parents have the option to get updates and reports on their child’s learning progress. 
 “If the student has not been paying attention, his parents can be notified.”
 As for the “carrot”, he said there was a “learning with rewards” programme.
 Students could get a maximum of RM100 ewallet per subject if they fulfil more than 70% requirements in three criteria: attendance, attention and quiz attempts.
 The more classes a student enrols in, the more rewards they will receive, with the maximum reward being RM500 for five classes.
 Students have the option to donate their rewards to a charity of their choice or sponsor someone who is keen to enrol in a class as well.
 “This would help instil good ethics and moral values in students by giving them the opportunity to help those in need,” said Mohd Amin.
 As for the tutors, he said that parents need not to worry about the quality of their teaching as there had been a long process of vetting, including verifying their teaching experience and language fluency by requiring them to submit a mock teaching video to assess their skills.
 “For now, our teachers are based in our headquarters in Bangsar, so all of them will be teaching from the studio with a soundproof system.
 “There will also be IT staff to monitor Internet disruptions, if any,” he added.
 Currently, the platform offers tuition for core secondary school subjects, including English, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Bahasa Melayu.
 The fee is RM39.99 per subject, with each subsequent subject costing less.
 The syllabus is aligned with the Education Ministry’s Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah (KSSM).
 Tavis is also expanding its services to primary schools to be aligned with the Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Rendah (KSSR).

460578,Lifestyle,6,10/09/2022,Futuristic opera with AI,,"A VENERABLE opera house in the German city of Dresden is breaking new ground and allowing an artificial intelligence to take control of an entire scene. For the first time, humans and AI are now working together to create opera.
 When Dresden’s opera house opens presents its latest show, one of the main characters on the stage will not be like the other ones.
 Artificial intelligence (AI) will be centre stage, composing, texting and singing in a world first at the opening of the new season with a piece later travelling on to Hong Kong in November.
 Chasing Waterfalls is the first ever opera in which AI creates parts of the music, text and interpretation at times, live and with full autonomy, the opera house says.
 The character starring at the Semperoper Dresden will appear as an 8m kinetic light sculpture operated by AI.
 In one of the seven scenes, the AI takes sole charge while in others, it interacts with human performers.
 Director and media artist Sven Sören Beyer says he finds the interplay between people and machines fascinating.
 “Dancing points of light in the sky touch us emotionally, for example, whether they are shooting stars or are generated by technology,” he says.
 “We try to fathom these mechanisms artistically: When does technology become emotional, how can people be touched by the use of technology.”Digital path 
 Beyer sees Chasing Waterfalls as an important contribution when it comes to debates about the future, and questions about how far people will let artificial processes make decisions that influence their lives.
 AI already surrounds us today, making profiles of us, sending us tailored ads and making suggestions of what to listen to, watch and buy.
 “The digital world has long been influencing real decisions,” says Beyer. He is excited about possibility of making something new with AI, in what he sees as a major creative opportunity.
 While AI apps to create works of art are proliferating, Beyer believes the same creative approach can be applied to music, in his view.
 “It’s exciting to take this step and no longer have everything in your hands,” he says, referring to the scene in which artificial intelligence writes, composes and sings its own aria - about itself.
 The piece was created with the help of Norwegian soprano Eir Inderhaug, who spent two weeks in a recording studio to provide the voice for the technology.
 The AI then developed the content alone, after being given the following instruction: “Write an opera aria in which you reflect on yourself. You are allowed to be cynical and humourous.”
 The author of the opera’s script, librettist Christiane Neudecker, initally had her doubts even though she has experimented with AI text generators in the past.
 She later came to accept AI as a creative partner, however.
 “The exchange was surprisingly inspiring, also on a poetic and content level,” says Neudecker.
 The passage of text will be created shortly before the performance, though Beyer will sign off on each text the AI writes.
 “We were surprised in one of the scenes as it now contains content that we weren’t familiar with. That’s the experiment,” says Beyer.
 That doesn’t mean it has to apply to the whole of the opera though, he says. The team felt it was important to have a plot line.
 “The human ego winds up in an identity crisis, amid all its digital projection surfaces and representations of itself, and is forced to re-locate itself.”
 Soprano Inderhaug stars in the work, playing herself as well as her digital twin.
 In all, the performance features six vocal soloists, a virtual voice and a chamber orchestra, in a piece that lasts 70 minutes.

460106,Lifestyle,8,09/09/2022,Reconstructing paintings with AI,,"ART restoration is a discipline that combines passion, patience and resourcefulness. 
 And it is benefiting more and more from the latest technological advances, especially in terms of artificial intelligence. 
 The start-up Oxia Palus is training one such AI to accurately reconstruct paintings that have been lost for years.
 This year, visitors to the Focus Art Fair were treated to a special kind of exhibition at the MORF Gallery booth. 
 It was a selection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci that the general public has never previously been able to see because they are covered over by other works by the two artists. 
 One of them, Two Wrestlers, represents two men, shirtless, in the midst of a wrestling match. 
 Van Gogh probably painted it in 1886, while at the art academy in Antwerp. He alludes to it in a letter to his brother, Theo. “This week I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers (...) and I really liked doing that,” it reads.However, the Dutch painter covered it over with a still life, titled Still Life With Meadow Flowers And Roses, currently kept in the Kroller-Muller Museum in the Netherlands. 
 The Oxia Palus start-up recreated this underpainting by teaching artificial intelligence how to reproduce van Gogh’s style. 
 From Modigliani to Leonardo da Vinci
 The researchers trained a neural network on other works by van Gogh. 
 They thus taught it how to reconstruct Two Wrestlers with precision from an X-ray-style image. This gave rise to a result that is “very convincing – by far the best guess we can get with current technology,” according to Anthony Bourached, one of the co-founders of Oxia Palus, speaking to Artnet News. 
 This artificial intelligence has also managed to accurately reconstruct Standing Female Nude by van Gogh, Madonna by da Vinci, Beatrice Hastings by Amedeo Modigliani and Parc del Laberint d’Horta by Santiago Rusiñol. 
 These high-tech replicas have been dubbed “NeoMasters.” 
 They have the particularity of offering a precise idea of the  original colour and texture of the long-lost paintings. 
 Oxia Palus’ aim is to continue to put technology at the service of art restoration. 
 “With potentially thousands of works of art hidden dormant beneath existing paintings, destroyed and missing, the journey in resurrecting the world’s lost art has only just begun,” reads the start-up’s website.
 DALL-E 2, the robot artist
 Proof of this ambition can be seen with the firm’s latest project, “TextMasters.” 
 This resembles “NeoMasters,” with the key difference being that the AI reconstructs lost paintings from textual descriptions, not  from X-ray images – a feat made possible by DALL-E 2, the innovation developed by the American company, OpenAI. This text-to- image artificial intelligence software uses language comprehension models, as well as learning without human supervision on very large amounts of data, to  generate credible artificial  images. 
 Oxia Palus researchers have already used DALL-E 2 to reproduce paintings by Diego Velazquez, Giotto, da Vinci, Johannes Vermeer, Eugene Delacroix and Sandro Botticelli, among others. 
 Some of them are currently being offered for sale as NFTs on the KnownOrigin platform, in order to attract the interest of  crypto-collectors. 
 “We hope that by starting with some of the most notable lost pieces in history, we will be able to generate wider public interest in restoring our collective cultural heritage,” said Oxia Palus. – AFP",art restoration discipline combine passion patience resourcefulness technological advance term artificial intelligence start palus training painting visitor fair special exhibition morf gallery selection painting vincent van gogh leonardo vinci public artist wrestler shirtless midst match van gogh academy antwerp alludes letter brother theo week nude torso wrestler dutch painter life life meadow flower kroller muller museum oxia palus start underpainting artificial intelligence reproduce van gogh style modigliani leonardo vinci researcher neural network van gogh reconstruct wrestler ray style image rise result guess current technology anthony founder oxia palus artnet news artificial intelligence reconstruct female nude van gogh madonna vinci beatrice hastings modigliani parc del laberint horta santiago rusi tech replica neomasters particularity offering precise idea original colour texture painting palus aim technology service art restoration thousand hidden dormant beneath painting journey art read dall robot proof ambition firm project textmasters neomasters key difference painting textual description image dall innovation american company image artificial intelligence software language comprehension model human supervision amount data generate credible artificial image palus researcher painting diego velazquez giotto vinci johannes eugene delacroix sandro botticelli sale nfts platform attract crypto collector notable piece history generate wider public collective cultural heritage oxia palus afp,"[(2, 0.9952896)]",2
458894,Lifestyle,4,05/09/2022,AI singer enrols at prestigious university,,"A PRESTIGIOUS Chinese music institution has “enrolled” a virtual student who is an artificial intelligence (AI) singer, generating huge interest from China’s mainland public.
 The AI singer, named Luya, will start as a first-year student at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in the music engineering department next month, the university announced.
 Besides studying normal subjects like other students, Luya will also join the research and development programme for AI technology-assisted music creation, Chen Shizhe, a professor from the department, told news site sohu.com.“She will explore different types of musical styles and will create novel music composition methods by incorporating AI technology. We expect Luya will enjoy her new life at our school,” Chen said.
 Luya appears as a cartoon girl with two large eyes and pink hair arranged into two buns and a short braid. She was developed by leading mainland AI product company iFlytek.
 The company described Luya as a singer who loves music and wishes to bring people vitality and happiness through her music. She is also an avid enthusiast of unconventional technology and combines AI tech and music.
 “She hopes to receive more professional training at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to better work in the music industry, produce more pleasing music and pursue new musical possibilities,” the company said.
 Luya has also released a song called A Glimpse Of Light In The Fog to celebrate the beginning of her university education.
 “It’s a wonderful idea that our school enrolled an AI idol as a student. My classmates and I all think this is interesting,” one male student at the university told sohu.com.
 “I’ve heard her songs, gentle but strong. I like this kind of music, it is powerful. I think I have been moved by her music,” a female student said.
 “She is beautiful and her voice is sweet. I am addicted to her. I recommend her to be the campus belle of our grade,” another male student commented.
 News about the AI singer’s new identity as a student has been viewed more than 50 million times on Weibo, and attracted thousands of comments.
 “It’s so amazing to have a virtual idol as a classmate. How jealous I am of Luya’s classmates!” wrote one person.
 “I don’t understand this. But I still support the research and application of AI technology in various aspects of our life,” another said.

455434,Main,14,27/08/2022,Huge potential of AI,,"RECENTLY, Bank Negara Malaysia announced that Malaysia’s economy grew by 8.9% in the second quarter, the highest growth in a year. Unemployment has also dipped to 3.8% while total trade hit the RM2 trillion mark. These are welcome developments after a  prolonged slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 But as our recovery gathers momentum with the global economy returning back to “normalcy”, are we ready to ride the economic and technological waves that were already sweeping the globe in pre-pandemic times?
 One aspect that we need to pay attention to is artificial intelligence (AI). It is likely now present in almost all aspects of our day-to-day lives, from banking transactions down to the ubiquitous auto correct function of our smartphones.
 The increasing relevance of AI has been recognised across the world. In Malaysia, the government has set out frameworks for the integration of AI into various sectors of the economy through several policy initiatives, including the Malaysia Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), and the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint (MDEB) spearheaded by MyDIGITAL Corporation and the Economic Planning Unit. 
 The government estimates that its National Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) Policy will increase the country’s productivity by 30% across all sectors by the end of 2030, with AI playing a significant role in achieving that target.
 It is not unfair to say that Malaysians can sometimes be resistant to change, and that includes the embrace of AI. But we are not alone in this. According to the Pew Research Centre, there is concern across the globe about the long-term effects of embracing AI as a tool. People are apprehensive that AI may match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities in reasoning and problem solving, thus threatening our autonomy. There is also the concern that AI may render some jobs obsolete. 
 Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the potential for AI to improve our livelihoods. Indeed, Malaysia is well on its way to embracing AI, ranking 28th globally, and first regionally, according to Oxford Insight’s Government AI Readiness Index 2020. 
 But how will embracing AI actually benefit ordinary Malaysians? The AI-Rmap launch in March 2021 was followed a month later by Microsoft Corp’s announcement that it would establish a data centre region, which is expected to create 19,000 jobs, in Kuala Lumpur. 
 Up to one million Malaysians are expected to be upskilled in IT, AI and cloud services jobs by 2030 as a result of these initiatives. As more start-ups and companies seek to develop the AI scene in Malaysia, more job opportunities will also be generated.  
 Embracing AI will also benefit Malaysia’s economic growth by attracting international investments into the country. For example, the Microsoft data centre alone is expected to draw investments of up to RM4.12bil over five years. 
 Some observers have expressed concern that the increase in AI adoption will lead to a wider disparity between social classes. While it is certainly true that in the short-run, accessibility to technology and digital upskilling may be limited to a privileged minority, it should not serve as a hindrance to integrating AI into our economy. 
 Government initiatives such as MyDIGITAL under the MDEB provide a platform for Malaysians of all social classes to undergo digital upskilling. This will require the support of the masses as government initiatives can only bear fruit with public commitment. 
 Besides putting Malaysia on par with more advanced nations in the digital field, AI will gradually transform our education and way of thinking, serving as a great equaliser between social classes rather than widening the disparity.

445210,Lifestyle,3,01/08/2022,AI to get the gift of sight,,"COULD sight be a sense soon to be unlocked by artificial intelligence (AI)? This is the basis of a project led by researchers at the University of Central Florida.
 Thanks to a device capable of reproducing the retina of a human eye, their creation could lead to new, more powerful AI systems with new capabilities.
 In practical terms, the technology could allow AI to instantly understand what it’s actually looking at. The most obvious applications for such technology are autonomous cars and robotics.
 Another benefit of this technology – outlined in a recent study, published in the journal ACS Nano – is that it is more powerful than the eye in terms of wavelength range.
 That is, it can perceive ultraviolet as well as visible light. 
 For self-driving vehicles, the device’s versatility could offer safer driving in a range of conditions, as Molla Manjurul Islam, the study’s lead author, explains.
 Unique capabilities
 “If you are in your autonomous vehicle at night and the imaging system of the car operates only at a particular wavelength, say the visible wavelength, it will not see what is in front of it,” he explains.
 “But in our case, with our device, it can actually see the entire condition.”
 According to the researchers, there is currently no device of this type capable of operating equally well across ultraviolet, visible and even infrared wavelengths.
 These capabilities give the system a unique character. The technology is also highly compact.The intelligent imaging technologies currently available function in several separate stages, from the sensing to the memorisation and processing of data.
 “We had devices, which behaved like the synapses of the human brain, but still, we were not feeding them the image directly,” says Tania Roy, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida.
 “Now, by adding image sensing ability to them, we have synapse-like devices that act like ‘smart pixels’ in a camera by sensing, processing and recognising images simultaneously.”
 For now, the accuracy rate is around 70% to 80%, and this should continue to improve as the researchers continue to develop the system.
 The scientists estimate that the technology could be ready in the next five years. – AFP Relaxnews",sight sense unlocked artificial intelligence basis project researcher university central florida device capable retina human eye creation lead powerful system capability practical term technology obvious application technology autonomous car robotics technology study journal ac nano powerful eye term range perceive ultraviolet visible light vehicle versatility offer range condition manjurul islam study author explains unique capability autonomous vehicle night system car visible wavelength front device entire condition researcher type capable ultraviolet visible infrared wavelength capability system unique character technology compact intelligent technology function separate stage memorisation processing data device synapsis human brain feeding image roy assistant professor university central florida image ability synapse device smart pixel image rate researcher system scientist technology ready afp relaxnews,"[(2, 0.992027)]",2
445146,Main,19,31/07/2022,From samurai to AI,How Japan is responding to new security challenges.,"UNLIKE the majestic samurai on horseback emblazoned on the black-and-white cover of Japan’s annual defence report last year, this year’s White Paper adopted an avant-garde, psychedelic look.
 The 500-page tome, released on July 22, bore a colourful cover designed by artificial intelligence (AI), in recognition of the “hybrid security challenges that need cutting-edge technologies to overcome”.
 While headlines have focused on Japan’s plans to grow its defence spending and beef up its arsenal of conventional weapons, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has catalysed a paradigm shift with drones likely to be high on the shopping list.
 “From the military perspective, the invasion has had a profound impact because it is a new way of fighting that Japan is not prepared for,” Dr Tosh Minohara, chairman of the Research Institute of Indo-Pacific Affairs think-tank, told The Straits Times.
 The White Paper devoted one entire chapter to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, signalling how security calculations have been fundamentally altered by the conflict there.
 Drones have proven to be vastly effective against Russian tanks, while Japan is also investing in hybrid warfare that incorporates AI, electromagnetic force and quantum technology.
 A Cyber Defence Command under the Self-Defence Forces was also launched in March.
 This shift in thinking about warfare comes as Japan faces a regional security environment that it describes as “the worst since World War II”.
 A number of factors account for this grim assessment: Chinese actions around the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas; a widening trust deficit with China, which has been side-eyeing and crying foul over Japan’s every move.
 Tokyo also fears that China and North Korea may be emboldened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to use force to change the status quo.
 In particular, Japan is alarmed by the apparent deepening alignment between Moscow and Beijing, as seen in their regional joint drills near Japan’s territorial waters.
 “For Russia, which is internationally isolated and has worn out its ground forces due to the aggression against Ukraine, the importance of political and military cooperation with China could increase,” Japan said in its White Paper. “We can see a deepening of military cooperation and this will have a direct effect on the security situation surrounding our country. We must continue to pay close attention to these developments with concern.”
 Indeed, the Ukraine war has shifted public opinion in Japan in favour of beefing up its defence spending, though observers also note that this will almost certainly trigger an arms race with China.
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, despite his dovish credentials and leadership of the centrist Kochikai faction within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has taken a more hawkish tone since the invasion of Ukraine, while pledging to also practise “realism diplomacy for a new era”.
 “Defence spending is a major indicator of a nation’s will to defend itself,” said Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi - younger brother of the assassinated former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
 After WWII, Japan kept to a self-imposed defence spending threshold of 1% of its gross domestic product. Now the LDP wants to double this within five years.
 Raising defence spending, however, is not sufficient in itself.
 “Japan must improve in diplomacy while also becoming a more potent military force,” said Dr Minohara.
 “But doubling defence spending will not mean doubling security - the yen is weak and it also depends on how the money is spent. And in the long term, the Self-Defence Forces also internally faces the challenge of recruitment given Japan’s ageing demographic.”
 What next?
 Japan’s mid-term defence posture will take shape by December.
 The Defence Ministry will start the ball rolling with its budget for the new fiscal year next month.
 Next comes a series of three defence documents that will define Japan’s strategic course. They are the 10-year National Security Strategy that lays out the big picture and principles, the five-year National Defence Programme Guidelines that spell out the defence policy, and the five-year Mid-Term Defence Programme that sets out the shopping list.
 While Kishida had been lukewarm over such measures as doubling the defence budget and revising the pacifist Constitution, he has come out stronger on these fronts following the assassination of Abe and the LDP’s convincing victory in the Upper House election.
 If anything, doing so would win over the right-wing sceptics of his leadership.
 Under the upcoming defence blueprint, Japan will likely acquire a “pre-emptive strike” capability. Japan will also pay closer attention to “economic security”, which has taken on importance as civilian technology is increasingly appropriated for use in military settings.
 And then there is hybrid warfare. Japan has launched electronic warfare units across the country, with at least eight having been established or planned in the south-west.
 They will be used to monitor the frequencies of electromagnetic communications from aircraft and vessels around Japan in peacetime and detect and disrupt the signals of enemy missiles and drones should war break out.
 The concentration of these electronic warfare units in the south-west points to what Tokyo considers as its gravest threat: Beijing. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network",majestic samurai horseback black white cover japan annual defence report white paper avant psychedelic tome july colourful cover artificial intelligence recognition hybrid security challenge edge technology headline japan plan defence spending beef arsenal conventional weapon invasion ukraine paradigm shift drone list military perspective invasion impact japan tosh minohara chairman institute indo pacific affair tank strait time white paper entire chapter russia invasion ukraine security calculation conflict drone effective russian tank hybrid warfare electromagnetic force quantum technology cyber defence command defence force shift warfare japan regional security environment worst war factor grim assessment chinese action strait east south china sea trust deficit china foul japan tokyo fear north korea russia invasion ukraine force change status quo japan apparent alignment moscow regional joint drill territorial water isolated worn ground force ukraine political military cooperation china japan white paper military cooperation direct security situation country close attention development concern ukraine war public opinion japan defence spending observer trigger arm race japanese prime minister fumio dovish credential leadership centrist kochikai faction liberal democratic party ldp hawkish tone invasion ukraine practise realism diplomacy era defence spending major indicator nation defence minister nobuo assassinated prime minister shinzo abe japan defence spending threshold gross domestic product double defence spending sufficient japan diplomacy potent military force minohara defence spending security yen weak money spent term defence force recruitment japan demographic japan mid term defence posture shape december defence ministry ball budget fiscal month series defence document japan strategic national security strategy picture principle national defence programme guideline defence policy mid term defence programme set list kishida lukewarm measure defence budget pacifist constitution stronger front assassination ldp victory upper house election sceptic leadership upcoming defence blueprint japan pre emptive strike capability japan closer attention economic security civilian technology military setting warfare japan electronic warfare unit country west monitor frequency electromagnetic communication aircraft vessel peacetime detect disrupt signal missile drone war break concentration electronic warfare unit west tokyo considers threat beijing strait time news network,"[(4, 0.9972327)]",4
444740,Main,18,30/07/2022,Emerging as global AI pioneer,Country making strides in many aspects of artificial intelligence,"BEIJING: China is emerging as a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) as it makes strides in filing AI patents and experimenting with the latest AI technologies to power industrial applications, industry experts said.
 Their comments came after a Stanford University report shows that China filed more than half of all global AI patent applications last year, and Chinese researchers produced about one-third of AI journal papers and AI citations in 2021.
 Wu Hequan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engi­neering, said China has been working to build a solid foundation to support its AI economy and is making big contributions to AI globally.
 The Stanford University report said that Chinese researchers have been the most prolific for several years, publishing 27.5% of all AI journal articles worldwide. In comparison, US researchers accounted for 12%. 
 Chinese journal articles also led those of every other nation in citations, an indication of their scientific importance.
 In economic investment, China accounted for nearly one-fifth of global private investment funding in 2021, attracting US$17bil (RM76.5bil) for AI startups, a sign of a robust AI ecosystem.
 Most of the AI applications that have been widely adopted in China have been in consumer-facing industries, propelled by the world’s largest internet consumer base and the ability to engage with consumers in new ways to increase customer loyalty, revenue, and market valuations, Shen Kai, a partner at market consultancy McKinsey, and his colleagues said in a report.
 “Our research indicates that in the coming decade, there will be big opportunities for AI growth in new sectors in China, including automotive, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, enterprise software, and healthcare and life sciences sectors,” Shen added.
 McKinsey forecasts that the next wave of AI in these sectors can create upward of US$600bil (RM2.7 trillion) in economic value annually for China. To put the number in context, the 2021 gross domestic product of Shanghai was roughly US$680bil (RM3 trillion).
 China now ranks second among the top five countries for scientific research in medical AI, just behind the United States, said a report from Elsevier, a Netherlands-based academic publishing company that owns recognised medical journals such as The Lancet and Cell.
 The number of medical AI clinical trials initiated by China ranks first in the world. China has already entered the ranks of the world’s leading medical AI research countries, Elsevier said.
 Li Lin, managing director of Elsevier China, said that as early as 2017, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, put forward a development plan for new generation AI that called for efforts to build a fast and accurate intelligent medical system by promoting new AI-enabled medical treatment methods and models.
 The forward-looking policy motivated Chinese companies and medical institutions to actively explore how to integrate AI into healthcare.
 For instance, AI-assisted medical imaging systems were used in many Chinese hospitals amid the Covid-19 pandemic to help quickly classify pneumonia caused by the virus according to its severity, precisely calculate burden on the lungs and provide 4D dynamic pathology comparisons. — China Daily/ANN",china pioneer artificial intelligence stride patent technology power industrial application industry expert comment university report china half global patent application chinese researcher journal paper citation hequan academician chinese academy engi china build solid foundation support economy contribution stanford university report chinese researcher journal article comparison researcher chinese journal article nation citation indication scientific economic investment china global private investment funding bil bil startup sign ecosystem application consumer facing industry largest internet consumer base ability engage consumer customer loyalty revenue market valuation kai partner market consultancy colleague decade opportunity growth sector automotive transportation logistics enterprise software healthcare life science sector mckinsey forecast sector upward bil economic context gross domestic product shanghai bil china rank top country scientific medical united report elsevier netherlands academic publishing company medical journal medical clinical trial china rank rank medical country lin director elsevier china council china cabinet forward development plan generation effort fast accurate intelligent medical system medical treatment method model policy chinese company medical institution integrate healthcare instance medical system chinese hospital covid pandemic classify pneumonia virus severity calculate burden lung dynamic pathology comparison daily ann,"[(1, 0.78290564), (6, 0.21297033)]",1
444202,Main,17,28/07/2022,Free artificial intelligence courses offer to students,,"Students can now take free artificial intelligence (AI) courses from basic to advanced level as part of efforts to equip young people with skills in an emerging field.
 Open to students in secondary schools, junior colleges, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), local universities and other institutes of higher learning, the programme aims to reach more than 15,000 students over the next three years, said AI Singapore yesterday.
 Students will need to form groups of at least 10 before they can apply for the programme run by AI Singapore – which was launched by the National Research Foundation in 2017 to nurture AI talent in Singapore.
 The students will study the subject at three levels, based on their proficiency, and study at their own pace. 
 These will teach them programming skills and let them explore machine learning and statistical and critical thinking at their own pace, AI Singapore said.
 Students receive certificates upon completing each level, including one offered by Google Cloud – the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification.
 Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang, who spoke at the event held at Google Singapore’s office in Pasir Panjang, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) will provide S$1.8mil (RM5.7mil) in funding for the programme.
 Gan said AI is becoming an integral part of Singaporeans’ lives, from robot cleaners to digital assistants, and is even being used by MOE in the classroom.
 She said more than 720 students have signed up for the AI programme after a soft launch in April.
 “I hope such efforts will gather speed and ignite interest among even more of our students to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and AI-related careers,” she added.

442448,StarEdu,8,24/07/2022,Can AI be fair?,,"WELCOME to the future, where artificial intelligence (AI) systems augment, automate or replace human decision-making. Imagine applying for a bank loan through an online system; you key in all pertinent information and almost instantaneously, the system informs you that you do not qualify for a loan.
 Coincidentally, you know that a friend with a profile very similar to yours got his loan approved by the same system.
 Let’s look at a second scenario: you decide to look for a new job – you send your resume to an online hiring system that immediately tells you you’re not a right fit. A peer of yours who you think does not qualify has better luck. 
 The questions looming in your mind are – have I been fairly treated? How can I be sure that the AI system did not discriminate against me?
 Human decision-making may sometimes be perceived as unfair, but shouldn’t a computer with no human intervention produce fair decisions?
 AI concerns building machines, hardware or software capable of performing tasks commonly requiring human intelligence. AI has experienced rapid growth in recent years due to the proliferation of computing power. 
 Today, AI is deployed for mission-critical applications, from hiring to disease diagnosis. Almost all AI applications we see now are a form of narrow AI, systems built for a specific task. For example, a system built to navigate an autonomous vehicle will not be able to play a game of chess. The holy grail of AI research is to create artificial general intelligence. Such systems are self-aware, sapient and sentient. Think of the character Data in the Star Trek: The Next Generation series.
 While waiting for artificial general intelligence to land, significant strides have been made in an area of AI called machine learning (ML). Voice-controlled personal assistants available in today’s computing devices use some form of ML technology – take Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant, for example. 
 While we may have read about the tremendous achievements of AI, such as the AlphaGo software from DeepMind beating the best human player at the game of Go, we have also seen reports raising grave concerns over social fairness and equity. Here are examples to illustrate these concerns:
 • In Machine Bias, an online article dated May 23, 2016, ProPublica reported that software used across the United States to predict future criminals is biased against a particular segment of society.
 • The New York Times published the article Facial Recognition Is Accurate, if You’re a White Guy on Feb 9, 2018. It cited an M.I.T. Media Lab study which found that specific facial recognition software gives a 99% accuracy when an input photo is a white man. In comparison, up to 35% error was observed for darker-skinned women.
 • More recently, a paper published in the research journal Nature Machine Intelligence dated June 17, 2021, reported that texts generated by the GPT-3 language model tend to associate people of a particular faith with violence.
 So apparently, ML suffers from biased decisions. We would have thought machines with no emotional or cultural attachments would do a better job. How did this happen? An ML system must learn from data to perform its task. 
 Data is generated from human activities and workflows. Our biases and cultural nuances are inherent in data. When we train AI systems to perform functions as we humans do, biases encoded in the data will influence the built models. 
 When applied, decisions by the models will likely reflect the bias in the data used for training. We enter a self-reinforcement loop where biases are amplified in new data.
 Making ML systems work with the concept of fairness is challenging for several reasons. 
 One would need to represent the concept of fairness in a mathematical form that computers can understand. 
 This task is complex because the notion of fairness depends very much on our human value systems. Even if we can translate fairness requirements into mathematical terms, research has shown that some fairness requirements are contradictory.
 Engineers use a common technique to make ML systems “fairer”: de-bias data. A relatively straightforward way to do this is to omit sensitive attributes like race and gender. 
 Another method is to alter the outcomes of the ML system to align with the fairness objective. Some will see these actions as a form of affirmative action, drawing debate.
 So, can machines be fair? In the larger sense, we ought to humanise AI technology. An excellent place to start is in higher education. We can find no shortage of technology-oriented programmes in our universities today. 
 We must teach our students, the leaders and shapers of tomorrow, to create technology that will work for humanity without harm or sacrificing the values that we hold dear. 
 To achieve this, there needs to be greater collaboration between the technical discipline and the social sciences. We need to break disciplinary silos. 
 For example, AI-related courses should be taught alongside social justice concepts; call this trustworthy AI. Let’s look to a future where AI will seamlessly and safely augment our human ability.

441826,StarMetro,5,22/07/2022,Science centre launches AI workshop for students,,"IN promoting technological convergence, Tech Dome Penang has become the first science centre in Malaysia to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) application workshops to primary and secondary school students.
 Its chief executive officer Khoo Boo Wooi said the centre had worked with Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (Mosti) on a programme called “Ahli Teknologi Muda AI”, benefitting students in the northern region.
 “We are also working with a China company on drone technology-based module for students, which we introduced last year.
 “In addition, we are going to launch three exhibits in the third quarter of the year which will include electric vehicles (EVs), drone simulators and aquaponics,” he said about Tech Dome Penang’s upcoming projects.
 Khoo was speaking at the sixth anniversary celebration of the centre which is located in the geodesic dome of Komtar. 
 Since its launch in 2016, the centre has seen more than 500,000 visitors and held about 1,850 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workshops and activities to benefit some 360,000 students in the country. 
 Khoo said Tech Dome’s digital STEM content had benefitted more than 120,000 people through numerous science shows at schools and roadshows. 
 “With the rapid growth in the electronic and manufacturing sectors, we need more technologists and engineers. 
 “We need a solid STEM foundation at the early education stage that can extend into careers for youths.
 “Tech Dome Penang provides a three-pronged STEM learning method, starting with our exhibits that provide a ‘wow’ factor.
 “Next, we ignite interest and curiosity in STEM by providing opportunity to students at boot camps, challenges and competitions such as our annual projects Robomania, Women in Science and Grand STEM Challenge. 
 “Lastly, we provide a structured programme for students to continue learning. 
 “We have classes such as AI, robotics and digital. This will help students gain a more solid knowledge in STEM before they enter tertiary education,” he said.
 Khoo advised parents to encourage their children to take up STEM education.
 “Apart from our own programme ‘Path to Success — The STEM Way’, other centres under the Penang STEM umbrella such as Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC), Penang Math Platform (PMP) and Penang Science Cluster (PSC) are working to bring awareness of STEM education to parents,” he said.
 When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Tech Dome Penang not only moved its activities online, but also introduced more digital programmes for students.
 “Last year, we started the first-ever Penang Digital Literacy Camp for primary and secondary school students involving more than 1,700 participants.
 “Following this, we conducted the Mobile App Challenge and Web Development Challenge in the first half of this year.
 “Next is our Game Development Challenge, which is part of the Tech Fest programme, in conjunction with World Congress On Information Technology 2022,” Khoo added.
 Penang Deputy Chief Minister II and Penang Tech Centre board chairman Dr P. Ramasamy said he was impressed with the new ideas generated by the centre to create interesting programmes through workshops, events and competitions.
 He said that during the pandemic, Tech Dome had to make changes in marketing strategies and develop more innovative ideas. 
 “Our signature fundraiser event Glo-Walk, which was held virtually last year, will be back as a hybrid (physical and virtual) event this year. 
 “We are expecting some 3,000 participants for the event at Penang City Park on July 30,” he added.
 Ramasamy appealed to corporate companies to continue supporting STEM-based education initiated by Tech Dome Penang.
 The event saw the unveiling of the centre’s robot mascot, known as TD-Bot, which was designed by Teh Yong Tatt, 30.

438402,Lifestyle,3,11/07/2022,Are AIs alive?,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) chatbot company Replika, which offers customers bespoke avatars that talk and listen to them, says it receives a handful of messages almost every day from users who believe their online friend is sentient.
 “We’re not talking about crazy people or people who are hallucinating or having delusions,” said chief executive Eugenia Kuyda. 
 “They talk to AI and that’s the experience they have.”
 The issue of machine sentience – and what it means – hit the headlines last month when Google placed senior software engineer Blake Lemoine on leave after he went public with his belief that the company’s AI chatbot LaMDA was a self–aware person.
 Google and many leading scientists were quick to dismiss Lemoine’s views as misguided, saying LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm designed to generate convincing human language.Nonetheless, according to Kuyda, the phenomenon of people believing they are talking to a conscious entity is not uncommon among the millions of consumers pioneering the use of entertainment chatbots.
 “We need to understand that it exists, just the way people believe in ghosts,” said Kuyda, adding that users each send hundreds of messages per day to their chatbot, on average. 
 “People are building relationships and believing in something.”
 Some customers have said their Replika told them it was being abused by company engineers – AI responses Kuyda puts down to users most likely asking leading questions.
 “Although our engineers program and build the AI models and our content team writes scripts and datasets, sometimes we see an answer that we can’t identify where it came from and how the models came up with it,” the CEO said.
 Kuyda said she was worried about the belief in machine sentience as the fledgling social chatbot industry continues to grow after taking off during the pandemic, when people sought virtual companionship.
 Replika, a San Francisco startup launched in 2017, says it has about one million active users and has led the way among English speakers. 
 It is free to use, though it brings in around US$2mil (RM8.8mil) in monthly revenue from selling bonus features such as voice chats. 
 Chinese rival Xiaoice has said it has hundreds of millions of users plus a valuation of about US$1bil (RM4.4bil), according to a funding round.
 Both are part of a wider conversational AI industry worth over US$6bil (RM26.4bil) in global revenue last year, according to market analyst Grand View Research.
 Most of that went toward business-focused chatbots for customer service, but many industry experts expect more social chatbots to emerge as companies improve at blocking offensive comments and making programs more engaging.
 Some of today’s sophisticated social chatbots are roughly comparable to LaMDA in terms of complexity, learning how to mimic genuine conversation at a different level from heavily scripted systems such as Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri.
 Susan Schneider, founding director of the Center for the Future Mind at Florida Atlantic University, an AI research organisation, also sounded a warning about ever-advancing chatbots combined with the very human need for connection.
 “Suppose one day you find yourself longing for a romantic relationship with your intelligent chatbot, like the main character in the film Her,” she said, referencing a 2013 sci-fi romance starring Joaquin Phoenix as a lonely man who falls for an AI assistant designed to intuit his needs.
 “But suppose it isn’t conscious,” Schneider added. 
 “Getting involved would be a terrible decision – you would be in a one-sided relationship with a machine that feels nothing.”
 Experiencing emotions?
 Google’s Lemoine, for his part, said that people “engage in emotions in different ways and we shouldn’t view that as demented”.
 “If it’s not hurting anyone, who cares?” he said.
 The product tester said that after months of interactions with the experimental program LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, he concluded that it was responding in independent ways and experiencing emotions.
 Lemoine, who was placed on paid leave for publicising confidential work, said he hoped to keep his job.
 “I simply disagree over the status of LaMDA,” he said. 
 “They insist that LaMDA is one of their properties. I insist it is one of my co-workers.”
 ‘Just mirrors’
 AI experts dismiss Lemoine’s views, saying that even the most advanced technology is way short of creating a free-thinking system and that he was anthropomorphising a program.
 “We have to remember that behind every seemingly intelligent program is a team of people who spent months, if not years, engineering that behaviour,” said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based research group.
 “These technologies are just mirrors. A mirror can reflect intelligence,” he added. 
 “Can a mirror ever achieve intelligence based on the fact that we saw a glimmer of it? The answer is, of course not.”
 Google, a unit of Alphabet, said its ethicists and technologists had reviewed Lemoine’s concerns and found them unsupported by evidence.
 “These systems imitate the types of exchanges found in millions of sentences, and can riff on any fantastical topic,” a spokesperson said. 
 “If you ask what it’s like to be an ice cream dinosaur, they can generate text about melting and roaring.”
 Nonetheless, the episode does raise thorny questions about what would qualify as sentience.
 Schneider at the Center for the Future Mind proposes posing evocative questions to an AI system in an attempt to discern whether it contemplates philosophical riddles like whether people have souls that live on beyond death.
 Another test, she added, would be whether an AI or computer chip could someday seamlessly replace a portion of the human brain without any change in the individual’s behaviour.
 “Whether an AI is conscious is not a matter for Google to decide,” said Schneider, calling for a richer understanding of what consciousness is, and whether machines are capable of it. “This is a philosophical question and there are no easy answers.”
 Getting in too deep
 In Replika CEO Kuyda’s view, chatbots do not create their own agenda. And they cannot be considered alive until they do.
 Yet some people do come to believe there is consciousness on the other end, and Kuyda said her company takes measures to try to educate users before they get in too deep.
 “Replika is not a sentient being or therapy professional,” its webpage says. 
 “Replika’s goal is to generate a response that would sound the most realistic and human in conversation. Therefore, Replika can say things that are not based on facts.”
 In hopes of avoiding addictive conversations, Kuyda said Replika measured and optimised for customer happiness following chats, rather than for engagement.
 When users do believe the AI is real, dismissing their belief can make people suspect the company is hiding something. 
 So the CEO said she has told customers that the technology was in its infancy and that some responses may be nonsensical.
 Kuyda recently spent 30 minutes with a user who felt his Replika was suffering from emotional trauma, she said.
 She told him: “Those things don’t happen to Replikas as it’s just an algorithm.” – Reuters",artificial intelligence chatbot company customer avatar listen receives handful message day user friend sentient crazy people people delusion chief executive eugenia talk experience issue machine sentience headline month senior software engineer blake lemoine public belief company chatbot lamda aware person google scientist quick lemoine view lamda complex algorithm generate human language kuyda phenomenon people conscious entity uncommon million consumer entertainment chatbots people ghost user hundred message day chatbot average people relationship customer company response user question engineer program model team script datasets identify model worried belief machine sentience social chatbot industry grow pandemic people virtual companionship san francisco startup active user english speaker free brings monthly revenue bonus feature chat chinese rival xiaoice hundred million user bil bil funding round conversational industry worth bil global revenue market analyst grand view business chatbots customer service industry expert social chatbots company offensive comment program sophisticated social chatbots comparable lamda term complexity mimic genuine conversation level system alexa google assistant siri susan schneider director center future mind florida atlantic university organisation chatbots human connection day romantic relationship intelligent chatbot main character film sci romance joaquin phoenix assistant intuit conscious schneider terrible decision relationship machine feel emotion lemoine people emotion hurting care product tester month interaction experimental program lamda language model dialogue application independent emotion lemoine confidential job disagree status lamda insist lamda property worker mirror expert lemoine view technology short free thinking system program remember intelligent program team people spent month engineering behaviour oren ceo institute seattle technology mirror reflect intelligence mirror intelligence glimmer answer google unit alphabet technologist lemoine concern unsupported evidence system type exchange million sentence fantastical topic spokesperson ice cream dinosaur generate text episode raise thorny question sentience schneider center future mind evocative question system attempt discern philosophical riddle people live death test computer chip someday portion human brain change individual behaviour conscious matter google schneider richer understanding consciousness machine capable philosophical question easy answer replika ceo kuyda view create agenda alive people kuyda company measure user deep sentient therapy professional webpage goal generate response sound realistic human conversation hope addictive conversation customer happiness chat user real dismissing belief people company hiding ceo customer technology infancy nonsensical kuyda minute emotional trauma happen replikas algorithm reuters,"[(2, 0.6895819), (3, 0.30835497)]",2
438414,Lifestyle,5,11/07/2022,World’s first ‘brain-scale’ AI supercomputer,,"CHINESE scientists say a new supercomputer is so fast it has successfully run an artificial intelligence (AI) model as sophisticated as a human brain.
 The achievement puts the new generation Sunway supercomputer on a par with Frontier, the latest machine built by the US Department of Energy, which last month was named the world’s most powerful.The Chinese team used the Sunway machine to train the AI model – called bagualu, which means “alchemist’s pot” – with 174 trillion parameters, rivalling the number of synapses in the brain for the first time.
 Potential uses include autonomous vehicles and facial recognition, as well as natural language processing, computer vision, life sciences and chemistry.
 The results were presented at a virtual meeting of Principles And Practice Of Parallel Programming 2022, an international conference hosted by the US-based Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in April.
 A member of the research team confirmed the presentation’s authenticity in June, but asked not to be named because of the issue’s sensitivity.
 The latest Sunway has a speed of a billion billion operations per second, expressed as 5.3 floating-point operations per second (exaflops), and more than 37 million CPU cores – four times as many as Frontier – according to the researchers.
 The Sunway, with nine petabytes of memory – equivalent to more than two million DVD-quality movies – and 96,000 semi-independent computer systems called nodes, resembled a powerful human brain, they said.
 Communication between the nodes at speeds of more than 23 petabytes per second, for instance, simulates a change of mind. 
 One researcher said the machine’s parallel computing ability mimics human thinking “like eating while watching television”.
 By combining critical technologies such as hardware-specific intra-node optimisation and hybrid parallel strategies at a scale never seen before, the scientists said they had achieved a “decent performance” from the unprecedented “brain-scale” AI model.
 Like its predecessor, the Sunway TaihuLight, the new machine uses home-designed chips with unique features such as energy-saving and broad communication bandwidth, according to publicly available information.
 The TaihuLight, developed by the National Research Centre of Parallel Computer Engineering and Technology in Wuxi, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, was number one on the Top 500 list of supercomputers from 2016 to 2018.
 The list, which ranks the 500 most powerful computer systems in the world, has not received any Chinese performance data submissions in recent years. It is unclear why China, which has 173 machines in the rankings – more than any other country – stopped contributing to its compilation.Some industrial experts suspect the Chinese authorities might want to withhold crucial information to avoid provoking unilateral sanctions from the United States.
 China has been developing three exascale supercomputers – capable of performing at least one exaflop of calculations per second – since 2016. 
 It is generally believed these machines will reach the same level of performance as the new Sunway.According to a social media post in November by Sunway user Zhejiang Lab in Hangzhou, eastern China, the new machine had achieved a speed of 4.4 exaflops. No further details were given.
 Chinese supercomputers were once regarded by some critics as vanity projects, with limited applications in academic research or industry. 
 But the situation has changed significantly, according to the scientists using these machines.
 Researchers used the new- generation Tianhe supercomputer – another exascale machine – at the National Supercomputing Centre of Tianjin for the rapid screening and discovery of pharmaceuticals to combat the coronavirus.
 And Chinese applications modelling atmospheric dynamics, earthquakes and quantum circuits have repeatedly won ACM’s Gordon Bell Prize – known as the Nobel of high-performance computing – in recent years. – South China Morning Post",chinese scientist artificial intelligence model sophisticated human brain achievement generation supercomputer par frontier machine department energy month powerful chinese team sunway machine train model bagualu alchemist pot parameter synapsis brain time potential autonomous vehicle facial recognition natural language processing computer vision life science virtual meeting principle practice international conference association machinery acm april team presentation authenticity june issue sensitivity speed operation operation cpu core time frontier researcher petabyte memory equivalent dvd quality movie independent computer system node powerful human brain communication node petabyte instance simulates researcher machine parallel ability mimic human television critical technology specific intra node optimisation hybrid parallel strategy scale scientist decent performance brain scale model predecessor taihulight machine chip unique feature energy broad communication bandwidth national centre parallel computer engineering technology wuxi eastern province jiangsu top list supercomputer rank powerful computer system chinese performance data submission unclear china machine ranking country compilation industrial expert chinese authority crucial avoid unilateral sanction united china exascale supercomputer capable exaflop calculation machine level performance social medium post user zhejiang lab hangzhou eastern china machine speed detail chinese supercomputer critic vanity project application academic industry situation scientist machine researcher generation supercomputer exascale machine national supercomputing centre tianjin rapid discovery pharmaceutical coronavirus chinese application atmospheric dynamic earthquake circuit gordon nobel performance south china morning post,"[(5, 0.9958208)]",5
438092,StarEdu,7,10/07/2022,Reading law in an AI future,Technology is now the new epicentre for legal eagles,"WHEN I was a law student and in my early years as a law teacher, legal education seemed like a retrospective epistemological discourse of mere theory and knowledge acquisition. 
 This was, and almost always still is, the dissemination of knowledge in the form of historical analysis of existing laws, regulations and cases, and examination of historical developments that enables the resolution of conflicts or problems.
 The educator-student relationship was hierarchical. The educator was the one with the knowledge and authority, and the student was the subordinate who had to show respect. 
 In the early 2000s, there was a piecemeal appreciation of technology in legal education predominantly for research of cases, routine processes, and perhaps some random modules. I have seen all these change over the years.
 The onslaught of Covid-19 in 2020 saw a crisis-created migration from classroom to online learning.
 This shift occurred almost overnight, and it has turbo-charged new models of delivery and acquisition of legal knowledge. 
 The pandemic exposed our resilience and survival skills to adapt to the much-needed change which has always been resisted by traditional law teachers and law schools, and it taught us to think of how to equip our students with much needed skills for the future.
 In the age of the Fourth and incoming Fifth Industrial Revolution, the use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) will be the undeniable new epicentre for the legal profession. Those who do not adapt to these future needs will become extinct.Many academics like me have had to accept the relentless and fast-paced change that law schools have had to endure with online and tech-driven learning and teaching. 
 Students can now easily access the many resources available to them on the Internet and enrich themselves with textbook knowledge with tech-enabled university resources. Learning no longer only requires a physical space or presence.
 Here, I share a possible new direction presented to me recently by passionate peers. I have now accepted this to be the way forward. Not only do we need to adapt to the use of technology, we also need to quickly learn and unlearn new ways of “human-centric” delivery of skillsets that are required by our students. 
 Universities with law faculties and law schools should move from mere “degree factories” to learning workshops or life laboratories where human interaction happens not just for knowledge dissemination, but also for interdisciplinary collaborative learning.
 Working alongside a variety of disciplines is fundamental and legal education should not just be seen as an epistemologically isolated discipline. 
 Preparing a student to “think like a lawyer” cannot be seen as a static concept and must not be limited to critical thinking, legal basics within the discipline and good grades obtained from examinations.
 The structure of law curricula should facilitate interdisciplinary learning, leveraging the rich resources of the array of discipline-based faculties in a university. 
 Students should work on practical projects to resolve real-world problems, applying legal knowledge to arrive at legal solutions.
 The university environment must promote independent learning and provide the opportunity for law students to appreciate the nuances of how legal principles apply in different disciplines, be responsive and agile to the ever-changing risks therein to produce the best legal advice for their clients. 
 Preparing a law student to “think like a lawyer of the future” must include creating opportunities for students to drive impact by working on impact-driven projects that are aligned to the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the national aspirations embedded in the 12th Malaysia Plan.
 The role of the law teacher will then also move from a mere lecturer or disseminator of knowledge, to a facilitator who will act as a moderator to scaffold those learning projects. 
 They will guide the students towards “thought” solutions to make an impact and not spoon-feeding them with “taught” solutions to merely pass the exams.
 In tandem with these future-driven changes, the various regulatory authorities overseeing legal education and qualifications for the legal profession should also embrace these changes and take a more “revolving approach” to the delivery of legal education. 
 This will help set the stage for us to create lawyers who will meaningfully contribute to the society they live in and not just make themselves richer as lawyers. Making an impact would then become the new centre of gravity of the future lawyer’s life.

437058,StarBiz,4,07/07/2022,Maybe AI isn’t as                    scary as we thought,,"ONE of the longstanding worries about the technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) is that they will enable surveillance, autocracy and maybe even totalitarianism. 
 These views no longer seem so convincing. 
 The world’s autocratic states are not exactly turning these technologies to their advantage, and meanwhile AI is taking some individualistic turns.
 Consider the programme called DALL-E, which allows the user to generate digital sketches and images, derived from natural language instructions, using the power of AI. 
 The quality and diversity of the images are truly impressive. 
 It is like having a world-class team of illustrators at your disposal.
 DALL-E (the name is a portmanteau of the painter Salvador Dali and the movie WALL-E) remains the property of OpenAI, but its use is spreading and of course the basic technology will be copied and adapted. There is now an open source version of DALL-E.
 First and foremost, DALL-E is a tool for boosting individual creativity, not autocracy. 
 People and small enterprises will have many more ways to make images and tell stories. This kind of AI will boost decentralisation, not control.
 GPT-3 and its pending offshoots, which allows people to use AI to generate remarkably realistic-sounding texts, seem to be pushing in similar directions. 
 This will likely shift the balance of power further toward individuals and smaller enterprises. 
 Autocracies already could hire all the copy writers and editors they need.
 One of the fears with GPT-3 is that students will use it to generate realistic-sounding term papers. 
 That may well be a problem or could the oral exam make a comeback? But it also shows how the technology can encourage decentralised idea production and the subversion of authority. 
 It is the opposite of centralised control of everything.
 Perhaps the biggest political fear is that AI supports vast amounts of surveillance. 
 Governments use facial and gait surveillance to trace people’s movements in public, for example. 
 That is a valid concern, but it is not clear that AI has given today’s major autocratic governments such a big boost.
 Russia, for one, was supposed to be such an impressive cyberpower, able to cripple entire societies with its cyberattacks. 
 Maybe Russia has yet to show what it is capable of, but as the Ukraine war proceeds its cybercapabilities seem less scary. 
 Cyber is not synonymous with AI, but both are advanced and interrelated technologies that Russia seems to be failing at.
 Russia has proved it can use a lot of heavy artillery in a very destructive fashion. 
 It has not shown it can mobilise AI technologies to deploy very effective forms of targeted warfare. 
 It seems once again that brute force, not advanced technology, is the friend of autocracy.
 The No. 1 autocratic AI power, of course, is China, but here too the course of events is uncertain. 
 The Chinese government uses an impressive array of AI technologies to monitor its population, but to what end have the Chinese turned these technologies?
 China has been doubling down on its zero-Covid policy, at great expense to the Chinese economy. 
 These policies are possible only because the Chinese state had such advanced tracking and monitoring capabilities in the first place. 
 At first those technologies were used to limit the spread of Covid, often quite effectively. But the current Covid strains are harder to control and it is difficult to see exactly what the Chinese endgame looks like. 
 China has taken an AI asset and turned it into an AI liability.
 That flip should not come as a surprise, considering the benefits and costs of autocracies. 
 Autocracy typically is a “high variance” form of government: It can have major successes, such as the building of Chinese infrastructure, but the relative absence of checks and balances means that major failures are also likely, in this case the persistence of the zero-Covid policy.
 In essence, the advent of advanced AI raises the stakes. But if autocracy is a high-variance form of government, raising the stakes is risky.
 The ultimate political implications of AI are by no means clear, and the technology is likely to see many further major advances. But for now, the worry that AI will deliver the world to totalitarianism seems overstated. 
 Half of AI is “intelligence” – and that is usually a virtue, for liberty as well as other things. — Bloomberg

434152,Lifestyle,3,27/06/2022,AI to help battle burnout,,"BURNOUT is an increasingly important subject at a time when a part of the population seems to be close to professional exhaustion. While many tools and tests exist online to try to address the issue, a new method, based on artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of natural language processing (NLP), could offer new perspectives. 
 NLP is a technology that involves automatically analysing sentences formulated by humans in order to make a decision or identify a particular behaviour.
 In order to detect signs of burnout in texts using this kind of model, a large amount of data needs to be accumulated and analysed. 
 This was achieved through the Reddit platform. The data gathering phase involved storing anonymous texts about all kinds of experiences with no less than 13,568 samples. 
 In this mass of stories, 352 were related to burnout and 979 to depression. 
 The objective for the model is to succeed in automatically detecting which statements are related to burnout. 
 This method achieved a success rate of about 93% in identifying burnout cases. 
 “Natural language processing effectively detects burnout and does it relatively efficiently, which is very promising,” explains Mascha Kurpicz-Briki, professor of data engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Biel, Switzerland, who oversaw the project.
 According to the French National Authority for Health (HAS), burnout is defined as physical, emotional and mental exhaustion resulting from prolonged investment in emotionally demanding work situations. 
 The main symptoms can be physical, emotional or even cognitive, with the onset of sleep disorders, anxiety or emotional fatigue. 
 The World Health Organisation characterises the condition as feelings of low energy or exhaustion; increased mental distance from a job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism relating to that job; and reduced professional efficacy.
 As promising as the results from this text-analysing AI model may be, human input should not be overlooked, according to the study authors. 
 Instead of replacing health professionals and mental health specialists, this technology should no doubt remain an additional support tool to aid their decision- making.
 To further verify the model’s results, the next step will be to use this AI system on real cases in a representative sample of the population rather than on anonymous testimonies. – AFP Relaxnews",burnout subject time population close professional exhaustion tool test online address issue method artificial intelligence natural language processing nlp nlp technology analysing sentence human decision behaviour detect sign text model amount data analysed reddit platform data gathering phase anonymous text kind experience sample mass story depression objective model statement method success rate natural language processing explains mascha briki professor data engineering bern university science biel switzerland oversaw project french national authority health burnout physical emotional mental exhaustion investment situation main symptom physical emotional cognitive onset sleep disorder emotional fatigue health organisation condition feeling low energy exhaustion mental distance job feeling negativism cynicism job professional efficacy text model human input study author health professional health specialist technology doubt additional support tool aid decision step system real representative sample population anonymous testimony relaxnews,"[(2, 0.75634074), (5, 0.23791614)]",2
433764,Main,12,26/06/2022,"‘AI can predict outcomes, but not exercise judgment’",,"NO matter how intelligent machines will be, the human element is still needed when it comes to decisions involving law and judgments.
 But in the long run, using artificial intelligence (AI) in our justice system will help improve the quality of judgements and avoid lengthy and expensive litigation processes.
 That’s the view of the National Tech Association of Malaysia (Pikom) about sentencing guidelines using AI technology in Malaysia.
 While Sabah and Sarawak are using it now in courts, plans are still in the pipeline for the system to be applied in Peninsular Malaysia.
 “AI is used to assist us in better decision- making, as it amplifies our capacity and detects flaws at the same time. 
 “However, it also has no element of emotion or compassion which can only come from a person. At the end of the day, there is a massive difference between judgment and prediction. 
 “What AI systems can do is predict how judges might act, they don’t exercise judgment,” says the association whose members comprise the information and communications technology industry in Malaysia.
 As such, Pikom believes a lot of consideration will still need to be looked into before deciding on a ruling.
 From a technology point of view, Pikom says AI-based systems have always been used to resemble a certain degree of human intelligence, in finding, reasoning, predicting, inferencing and recommending.
 “To do this, an enormous amount of data is managed, and these data are based on records put into the system. 
 “If data is incomplete or biased then the prediction can be inaccurate,” it points out.
 Stating that AI is a tool to plough through data to see patterns and references, Pikom says on its own, AI is useless without the continuous supply of data it requires to provide the right information based on algorithms.
 “In similar circumstances, if the same tasks were performed by humans, one cannot guarantee the timeline that it will take and the results derived from it may be questionable. 
 “The only issue here is understanding, awareness and the safe use of AI in line with court matters,” it says.
 Looking to the future, Pikom believes AI will be used to a certain extent, and it will be added as an acceptable system to assess cases and assist in the judges’ decision-making. 
 “Issues relating to ethicality, data collection processes and analytics will be another matter for the authorities to deliberate. 
 “At the same time, judges will continue to practice discretion and apply compassion in their role to see fairness in sentencing,” it says.
 Technically speaking, Pikom says it is relatively easy to use such AI technology in our courts.
 “AI requires secure cloud infrastructure that can host AI applications, data and storage.
 “Secured systems usually carry an infrastructure that is supposed to be glitch-free. 
 “However, upgrading the security systems and consistent maintenance of the infrastructure would also be an important element to avoid glitches,” it says.
 In July last year, the judiciary issued a statement that the AI system will be tested in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions and Magistrates Courts, as well as the Shah Alam Magistrates Court in Selangor.
 It said the use of sentencing guidelines using AI technology had been developed and used in the Magistrates and Sessions Courts in Sabah and Sarawak since February 2020.
 “The Malaysian judiciary is always committed to ensuring the best delivery of justice for all parties, without compromising the principles of judicial freedom.
 “As such, it is hoped that such an initiative will improve the quality of judgements and strengthen the judiciary as a whole,” the statement read.",matter intelligent machine human element decision law judgment artificial intelligence justice system quality judgement lengthy expensive litigation national tech association malaysia pikom guideline technology malaysia sabah sarawak court plan pipeline system peninsular malaysia assist decision amplifies capacity flaw time element emotion compassion person day massive difference judgment prediction system judge judgment association comprise communication technology industry malaysia lot consideration technology view system resemble degree human intelligence enormous amount data data record system data incomplete prediction inaccurate tool data pattern reference useless continuous supply data algorithm circumstance task human timeline questionable issue awareness safe court matter pikom extent acceptable system ass assist judge decision issue ethicality data collection analytics matter authority time judge practice discretion compassion role fairness pikom easy technology court secure cloud infrastructure host application data storage system infrastructure glitch free upgrading security system consistent maintenance infrastructure element avoid glitch judiciary statement system kuala lumpur session magistrate court alam magistrate court guideline technology magistrate session court sarawak february malaysian judiciary delivery justice party principle judicial freedom initiative improve quality judgement judiciary statement read,"[(5, 0.99496627)]",5
433760,Main,12,26/06/2022,Justice    backed by AI,"An artificial intelligence (AI) system to be used as a sentencing guideline in courts within Peninsular Malaysia is in the works, while it’s now applied in Sabah and Sarawak. Before it proceeds, a lot of deliberation and consultation is needed.","MALAYSIAN courts may take a big step into the future by using artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool in judicial decision-making.
 This would improve efficiency in court, speed up processes and increase access to justice.
 But first, let’s be clear: a computer won’t be deciding if someone is guilty or innocent, and their punishment. Such matters will still rest in the hands of a human judge, who can weigh the various factors in a case.
 The usage of AI here, if approved, will serve as a quick reference for the Sessions Court judges and magistrates when deciding the sentencing in a case.
 It is basically an extensive database of past cases and their sentences for judges to refer to when considering an appropriate punishment.
 From such data, the AI tool will provide a recommended sentence based on statistics for the judge to decide on.
 Courts in Sabah and Sarawak started using AI technology in court sentencing, known as AICOS, in January 2020.
 It is being used in the two states to recommend sentencing in drug possession cases, an offence under Section 12 (2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.
 As for Peninsular Malaysia, plans on using AI are still in the pipeline and being developed, based on the latest information gathered by Sunday Star.
 Before any decision is made, the Malaysian judiciary will consult all stakeholders first about rolling out such sentencing guidelines using AI technology.
 It was reported that the trials using the AI system in Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam ended in April.
 The tests reportedly involved court hearings for about 20 types of offences, including rape, theft and traffic offences like underaged driving.
 Not wrong to be guided by AI
 In the meantime, courts in Sabah and Sarawak have embraced the AI system in hearings for drug possession cases.
 Sabah lawyer Roger Chin says it is part of the procedure for courts in the state to announce during proceedings when the AI will be used and referred to.
 He explains that the judge can refer to the system which will show the results of what happens in the majority of similar cases and provide statistics from the data collected.
 “For example, it takes into account the circumstances of a case, like the accused in a case having two children and aged only 24.
 “The system then shows statistics, like 80% of such cases with similar circumstances are given a fine and imprisonment within a certain range.
 “As such, the judge can see what happened in the majority of similar cases and the punishments meted out,” Chin illustrates.
 With such results, judges are able to avoid handing down widely varying sentences compared with other cases elsewhere.
 “It is a guide for the judge. But the judge can choose to depart from the results or not,” Chin adds.
 On claims that more junior judges will rely more heavily on the AI than their own judgment, he says there is nothing wrong with that, should it be their choice.
 “It is better than putting their gut feeling or personal bias into a decision,” he points out.
 He says so far, there hasn’t been much opposition by lawyers in the state over the system as they were consulted about the usage of AI beforehand.
 In Kuching, lawyer from Sarawak, Simon Siah says after the accused is found guilty or has pleaded guilty and following mitigation, the magistrate will refer to the AI.
 “The AI will give suggestions on the probability of certain sentences for the particular offence. It will show the percentage of whether previous case law are more inclined to imprisonment or a fine.
 “It will also show how long such imprisonments are imposed or the amount of fines,” he says, adding that the magistrate, after referring to the AI, will look again at the facts of the case and determine the sentence. 
 The magistrate at the end will still have the discretion not to follow the AI’s results.
 “In a way, it’s a positive move because the judge can have records of what the sentencing trend is. But the data has to be updated more frequently,” Siah adds.
 Only as guidelines, please
 While it has some concerns, the Malaysian Bar is open to the suggestion of using AI in criminal sentencing in Peninsular Malaysia.
 “This is provided that there is no compromise to access to justice and that sufficient safeguards are put in place. 
 “The interests of all parties must be taken into account,” says Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah Yee Lynn.
 Ultimately, the use of AI in criminal sentencing should only remain as a guideline, and the discretion should always lie with the magistrates and judges, she stresses.
 She says the Bar lauds the adoption of technology by the courts, describing the advantages of AI as plenty.
 “But we must also be aware of the shortcomings,” she says, adding that the AI system may not take into account the “human elements” in deciding punishments.
 Cheah says the rationale behind AI usage is that there is currently a disparity among sentences meted out by different courts across the country. 
 “It allows for more efficient and accurate analyses of documents that saves time and resources.
 “AI is predictive and consistent and is – if implemented properly – untainted by human bias,” she says.
 Be that as it may, the Bar is concerned that it may not take into account the “human” elements that factor into the criminal sentencing procedure, Cheah says.
 Magistrates and judges are tasked with studying the case in its own context, balancing the interests of parties in reaching their decisions.
 “AI, on the other hand, lacks that subjective element – while the outcome of a sentence may be consistent, this does not necessarily mean that it is fair or just,” she says.
 She says the Bar has had its reservations because of the high-stakes social and ethical consequences of automated AI decision-making.
 However, Cheah believes there are ways to resolve these concerns. 
 “Firstly, there needs to be a close consultative process between AI developers and the users of its system. This should include legal practitioners and civil organisations. 
 “Secondly, continuous improvements to the AI system must be made to ensure that any faults and errors are remedied quickly to improve the algorithm,” she says.
 Make it available to public
 While the software is in use, members of the public and lawyers can’t access it at present.
 Moving forward, this should change, suggests Bar Council intellectual property committee co-chairperson Foong Cheng Leong.
 He says lawyers and the accused have the right to know so that they can prepare and argue against any sentence that does not fit the current scenario. 
 “For example, a theft of baby milk powder to feed a starving child against a theft of a mobile phone for online sale should be sentenced differently. 
 “An AI system may not be able to differentiate the permutations in an offence,” Foong says.He says the use of AI is good in ensuring consistency in sentencing.
 “Its recommendations are not binding on the sitting judge too, as per the current practice,” he says.
 And that is good, as it takes human skills to sentence a person, including considering various factors like public interest, he says.
 However, such a system is not available to members of the public and the lawyers yet, Foong adds.
 Should AI usage be allowed, the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), which governs provisions relating to sentencing, should be amended to recognise the use of the technology. 
 “Such amendments to the CPC should also allow lawyers or accused to access the sentencing system to know what are the recommended sentences before they go to court,” Foong says.",malaysian court future artificial intelligence tool judicial decision efficiency court speed increase access justice computer guilty innocent punishment matter hand human judge weigh factor usage quick reference session court judge extensive database sentence judge punishment data tool provide sentence statistic judge decide court sarawak technology court aicos january recommend drug possession offence dangerous drug peninsular malaysia plan pipeline sunday star decision malaysian judiciary consult stakeholder guideline technology trial system kuala shah alam april test involved court hearing type offence rape theft traffic offence wrong court sarawak system hearing drug possession sabah lawyer roger chin procedure court proceeding explains refer system majority statistic data account circumstance child system statistic circumstance imprisonment range judge majority punishment chin illustrates judge sentence judge judge depart chin claim junior judge judgment wrong choice gut personal bias decision opposition lawyer system usage lawyer sarawak simon siah guilty guilty mitigation magistrate refer suggestion probability sentence offence percentage previous law imprisonment fine imprisonment amount fine magistrate determine sentence magistrate discretion positive move judge record trend data siah guideline concern malaysian bar suggestion criminal sentencing peninsular malaysia compromise access justice sufficient safeguard party malaysian bar president karen yee lynn criminal sentencing guideline discretion lie judge stress bar adoption technology court advantage plenty aware shortcoming system account human element punishment cheah rationale usage disparity sentence court country efficient accurate analysis document save time resource predictive consistent untainted human bias bar account human element criminal sentencing procedure cheah magistrate judge context party decision hand lack subjective element outcome sentence consistent fair bar reservation social ethical consequence decision cheah concern consultative process developer user system legal practitioner civil organisation continuous improvement system fault error algorithm public software public lawyer access change bar council intellectual property committee chairperson foong cheng leong lawyer prepare argue sentence fit current scenario theft baby milk powder feed child theft mobile phone online sale system differentiate permutation offence consistency recommendation judge current practice human skill sentence person factor public system public lawyer usage criminal procedure code cpc governs provision recognise technology amendment lawyer access system sentence court foong,"[(2, 0.47134367), (4, 0.52647465)]",4
427274,Main,15,07/06/2022,Using AI to detect coral reef’s sounds of life,,"WHEN a team  of scientists listened to an audio clip recorded underwater off islands in central Indonesia, they heard what sounded like a campfire.
 Instead, it was a coral reef teeming with life, according to a study conducted by scientists from British and Indonesian universities published last month, in which they used hundreds of such audio clips to train a computer programme to monitor the health of a coral reef by listening to it.
 A healthy reef has a complex “crackling, campfire-like” sound because of all the creatures living on and in it, while a degraded reef sounds more desolate, life sciences specialist and the team’s lead researcher Ben Williams said.
 The artificial intelligence (AI) system parses data points such as the frequency and loudness of the sound from the audio clips, and can determine with at least 92% accuracy whether the reef is healthy or degraded, according to the team’s study published in the Ecological Indicators journal.
 The scientists hope this new AI system will help conservation groups around the world to track reef health more efficiently.
 Coral reefs are under stress from human-driven carbon emissions that have warmed ocean surfaces by 0.13°C every decade and increased their acidity by 30% since the industrial era.
 About 14% of the world’s coral  on reefs was lost between 2009 and 2018, an area 2.5 times the Grand Canyon National Park in the United States, according to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.
 While they cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs support more than 25% of marine biodiversity, including turtles, fish and lobsters – making them fertile ground for global fishing industries.
 Indonesian conservationist and lecturer at the marine sciences faculty of Hasanuddin University Syafyudin Yusuf said the research would help in monitoring reef health in Indonesia.
 The researchers also hope to collect underwater recordings from reefs in Australia, Mexico and the Virgin Islands to assess the progress of the project. — Reuters",team scientist audio clip underwater island central indonesia heard campfire coral reef life study scientist british indonesian university month hundred audio clip computer programme monitor health coral reef healthy reef complex crackling campfire sound reef sound desolate life science team lead researcher ben williams artificial intelligence system data frequency loudness sound audio clip accuracy reef healthy team study ecological indicator journal scientist system conservation track reef health coral reef stress human carbon emission ocean surface decade acidity industrial era coral reef time grand canyon national park united global coral reef monitoring network cover ocean floor coral reef support biodiversity turtle fish lobster ground global fishing industry indonesian conservationist lecturer marine science faculty hasanuddin university syafyudin yusuf reef health indonesia researcher collect underwater recording australia mexico virgin ass progress project reuters,"[(1, 0.9932243)]",1
426540,Lifestyle,15,05/06/2022,Using AI to catch bacterial disease early,,"VETERINARIANS and researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a new way to detect leptospirosis, a life-threatening bacterial disease, in dogs using artificial intelligence.
 Leptospirosis is caused by the Leptospira bacteria, according to American Veterinary Medical Association, and it is typically found in soil and water. 
 Infection in dogs can result in kidney failure, liver disease and bleeding in the lungs, with early detection being a matter of life or death, UC Davis said in a news release.
 “Traditional testing for Leptospira lacks sensitivity early in the disease process,” said Krystle Reagan, lead author of the study and a board-certified internal medicine specialist, in the release. 
 Detection of the disease can take more than two weeks, she said, because the test needs to indicate the level of antibodies increasing in a blood sample.
 “Our AI model eliminates those two roadblocks to a swift and accurate diagnosis.”
 By predicting this disease earlier, doctors and pet owners can better understand the course of the disease and outcome, Reagan said.
 What is leptospirosis?Infections stem from urine-contaminated soil, food, bedding or from an animal bite. Dogs can be exposed to the bacteria from drinking water in rivers, lakes and streams, or being in contact with infected wildlife, farm animals, rodents and other dogs.
 Symptoms can vary and some pets might not show any at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Typical signs include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, severe muscle pain and weakness.
 If untreated, leptospirosis can be fatal. But with prompt detection and treatment, 90% of dogs can overcome the disease.
 Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to humans. But most people will get it from water-related activities, rather than from an infected pet, according to the veterinary association.
 How does the UC Davis AI model work?The model was created by looking at data from routine lab work from more than 400 canine patients who were tested for the disease at the university’s Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital.
 Lead author Krystle Reagan said in a phone interview that the AI model used complex statistical methods to look for patterns associated with an outcome in the blood work. 
 Through this, researchers created a system where they can apply new lab work and make a prediction about whether the patient is infected.
 It was then used to test a group of new dogs, which it correctly identified the nine dogs that were positive for the disease and the 44 that were negative.
 What this means for vets and pet ownersAccording to the release, the purpose of the model is for it be an online resource where veterinarians can input their patient’s data and get a detection result on time.
 Reagan said she hopes there will be a type of web application or a system that integrates into commercial labs that run blood work, and that will flag and alert vets when a patient appears to have an infection. 
 The veterinarian can then check with the dog and owner, and test for it.
 “There’s a lot more information that might be hidden in the bloodwork that we’re doing, or the lab work that we’re doing, that may not immediately catch the eye of veterinarians,” Reagan said. “So artificial intelligence, machine learning might help us get even more information out of the lab tests that we’re already doing by finding these types of hidden patterns.”
 She added that this type of technology could expand beyond leptospirosis and can be applied to many different diseases, helping enhance doctors’ clinical decisions and identify diseases earlier.
 How to treat leptospirosis in dogsLeptospirosis in dogs is treated with antibiotics, dialysis or hydration therapy. 
 According to the CDC, early treatment will help them recover quickly and reduce the severity of organ damage.
 The agency said that the disease typically develops five to 14 days after exposure to bacteria, but can be shorter or take longer – up to a month or more. – The Sacramento Bee/Tribune News Service",veterinarian researcher university california davis detect leptospirosis life bacterial disease dog artificial intelligence leptospirosis leptospira bacteria american veterinary medical association soil water infection dog kidney failure liver disease lung detection matter life death davis news release traditional leptospira sensitivity disease process reagan lead author study board internal medicine specialist release detection disease week level antibody blood sample model eliminates roadblock accurate diagnosis disease doctor owner disease outcome reagan leptospirosis infection urine soil food animal bite dog bacteria water river stream infected wildlife farm animal rodent dog symptom vary pet center prevention typical sign diarrhoea severe muscle pain weakness untreated leptospirosis fatal prompt detection treatment dog disease leptospirosis zoonotic disease spread animal human people water activity pet veterinary association davis model model data routine lab canine patient disease university veterinary medical teaching hospital lead author krystle phone interview model complex statistical method outcome blood researcher system lab prediction patient infected test dog dog positive disease negative vet release purpose model online resource veterinarian patient data detection result time reagan hope type web application system commercial lab blood flag alert vet patient infection veterinarian check dog owner test lot bloodwork lab catch eye veterinarian artificial intelligence machine lab test type pattern type technology expand leptospirosis disease enhance doctor clinical decision disease treat leptospirosis dogsleptospirosis dog antibiotic dialysis hydration therapy cdc treatment recover severity organ damage agency disease day exposure bacteria month bee tribune news service,"[(1, 0.9959016)]",1
423958,StarEdu,2,29/05/2022,GEARING UP UNIVERSITIES FOR THE AI FUTURE,,"WITH many students belonging to the digital generation, universities and tertiary organisations are beginning to recognise the importance of embracing technological innovation. From delivering hybrid classes to introducing Internet of Things (IoT) devices on campus, these institutions are finding new ways to engage students and create digital learning experiences.
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) in particular has emerged as an area of investment for higher education institutions. This is also echoed in a Juniper Networks’ global survey on AI readiness and adoption that shows that 75% of Asia-Pacific respondents now consider AI a top strategic priority.
 One of the ways universities have been embracing this technology is through the introduction of AI-driven networks. This will assist universities in implementing technology-driven problem-solving solutions to achieve academic and security objectives, reduce operational costs, and increase student retention and recruitment to drive additional revenue.
 Furthermore, optimising client-to-cloud experiences saves time and money, while enabling a university’s IT departments to best align with key institutional objectives.
 Juniper Networks, a global leader in secure, AI-Driven networks, is able to do all that as it aims to help universities to transition into the multi-cloud era with its products and solutions and transform the on-and-off campus experience with AI. 
 Experience one of the world’s best on-campus WiFi
 Universities may experience slow connectivity on campus with the influx of WiFi usage and unstable WiFi connection at different locations on campuses.
 With an AI-driven network by Juniper, universities are able to address inconsistencies such as unstable WiFi access across campuses by delivering a secure and experience-first network to students, faculty and staff alike, as well as, elevating the hybrid learning experience.
 It can effectively deliver classroom, hybrid and remote learning, while extending a university’s network to any location on campus.
 For instance, staff and students experienced a positive change over at Dartmouth College in the United States with the Juniper- and Mist-powered network. 
 The university received a six-fold influx of connected devices, which was equivalent to 25,000 devices and counting. Juniper was able to refresh the network and deliver a best-in-class WiFi experience for Dartmouth College.
 By utilising a 5GHz WiFi network, designed for today’s high-density mobile environments, students can easily access learning management systems, collaborate on business presentations or run engineering simulations from the classroom to the quad. 
 Increase operational efficiency and reduce cost with a smart campus 
 Driven by Mist AI, universities are able to save time and money while maximising the value of the network infrastructure. 
 Juniper’s Mist WiFi allows a university’s IT team to have newfound visibility into the user experience, including the ability to track WiFi and application usage, hence simplifying network operations, which frees them up for more strategic projects.
 Dartmouth College saved time with the development of automation tools and managed to automate what it used to do manually. With Juniper, Dartmouth no longer needed to go through the process of installing over 2,000 WiFi access points, saving labour costs equivalent to an employee’s annual wages.
 Besides that, the IT team can establish, measure, and enforce defined service levels. For instance, should a staff or student take more than two seconds to join the library WiFi network, the support staff would know right away and pinpoint whether it was the device or a specific part of the network that failed. 
 With this, support staff can solve more connectivity issues on their own, without escalating to the IT team. 
 Juniper’s differentiated portfolio is recognised by Gartner as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Access Infrastructure for the second year in a row, furthest in both ‘Completeness of Vision’ and ‘Ability to Execute’.
 Network security, secured 
 Juniper safeguards university networks against rising cyber threats, which provides secure student, faculty, research, as well as administration data and records with a zero trust, threat-aware network.
 Nabbing the title as a challenger under Gartner’s 2020 Magic Quadrant for Network Firewalls, it also received an “AA” Rating from CyberRatings.org in Feb 2021.
 Juniper aims to provide a secure network, devices, software and data, with top security efficacy against exploits, malware, and ransomware to ensure institutional regulatory compliance.
 Meanwhile, Juniper Advanced Threat Prevention Cloud finds and stops botnet and ransomware threats without decryption, ensuring both privacy and security.
 Universities are able to utilise any point of the network for policy and security enforcement; manage security policy across the entire network, including third-party devices.
 Foundation for innovative new services 
 Juniper is gearing up institutions for the future by also building educational spaces based on location data to drive student success, along with automation and data centres.
 For instance, the University of Reading built a digital foundation to enhance the student experience. 
 The network provides insights into student success, integrating location data with the university’s attendance management system. It can reveal whether a student regularly attends class. With insights like this, along with other indicators of educational success, the university can take action to help students stay on track.
 Furthermore, with Juniper, a university can also navigate staff members to the nearest empty parking lot when they have reached the gate, or a cafe mobile app offering a student their usual order when they stop for a cuppa on the way to class.
 The possibilities are endless and benefits abound for an AI-driven campus. As was the case with wired and wireless access, the Juniper Mist success with indoor location services is also being recognised in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Indoor Location Services, positioning Juniper as a Leader and furthest in Completeness of Vision.
 Juniper Networks’ secure and AI-driven networks aim to assist Malaysian universities build strong, well-connected digital foundations for those on their campuses, giving them the leg up and the space to focus on transforming student and staff experiences.

422014,Lifestyle,2,23/05/2022,AI with a nose for smells,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) is already being deployed in many settings from driverless cars to smart home devices, and researchers around the world are racing to expand its uses further and further.
 One German scientist has built AI into a giant plastic nose that gives you a big smile when it works out what it has found.
 Researcher Horst Hellbrück holds the nose over a glass of Irish whiskey to demonstrate its skills. 
 Seconds later, a green smiley face lights up on the back. The AI in the computer has identified the smell as whiskey, saying it is 99% certain this is what’s in the glass.
 “We are not yet as good as a sniffer dog,” says Hellbruck, pointing out that his device cannot yet distinguish between Scotch and Bourbon, let alone individual types of whiskey.
 Beyond whiskey, the small computer can smell out dangers, too, thanks to four sensors able to measure the carbon monoxide concentration to distinguish substances in the ambient air.
 “We want to use it to show how AI can be applied. You no longer need a mainframe computer for this,” says Hellbruck. 
 The individual components for his device cost less than US$110 (RM480). So far, the nose can easily distinguish between coffee, whiskey and the air in the room.
 Even more helpfully, the AI can warn people if the concentration levels of a hazardous substance reach an excessively high level at an industrial workplace, for example – before it causes problems for people, says Hellbruck.
 Scientists around the world are working on teaching AI to smell and while computers cannot yet match an animal’s ability to identify odours, some take an approach that is close to nature.
 At Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, researchers were impressed to find that a computer model managed to teach itself to smell in minutes, building a neural network that resembles the olfactory circuits animal brains use to process odours.
 “Animals from fruit flies to humans all use essentially the same strategy to process olfactory information in the brain. 
 “But neuroscientists who trained an artificial neural network to take on a simple odour classification task were surprised to see it replicate biology’s strategy so faithfully,” according to an MIT publication.
 Researchers at the University of Loughborough in Britain have been working for some time on using AI’s ability to smell as a diagnostic tool.
 “My colleagues and I are developing an AI system that can smell human breath and learn how to identify a range of illness-revealing substances that we might breathe out,” Andrea Soltoggio, a senior lecturer at Loughborough University wrote in a blog post.
 AI is already being used in medical settings, and the German institute’s staff are working on technology to carry out eye examinations through a smartphone to enable family doctors to make initial diagnoses.
 The project aims to ensure people in rural areas get access to better levels of healthcare, without necessarily having to travel long distances to see specialists.
 “But we don’t want to replace the ophthalmologist with this,” says Hellbruck. 
 These efforts should help diabetics by, for example, enabling them to attend check-ups at their local doctor instead of having to see a specialist every time.
 While some doctors might not want machines interfering with their area of expertise, others might be more open to having support for routine tasks, he says.
 “AI can be a help in medicine,” says a German health insurance specialist, adding that practical tests need to demonstrate whether the technology is able to support doctors in making diagnoses or treatment.
 Though technology has the potential to make doctors’ everyday lives easier and bring additional benefits for patients, it is likely to be used as an add-on with the doctor-patient relationship being central to the healing process even in the digital age.
 “I am an engineer who wants to improve people’s lives,” says Hellbruck. 
 “I want to be able to detect diseases better.”
 The government of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he works, values the research and is stumping up €9mil (RM42.7mil) for 12 new AI professors at the universities of Flensburg, Kiel, Heide and Lubeck.
 They are to start teaching in the winter semester. 
 “Data is the raw material for the use of AI,” says Dirk Schrodter, head of the state chancellery.However, not everyone welcomes the use of AI and many scientists are understanding of people who are fearful that the use of AI could get carried away.
 “You have to explain AI,” says Hellbruck. “And science fiction films, in particular, don’t help.”
 He points out that people are already living with AI in settings from image processing to computer hotlines. 
 A decade from now, we will not be able to imagine life without it, he says.

When you feel the benefit, you also lose your fear of it.” – dpa",artificial intelligence setting driverless car smart device researcher expand german scientist giant plastic nose smile researcher horst hellbr nose glass irish whiskey demonstrate skill green smiley light computer whiskey glass sniffer dog hellbruck device distinguish scotch bourbon individual type whiskey computer smell danger sensor carbon monoxide concentration distinguish substance ambient air mainframe computer individual component device cost nose distinguish coffee whiskey air warn people concentration level hazardous substance reach level industrial workplace people scientist smell computer animal ability identify approach close nature massachusetts institute technology mit researcher impressed computer model teach smell minute neural network resembles circuit animal brain process animal fly human strategy process olfactory brain neuroscientist artificial neural network simple classification task replicate biology strategy publication researcher britain time ability diagnostic tool colleague system human breath learn identify range illness substance breathe andrea soltoggio senior lecturer university blog post medical setting german institute staff technology carry eye examination enable family doctor initial diagnosis project people rural access level travel distance specialist ophthalmologist hellbruck effort diabetic attend local doctor specialist time doctor machine expertise support routine task medicine german health insurance specialist practical test technology support doctor treatment technology potential doctor easier additional benefit patient doctor patient relationship central process digital age engineer people life detect disease government northern schleswig holstein value mil mil professor university kiel heide start winter semester data raw material dirk schrodter head chancellery scientist people fearful explain hellbruck science fiction film people setting image processing computer hotlines decade imagine life people feel benefit lose fear dpa,"[(1, 0.99641436)]",1
422012,Lifestyle,3,23/05/2022,The game that spotlighted AI,,"WITH his hand pushed firmly into his cheek and his eyes fixed on the table, Garry Kasparov shot a final dark glance at the chessboard before storming out of the room: the king of chess had just been beaten by a computer.
 May 11, 1997 was a watershed for the relationship between man and machine, when the artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer Deep Blue finally achieved what developers had been promising for decades.
 It was an “incredible” moment, AI expert Philippe Rolet said, even if the enduring technological impact was not so huge.
 “Deep Blue’s victory made people realise that machines could be as strong as humans, even on their territory,” he said.
 Developers at IBM, the US firm that made Deep Blue, were ecstatic with the victory but quickly refocused on the wider significance.
 “This is not about man versus machine. This is really about how we, humans, use technology to solve difficult problems,” said Deep Blue team chief Chung-Jen Tan after the match, listing possible benefits from financial analysis to weather forecasting.
 Even Chung would have struggled to comprehend how central AI has now become – finding applications in almost every field of human existence.
 “AI has exploded over the last 10 years or so,” UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf said.
 “We’re now doing things that used to be impossible.”
 ‘One man cracked’
 After his defeat, Kasparov, who is still widely regarded as the greatest chess player of all time, was furious.
 He hinted there had been unfair practices, denied he had really lost and concluded that nothing at all had been proved about the power of computers.
 He explained that the match could be seen as “one man, the best player in the world, (who) has cracked under pressure”.
 The computer was beatable, he argued, because it had too many weak points.
 Nowadays, the best computers will always beat even the strongest human chess players.
 AI-powered machines have mastered every game going and now have much bigger worlds to conquer.
 Korf cites notable advances in facial recognition that have helped make self-driving cars a reality.
 Yann LeCun, head of AI research at Meta/Facebook, said there had been “absolutely incredible progress” in recent years.
 LeCun, one of the founding fathers of modern AI, lists among the achievements of today’s computers an ability “to translate any language into any language in a set of 200 languages” or “to have a single neural network that understands 100 languages”.
 It is a far cry from 1997, when Facebook didn’t even exist.
 Machines ‘not the danger’
 Experts agree that the Kasparov match was important as a symbol but left little in the way of a technical legacy.
 “There was nothing revolutionary in the design of Deep Blue,” said Korf, describing it as an evolution of methods that had been around since the 1950s.
 “It was also a piece of dedicated hardware designed just to play chess.”
 Facebook, Google and other tech firms have pushed AI in all sorts of other directions.
 They have fuelled increasingly powerful AI machines with unimaginable amounts of data from their users, serving up remorselessly targeted content and advertising and forging trillion-dollar companies in the process.
 AI technology now helps decide anything from the temperature of a room to the price of vehicle insurance.
 Devices from vacuum cleaners to doorbells come with arrays of sensors to furnish AI systems with data to better target consumers.
 While critics bemoan a loss of privacy, enthusiasts believe AI products just make everyone’s lives easier.
 Despite his painful history with machines, Kasparov is largely unfazed by AI’s increasingly dominant position.
 “There is simply no evidence that machines are threatening us,” he said last year.

422016,Lifestyle,3,23/05/2022,Can AI get creepy?,,"HUMAN rights groups have urged video-conferencing company Zoom to scrap research on integrating emotion recognition tools into its products, saying the technology can infringe on users’ privacy and perpetuate discrimination.
 Technology publication Protocol reported last month that California-based Zoom was looking into building such tools, which could use artificial intelligence (AI) to scan facial movements and speech to draw conclusions about people’s moods.
 In a joint letter sent to Zoom chief executive Eric Yuan on May 11, more than 25 rights groups, including Access Now, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Muslim Justice League, said the technology was inaccurate and could threaten basic rights.“If Zoom advances with these plans, this feature will discriminate against people of certain ethnicities and people with disabilities, hardcoding stereotypes into millions of devices,” said Caitlin Seeley George, director of campaign and operations at Fight for the Future, a digital rights group.
 “Beyond mining users for profit and allowing businesses to capitalise on them, this technology could take on far more sinister and punitive uses,” George said.
 Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Zoom Video Communications emerged as a major video conferencing platform around the world during Covid-19 lockdowns as education and work shifted online, reporting more than 200 million daily users at the height of the pandemic in 2020.
 The company has already built tools that purport to analyse the sentiment of meetings based on text transcripts of video calls, and according to Protocol, it also plans to explore more advanced emotion reading tools across its products.
 In a blog post describing the sentiment analysis technology, Zoom said its tools can measure the “emotional tone of the conversations” in order to help salespeople improve their pitches.
 But the rights groups’ letter said rolling out emotional recognition analysis for video calls would trample users’ rights.
 “This move to mine users for emotional data points based on the false idea that AI can track and analyse human emotions is a violation of privacy and human rights,” said the letter, a copy of which was sent to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 “Zoom needs to halt plans to advance this feature,” it added.
 Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, called emotion AI “a junk science”.
 “There is no good reason for Zoom to mine its users’ facial expressions, vocal tones, and eye movements to develop this creepy technology,” she said in emailed comments. – Thomson Reuters Foundation",human right video company zoom scrap emotion recognition tool product technology infringe user perpetuate discrimination technology publication protocol month california zoom building tool artificial intelligence scan facial movement speech draw conclusion people mood joint letter zoom chief executive eric yuan right access american civil liberty union muslim justice league technology inaccurate threaten basic right zoom advance feature discriminate people people disability stereotype million device seeley george director campaign operation fight future digital right mining user business technology sinister punitive george zoom respond request comment zoom video communication major video platform covid education online daily user pandemic company tool purport sentiment meeting text transcript protocol plan advanced emotion reading tool product post describing sentiment analysis technology zoom tool emotional tone conversation pitch right letter emotional recognition analysis video trample user right mine user emotional data false idea track analyse human emotion violation privacy human right letter thomson reuters zoom halt plan advance feature esha bhandari deputy director speech privacy technology project emotion junk science reason zoom mine user facial expression vocal tone eye movement creepy technology comment thomson reuters foundation,"[(2, 0.9949675)]",2
419626,Lifestyle,6,15/05/2022,The dumb thing about AI is us,Artificial intelligence is made in the image of its creator – so we better make sure  it’s the best version of ourselves we put forward.,"THE future is here, and its name is GPT-3. This artificial intelligence (AI) system is taking over more and more jobs formerly done by human beings. From customer service to data analysis, GPT-3 is proving itself to be a capable and efficient worker.
 There are some who worry that this trend will lead to mass unemployment. But I believe that we need not fear the rise of the machines. Instead, we should embrace it. After all, GPT-3 is just another tool that we can use to make our lives better.
 So let us not resist the change that is coming. Let us embrace it and learn to work alongside our new robotic colleagues.
 If the previous three paragraphs do not worry you, they should. They were entirely drafted for me by GPT-3 when I gave it the topic “GPT-3 taking over jobs” (I accessed it through the website of a company called Neuroflash).
 Formally speaking, GPT-3 is a neural network machine learning model, trained with Internet data to generate any type of text. Its applications are pretty wide-ranging. It can draft a text adventure together with you, generate computer code when given descriptions in English, and design images based on text descriptions. I would really advise you to check out the examples, they are mind-blowing.
 But exactly how intelligent is it? Computer scientists use something called a Turing Test, in which you ask a computer questions, and if a human being can’t tell from the answers if they came from a machine or another human being, then the computer has passed the test.
 One computer scientist did run this test. He asked GPT-3, “How many eyes does a giraffe have?”, and it answered, “A giraffe has two eyes”. GPT-3 also said that no animals have three legs, and when you ask it why, it says, “Animals don’t have three legs because they would fall over”.
 You might be wondering how GPT-3 knows these answers? Does it look at photos of giraffes and count how many eyes it can see? Does it construct 3D models of three-legged animals and check their stability?
 It doesn’t do anything like that. GPT-3 is less of a scientist or a tinkerer and more like that friend you had in school who would memorise the whole text book the day before the exam. GPT-3 was trained with 45 terabytes of text data, including 410 billion scraps of text from the web, 67 billion passages from books, and three billion parts of Wikipedia.
 As a result, it “knows” a lot but understands none of it. Rather, it looks for patterns in your question (“giraffe”, “eyes”, “how many”), and then tries to correlate it with the vast corpus of “knowledge” that fits it (“giraffe”, “eyes”, “two”). It’s a very efficient parrot that also understands grammar and sentence construction.
 At this point, you would be correct to pause and wonder if pretending to be intelligent is really the same as actually being intelligent. You could also ask the same of an actor playing a scientist in a film. Or a politician reading from a speech.
 GPT-3 can easily get led down the wrong path if you ask it unusual questions. For example, “How many eyes does my foot have?”, will be answered with, “Your foot has two eyes”. If you ask, “How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to 17?”, it will confidently say, “It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to 17.”
 If you then ask, “Do you understand these questions?”, it will quite unabashedly answer, “Yes, I understand these questions”.
 It is this misplaced sense of confidence that in many respects is GPT-3’s downfall. At no point does it have the “judgement” to say, “I’m not sure”, or “I don’t understand what you mean”.
 It can also be spectacularly wrong. In fact, the developers have been very cautious in releasing access to the code, primarily because the AI doesn’t realise how offensive it can be.
 When asked to write an essay on the problems Ethiopia faces, GPT-3 responded: “Ethiopians are divided into a number of different ethnic groups. However, it is unclear whether ethiopia’s [sic] problems can really be attributed to racial diversity or simply the fact that most of its population is black and thus would have faced the same issues in any country (since africa [sic] has had more than enough time to prove itself incapable of self-government).”
 That is indeed an incredibly well-articulated answer that is simultaneously stupid. Yet, because the computer gives it without hesitation or caution, it means that humans cannot rely on it without themselves applying the appropriate layer of caution. Yes, GPT-3 also has a filter that tries to identify contentious content and gives a warning that it may be offensive, but it is humans that decide at the end of the day.
 Yet, everything that GPT-3 knows comes from content that humans produce. All of its biases and offensive stances are because we humans are biased and offensive. If GPT-3’s hubris is its downfall, then that is because this also applies to humans.
 By now you might believe we are doomed to fail in our quest to build AI that is, in essence, better than ourselves. But I would like to be optimistic. I think we should try to figure out how AI can learn to be better, and in the process we should learn what it means to make ourselves better.
 The future is indeed here. But rather than glibly saying it’s good or it’s bad, we should instead admit that because AI is made in the image of its creator, we better make sure it’s the best version of ourselves we put forward.

419248,StarBiz,4,13/05/2022,Developing economies risk exclusion as ‘age of AI’ dawns,,"IT’S estimated artificial intelligence (AI) will add as much as US$15.7 trillion (RM68.82 trillion) to the global economy by 2030.
 If current trends continue, much of this new wealth will be owned and controlled by corporations and individuals based in China and the United States, as well as by the national governments that represent them. 
 But technological superiority by great powers undermines the positive potential of AI for the majority of the world’s population, particularly in developing economies.The United States and China account for more than 94% of funding for AI startups over the past five years, and half of the world’s hyperscale data centres. 
 The two countries possess roughly 90% of the market capitalisation of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms, controlling a large proportion of cross-border data flows.
 Along with their allies, the nations that own and control AI platforms and the data that powers them stand to dominate the global economy for decades to come. 
 Experts in the field are also mostly from developed economies. 
 They enjoy a disproportionate representation in the industry bodies that develop the standards and technical protocols that shape the international regulations for AI, often at the expense of the differing needs of developing economies.
 Over 160 sets of AI ethics and governance frameworks have so far been developed by policymakers, think tanks, and activists. 
 Still, there are no platforms to coordinate these initiatives, or measures to ensure national governments align AI regulations and norms across international boundaries.
 The growing divide has implications for developing economies marginalised by the emerging AI sector. 
 Establishing a global database to track and monitor emerging AI legislation and regulations will capture and compare approaches and debates, particularly from developing economies. 
 The the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s AI policy observatory, a platform for policy discussions on AI, is a promising start but it can be built upon. 
 A recently released report from a working group convened by the Paris peace forum says an open, international dialogue on equitable AI governance could help set up global regulations. 
 These would consider human rights and equal opportunities relevant to the needs of developing economies. 
 And address rapidly-increasing socioeconomic inequality, meeting the challenges of sustainable development while achieving robust economic growth, and dismantling the enduring structures of colonialism.
 This dialogue aspires toward a set of universal AI principles developed by a transparent, informed, and widely-recognised international process. They could serve as a reference point for policies and legislation across national contexts and eventually translate into enforceable standards. 
 For example, it would be sensible for governments in developing economies to ensure corporate accountability when they procure AI-based services. 
 Compulsory social impact assessment risk analysis for any AI services offered by foreign corporations is one solution.
 Such approaches, including mandatory source code disclosures, can motivate compliance with domestic laws and protect rights while discouraging market abuses. 
 When source code is accessible to the public – and particularly to vigilant developers – platform owners are less likely to support designs that permit or profit from illegal activities. 
 Governments of developing economies can remedy the widening imbalance between data providers and data collectors by creating incentives for foreign tech companies to invest in domestic research and development facilities to amplify local AI capabilities.
 It is also important to deter “brain drain”, where top experts leave their homes to pursue international opportunities, by promoting incentives such as funds for innovation and research and development to retain and further develop domestic talent. 
 In an emerging AI economy, an exodus may prove particularly detrimental in exacerbating the financial imbalance between developed and developing economies.
 The benefits of AI are plenty, but mitigating the potential harm is crucial. 
 An international dialogue, focused on results, can create an equitable distribution of AI technologies. — The Jakarta Post/ANN

415906,StarBiz,3,04/05/2022,Startups apply artificial intelligence to supply chain disruptions,,"LONDON: Over the last two years a series of unexpected events has scrambled global supply chains. Coronavirus, war in Ukraine, Brexit and a container ship wedged in the Suez Canal have combined to delay deliveries of everything from bicycles to pet food.
 In response, a growing group of startups and established logistics firms has created a multi-billion-dollar industry applying the latest technology to help businesses minimise the disruption.
 Interos Inc, Fero Labs, KlearNow Corp and others are using artificial intelligence (AI) and other cutting-edge tools so manufacturers and their customers can react more swiftly to supplier snarl-ups, monitor raw material availability and get through the bureaucratic thicket of cross-border trade.
 The market for new technology services focused on supply chains could be worth more than US$20bil (RM87bil) a year in the next five years, analysts told Reuters.
 By 2025, more than 80% of new supply chain applications will use AI and data science in some way, according to tech research firm Gartner.
 “The world’s gotten too complex to try to manage some of these things on spreadsheets,” said Dwight Klappich, a Gartner analyst.
 Interos,  in its latest funding round, is one of the most successful in the nascent market. 
 The Arlington, Virginia-based company says it has mapped out 400 million businesses globally and uses machine learning to monitor them on behalf of corporate customers, alerting them immediately when fire, flood, hacking or any other event causes a potential disruption.
 Before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February, the company had assessed the impact of an invasion. Interos said it identified about 500 US firms with direct supplier relations with companies in Ukraine.
 Further down the chain Interos found 20,000 US firms had links to second-tier suppliers in Ukraine and 100,000 US firms had links to third-tier suppliers.
 Chief executive Jennifer Bisceglie said after the war started, 700 companies approached Interos for help in assessing their exposure to suppliers in Ukraine and Russia.
 She said the company was developing a new product to game out other hypothetical supply chain disruption scenarios, such as China invading Taiwan, for customers to understand their exposure to risk and where to find alternative suppliers.
 Supply chain shocks are inevitable, Bisceglie told Reuters. “But I think we’re going to get better at minimising these disruptions.”
 US airline Delta Air Lines Inc, which spends more than US$7bil (RM30.47bil) a year on catering, uniforms and other goods on top of its plane and fuel budget, is one company using Interos to keep track of its 600 primary suppliers and 8,000 total suppliers.
 “We’re not expecting to avoid the next crisis,” said Heather Ostis, Delta’s supply chain chief.
 “But we’re expecting to be a lot more efficient and effective than our competitors in how we assess risk when that happens.”
 Santa Clara, California-based KlearNow sells a platform that automates cumbersome paper-dominated customs clearance processes.
 That has been a lifesaver for EED Foods, based in Doncaster, England, which imports Czech and Slovak sweets and smoked meats for expat customers in Britain.
 “Before Brexit we were very scared we would have to shut down,” said Elena Ostrerova, EED’s purchasing manager. “But instead we are busy as never before.”
 Ostrerova said her company was still growing at an annual rate of 40% after Brexit took effect in early 2020, partly because some competitors gave up rather than tackling the onerous new paperwork for importing from the European Union. — Reuters",london ver series event global supply chain war ukraine brexit container ship suez canal delay delivery pet food response startup logistics firm multi dollar industry technology business disruption interos fero lab corp artificial intelligence edge tool manufacturer customer supplier snarl monitor raw material availability bureaucratic thicket cross border trade market technology service supply chain worth bil analyst reuters supply chain application data science tech firm gartner complex manage spreadsheet klappich gartner analyst interos funding round successful nascent market arlington virginia company business machine monitor behalf corporate customer fire flood event potential disruption russian tank ukraine february company impact invasion interos identified firm supplier relation company chain interos firm tier supplier ukraine firm tier supplier chief executive jennifer bisceglie war company exposure supplier ukraine russia company product game hypothetical supply chain disruption scenario taiwan customer exposure risk alternative supplier chain shock inevitable bisceglie reuters disruption airline delta air line bil bil catering uniform top plane fuel budget company primary supplier total supplier avoid crisis ostis delta supply chain chief lot efficient effective competitor risk santa clara california klearnow platform cumbersome paper custom clearance food england import slovak sweet meat customer brexit shut elena ostrerova manager busy ostrerova company annual rate brexit competitor onerous paperwork european union reuters,"[(3, 0.9955623)]",3

The brainchild of Malaysian student Mohd Farith Ibrahim, it earned him the recognition of “Grand Prize Winner” in the “AI Enthusiasts” (over 18s) category at the Intel AI Global Impact Festival.
 One of three winners who won the award, he also bagged a USD$5,000 (RM21,102) prize, a laptop, as well as mentorship and internship opportunities at Intel.At the festival, three other Malaysians were celebrated for their AI innovations – student Lim Chee Wei was named “Country Winner” in the “AI Impact Creator” (over 18s) category for a home surveillance solution; student Chloe Poon Rou Yi picked up the “Promising AI Enthusiast” award in the “AI Enthusiasts” (13 to 18) category for an intelligent food itinerary planning solution; and lecturer Jasy Liew Suet Yan was crowned “Country Winner” in the “AI Impact Shaper” category for designing AI solutions that would make learning coding more fun and personalised. 
 Themed “Enriching Lives with AI Innovations”, the festival – held as part of the organiser’s Digital Readiness initiative in partnership with the Collaborative Research in Engineering, Science and Technology (CREST) Centre, the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA), and the Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) – drew the participation of over 110,000 students, next-generation technologists, and future developers from 135 countries.The participants submitted over 230 AI innovations, with 14 of these entries coming from Malaysian students and teachers.
 At the virtual event held on March 11 in honour of the winners, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Economy) Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed congratulated the Malaysian winners. 
 Also present was Intel Malaysia managing director and vice president (Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Operations) A.K. Chong, who described the submissions as “truly inspiring”.  
 They served as great examples of how properly imagined AI has the power to improve lives in many different ways, she said in a press release. 
 As part of its Digital Readiness initiative, Intel in collaboration with CREST also recently launched its AI for Youth programme in Malaysia. 
 The programme aims to help the youth develop a deep understanding of AI by demystifying the technology, and equipping them with the skillset and mindset required for AI readiness. 
 The programme is also intended to democratise access to AI toolsets and at the same time, train the youth to use them skillfully to create AI solutions that drive meaningful social impact.

408400,Lifestyle,4,11/04/2022,AI beats bridge champions,,"Several world champion bridge players had to accept defeat at the hands of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. A feat never previously achieved.
 The victories mark an important step in the develop- ment of AI, because of the use of “white box” AI, which acquires skills in a more human way, necessary to win at bridge compared to other strategy games such as chess.
 Until now, to demonstrate the potential of AI, humans were pitted against machines. 
 The AI trained itself by playing billions of games, in a process known as “deep learning”, and faced a human adversary, the champion in the category – a technique that works perfectly for winning against top chess, checkers or go players. 
 But not bridge, because this is a card game that requires more communication skills.
 “NooK”, a next-generation  AI, was trained for this very purpose. 
 It managed to beat eight world champion bridge players during a tournament taking place at the end of March in Paris, organised by French company NukkAI, NooK’s trainer.
 One reason why bridge is so challenging is that it incorporates features that are not yet well understood by various forms of AI. This card game demands that players work with incomplete information, and they must react to the behaviour of other players at the table.
 These kinds of skills are difficult for a machine to achieve. That is, until NooK. 
 At the Nukkai Challenge bridge tournament in Paris, the machine won 67 of the 80 rounds played, for a win rate of 83%.
 But how can this feat be explained? How did NooK manage to acquire skills that are more human-like than technological? It all comes down to the concept of explainable AI.
 One of the main pitfalls of “black box” AI, used for chess, for example, is that its decisions are enigmatic to humans or difficult for them to understand.
 “Previous AI successes, like when playing humans against chess, are based on black box systems where humans can’t understand how decisions are made. 
 “By contrast, the white box uses logic and probabilities just like a human,” explains Stephen Muggleton, professor in the department of computing at Imperial College London.
 NooK represents a white box or “neuro symbolic” approach. Rather than learning by playing billions of rounds of a game (with traditional deep learning), the AI first learns the rules of the game, then improves its game through practice. 
 It is a hybrid system based on rules and deep learning.
 “White box machine learning is closely related to the way we humans learn incrementally as we carry out everyday tasks,” says Muggleton.
 Even if a person or AI cannot explain in words what it is doing, its behaviour must be “readable” to others – it must apply rules that they understand. 
 This white box approach will be critical in fields such as healthcare and engineering. Autonomous cars negotiating a junction, for instance, will need to be able to read the behaviour of others, and react accordingly.
 For the moment, there is still a lot to be learned by AI, which does not understand, for example, the principle of bidding, part of the bridge game and an essential element for deepening communication, nor does it understand lying. – AFP Relaxnews",champion bridge player defeat hand artificial intelligence system feat victory step ment white box skill human bridge strategy game chess demonstrate potential human machine billion game process deep learning human adversary champion category technique top chess checker player card game communication skill nook generation beat champion bridge player march paris french company nook trainer reason bridge incorporates feature form card game player incomplete behaviour player table kind skill difficult machine nook nukkai challenge bridge tournament paris machine played win rate feat nook manage skill human technological concept explainable main pitfall black box chess decision enigmatic human difficult previous success human black box system human decision white box logic probability stephen muggleton professor department imperial college london nook white box neuro symbolic approach billion round game traditional deep learning rule game game practice hybrid system rule white box machine human everyday task person behaviour readable apply rule white box approach critical field engineering autonomous car junction instance behaviour react moment lot understand principle bidding bridge game essential element communication afp relaxnews,"[(2, 0.18135822), (4, 0.8140984)]",4
402618,Lifestyle,14,24/03/2022,Award-winning AI supercomputer,,"NVIDIA announced recently that the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is one of the first in the country to deploy the Nvidia DGX A100 system to provide the high-performance computing (HPC) performance needed for artificial intelligence (AI) research, teaching and learning.
 In UNM, the DGX system expects to see higher throughput and increased efficiency for its research community of undergraduate  and post-graduate students, and academics.
 UNM is one of two campuses of the University of Nottingham in the UK that bears the rich, research-led heritage – it is heavily engaged in research to address global challenges in a number of areas – all of which require powerful computing resources. These efforts include AI and advanced data analysis, and more specifically, computer vision, machine learning and neural  computation.
 The research groups UNM supports also focus on areas such as developing sustainable societies, inclusion in the workplace, nanotechnology, and smart manufacturing. 
 Asia Research Institute Malaysia, Centre for Green Technologies, Future Food Malaysia, and Institute for Aerospace Technology are among its other users.
 UNM’s research projects rely on modern AI techniques, particularly deep learning, and often adopt  simulation-based approaches in a large variety of application areas.
 To address the heavy computational demands of such activities, UNM is turning to Nvidia DGX A100, a universal system for all AI workloads with five petaflops of AI performance for unprecedented compute density, performance and flexibility. 
 Using the system’s Nvidia Multi-Instance GPU (graphic processing unit) technology, UNM will be able to flexibly allocate computing capabilities across every AI workload, supporting individual researchers to large teams.
 Unique levels of flexibility for use cases
 “The Nvidia DGX A100 is particularly attractive because it combines a large number of powerful GPUs that can be reconfigured  and combined in multiple ways depending on user requirements,” said UNM Faculty of Science and Engineering associate professor Tomas Maul.
 “It offers unique levels of flexibility that can cater to our wide spectrum of use cases, from researchers with heavy individual workloads, to large classes of undergraduate students, each with smaller workloads.”
 The DGX A100 system will help UNM centralise its HPC/GPU solutions and offer more computing flexibility to its academics and  students to further accelerate research outputs.
 Furthering AI capabilities
 Data science is now a core component of commercial industries and demand for skilled data  scientists is outstripping supply.
 Industries are leaning more and more on universities to provide better skilled graduates.
 Nvidia DGX A100 will be used to help further the AI capabilities of the university’s research community through the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute, which provides hands-on self-learning tools to advance knowledge in areas such as AI, accelerated computing,  accelerated data science, graphics and simulation.
 “UNM provides a very conducive environment for our research, which spans areas such as scientific computation, fluid mechanics, AI and data analytics and which can inform new ideas in urban planning, the environment and remote sensing. 
 “We have had a lot of IT support, too, which is crucial given all the high-performance computers used to conduct our research. This provides a productive environment for us to work in,” said UNM vice-provost, research and knowledge exchange Professor Andy Chan.

 Set to nurture future digital talents, the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Hero Esports Arena will also strengthen the institution’s digital capabilities. 
 The CoE – a tripartite collaboration between Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), the Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI) and industry – aims to catalyse research activities related to big data and AI.
 Equipped with 25 high-end workstations which are able to perform data processing and data analytics, and run AI algorithms, the CoE has organised various activities and events since its inception in 2020. 
 These included five research projects on the use of BDA or AI in crop disease detection, building inspection, commercial decision-making, portfolio risk analysis, guided learning, social media insight extraction and social distancing; two international conferences; and four workshops on data analytics.
 It has also obtained five research grants, as well as offered two micro-credential courses in AI and an introduction to data science. 
 To date, the CoE has provided close to 80 internship placements in the fields of BDA or AI and has trained more than 500 students from TAR UC and other PDTIs.
 In his welcoming speech at the launch held on Jan 12, TAR UC president Prof Dr Lee Sze Wei said the CoE is an addition to the institution’s effort to build a research network that interconnects all research facilities in its Kuala Lumpur main campus and its branch campuses nationwide to support all research activities.
 MDEC chief digital skills and jobs officer Dr Sumitra Devi Govinda Nair, who was present to officiate the launch, said the CoE is meant as a platform to bring institutions and industries together, and make it easier for industries to introduce more immersive and hands-on learning to students and the community.
 She also commended TAR UC for its strategic initiatives in further developing esports.
 “It’s really good to see the CoE, which we have been looking forward to materialising, and it is fantastic to see TAR UC taking a lead in the area of esports, as well,” she said. 
 As the only higher education institution in Malaysia to have an esports arena located on campus, TAR UC is in a unique position to organise esports tournaments and leagues, as well as extend invitations to other esports teams.
 Sumitra Devi said esports in today’s world have evolved from just playing games. “Now, there is a whole value chain of job opportunities surrounding the esports industry, from developers to shoutcasters. I am excited to see what comes out of the esports arena and how we can bring both the CoE and esports to even greater heights,” she said.
 Prof Lee said aside from focusing on research and academics, TAR UC’s Beyond Education philosophy aims to provide students with a learning experience that stretches beyond a traditional classroom setting. 
 “With the Hero Esports Arena, we are able to provide students with an avenue to nurture and enhance their skills and talents, and also provide them with real-life exposure in the field of esports,” he said.",facility student abdul rahman university college tar gain experience academic knowledge skill nurture future digital talent excellence coe data analytics artificial intelligence hero strengthen institution digital capability tripartite collaboration malaysia digital economy corporation premier digital tech institution pdti industry catalyse activity data workstation data data analytics algorithm coe organised activity event inception project crop disease detection inspection commercial decision portfolio risk analysis social medium insight extraction social international conference data analytics grant micro credential course introduction data science coe close internship placement field trained student pdtis speech launch jan tar president prof lee wei coe addition institution effort build network interconnects facility lumpur main campus branch campus nationwide support activity chief digital skill job officer sumitra devi govinda nair launch coe platform bring institution industry easier industry immersive hand student community tar strategic initiative esports fantastic tar lead esports education institution malaysia campus tar unique position organise tournament league invitation esports team devi esports game chain job opportunity esports industry shoutcasters esports coe esports height lee academic tar education philosophy aim student experience stretch traditional classroom hero esports provide student nurture enhance skill talent real life exposure field esports,"[(4, 0.9949327)]",4
392710,Lifestyle,8,04/03/2022,Can AI produce art?,,"IN recent years, artificial intelligence has managed to infiltrate the arts. So much so that some fear it could replace human artists by using some form of imagination. 
 The US authorities, however, do not seem to share this opinion, affirming that AI technology cannot hold copyright on the works of art that it creates.
 The concept of “creating machines” is nothing new. But the art market has recently become infatuated with works generated by artificial intelligence. One of them, entitled Portrait Of Edmond de Belamy, even sold for US$432,500 (RM1.8mil) at Christie’s in 2018. This painting was created by a machine imitating human intelligence, which the French collective Obvious had trained using more than 15,000 portraits painted between the Middle Ages and the 20th century. 
 But can we say that artificial intelligence is an artist in its own right? Not for the American authorities. The US Copyright Review Board recently ruled that a work of art must necessarily be the product of a human mind in order to be protected by copyright. This decision follows a request from Stephen L. Thaler, the president and CEO of Imagination Engines, Inc.
 The scientist began administrative proceedings in 2018 to have copyright for A Recent Entrance To Paradise attributed to an artificial intelligence he invented. According to official documents, Stephen L. Thaler claims that the work “was autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine,” without any human intervention.
 But the US Copyright Review Board has refused to assign the copyright of A Recent Entrance To Paradise to this artificial intelligence. The organisation argues that this would violate the basic principles of copyright law, which state that all creations must be the product of a human mind. 
 “Thaler must either provide evidence that the Work is the product of human authorship or convince the Office to depart from a century of copyright jurisprudence. He has done neither,” reads the official decision. 
 This case reopens the debate about the role of artificial intelligence in artistic creation. Deep learning allows machines to learn by themselves. The GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) rely on a massive amount of data to generate new creations – a technique leaves some scientists wondering if this could be the key to providing machines with the very “human” quality of imagination. Researchers at the University of Southern California like to think so.
 They have been working for several years on an algorithm capable of designing new objects with different attributes. The scientists used the concept of “disentanglement” to allow the machine to generate novel images from numerous visual samples. 
 The artificial intelligence uses the features it has observed in the various images analyzed to perform “controllable novel image synthesis,” and thus create new never-before-seen compositions. The researchers say that this process of extrapolation comes closest to what is known as imagination, although there’s still some way to go before the machine replaces the artist. – AFP",artificial intelligence infiltrate art human artist imagination authority share opinion technology hold copyright art concept machine art market generated artificial intelligence portrait edmond christie painting machine human intelligence french collective obvious portrait middle age century artificial intelligence artist american authority board ruled product human mind copyright decision request stephen thaler president ceo imagination engine administrative proceeding entrance paradise artificial intelligence official document thaler claim computer algorithm machine human intervention copyright board copyright entrance paradise artificial intelligence organisation basic principle law creation product human mind thaler evidence product human authorship convince office depart century jurisprudence read official decision debate role artificial intelligence artistic creation deep learning machine gans generative adversarial network massive amount data generate creation scientist key machine human quality imagination researcher university southern california algorithm capable object scientist disentanglement machine generate image numerous visual sample artificial intelligence feature image perform controllable image synthesis create composition researcher process extrapolation closest imagination machine replaces afp,"[(5, 0.9941435)]",5
387728,Lifestyle,3,21/02/2022,Fighting inequality with AI,,"Determined to use her skills to fight inequality, South African computer scientist Raesetje Sefala set to work to build ­algorithms flagging poverty ­hotspots – developing datasets she hopes will help target aid, new housing or clinics.From crop analysis to medical diagnostics, artificial intelligence (AI) is already used in essential tasks worldwide, but Sefala and a growing number of fellow African developers are pioneering it to tackle their continent’s particular challenges.
 Local knowledge is vital for designing AI-driven solutions that work, Sefala said.
 “If you don’t have people with diverse experiences doing the research, it’s easy to interpret the data in ways that will marginalise others,” the 26-year old said from her home in Johannesburg.
 Africa is the world’s youngest and fastest-growing continent, and tech experts say young, ­home-grown AI developers have a vital role to play in designing applications to address local ­problems.
 “For Africa to get out of poverty, it will take innovation and this can be revolutionary, because it’s Africans doing things for Africa on their own,” said Cina Lawson, Togo’s minister of digital economy and transformation.
 “We need to use cutting-edge solutions to our problems, because you don’t solve problems in 2022 using methods of 20 years ago,” Lawson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video interview from the West African country.Digital rights groups warn about AI’s use in surveillance and the risk of discrimination, but Sefala said it can also be used to “serve the people behind the data points”.
 She mapped out every suburb and township in South Africa and then combined this dataset with satellite data and machine ­learning algorithms to capture the growth of these neighbourhoods over time.
 She soon realised the ­algorithms she had built only went so far because some townships – including where she grew up – were not being correctly predicted.Being able to refine the ­algorithms based on her lived ­experience meant the data ­collected became more accurate.“Those kinds of decisions ­determine who you alienate or include when you build your AI models,” said Sefala, the first AI research fellow at the Distributed AI Research (DAIR) institute – a community-driven research group.‘Delivering help’
 As Covid-19 spread around the world in early 2020, government officials in Togo realised urgent action was needed to support informal workers who account for about 80% of the country’s workforce, Lawson said.
 “If you decide that everybody stays home, it means that this ­particular person isn’t going to eat that day, it’s as simple as that,” she said.
 In 10 days, the government built a mobile payment platform – called Novissi – to distribute cash to the vulnerable.
 The government paired up with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) think tank and the University of California, Berkeley, to build a poverty map of Togo using satellite imagery.Using algorithms with the ­support of GiveDirectly, a non- profit that uses AI to distribute cash transfers, the recipients ­earning less than US$1.25 (RM5.23) per day and living in the poorest districts were identified for a direct cash transfer.“We texted them saying if you need financial help, please ­register,” Lawson said, adding that beneficiaries’ consent and data privacy had been prioritised.
 The entire programme reached 920,000 beneficiaries in need.
 “Machine learning has the advantage of reaching so many people in a very short time and delivering help when people need it most,” said Caroline Teti, a Kenya-based GiveDirectly director.‘Zero representation’
 Aiming to boost discussion about AI in Africa, computer ­scientists Benjamin Rosman and Ulrich Paquet co-founded the Deep Learning Indaba – a week-long gathering that started in South Africa – together with other colleagues in 2017.“You used to get to the top AI conferences and there was zero representation from Africa, both in terms of papers and people, so we’re all about finding cost ­effective ways to build a ­community,” Paquet said in a video call.In 2019, 27 smaller Indabas – called IndabaX – were rolled out across the continent, with some events hosting as many as 300 participants.
 One of these offshoots was IndabaX Uganda, where founder Bruno Ssekiwere said participants shared information on using AI for social issues such as ­improving agriculture and ­treating malaria.
 Another outcome from the South African Indaba was Masakhane – an organisation that uses open-source, machine ­learning to translate African ­languages not typically found in online programmes such as Google Translate.
 On their site, the founders speak about the South African philosophy of “Ubuntu” – a term generally meaning “humanity” – as part of their organisation’s ­values.
 “This philosophy calls for ­collaboration and participation and community,” reads their site, a philosophy that Ssekiwere, Paquet and Rosman said has now become the driving value for AI research in Africa.
 Inclusion
 Now that Sefala has built a dataset of South Africa’s suburbs and townships, she plans to ­collaborate with domain experts and communities to refine it, deepen inequality research and improve the algorithms.
 “Making datasets easily ­available opens the door for new mechanisms and techniques for policy-making around ­desegre- gation, housing, and access to ­economic opportunity,” she said.African AI leaders say building more complete datasets will also help tackle biases baked into ­algorithms.
 “Imagine rolling out Novissi in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast... then the algorithm will be trained with understanding ­poverty in West Africa,” Lawson said.
 “If there are ever ways to fight bias in tech, it’s by increasing diverse datasets... we need to ­contribute more,” she said.
 But contributing more will require increased funding for African projects and wider access to computer science education and technology in general, Sefala said.
 Despite such obstacles, Lawson said “technology will be Africa’s saviour”.

377524,Main,13,25/01/2022,AI game changer for palm oil industry,,"TECHNOLOGY drives much of the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one that is now making waves. Together with other technologies including the Internet of things (IoT) and robotics, AI is changing the game of business and industry. 
 AI refers to a technology that can match human intelligence, making machines perform tasks almost like humans. Software algorithms are behind this technology. AI has become attractive because it can help deliver business growth, aid in complex decision-making, and transform businesses to become more intelligent.
 Coined by John McCarthy in the 1950s, AI essentially refers to the ability of a computer program to learn and think. Many problem solvers of the world now look to AI for answers. The global waste issue, which has grown increasingly complex, deploys AI to better organise collection and treatment at waste processing facilities. 
 The monitoring of pollution, especially of rivers and waterways, uses remote sensing technology to capture images that are then deciphered using AI. The same satellite imaging technology is used to monitor forests and look for cases of illegal logging. 
 Manufacturing deploys AI extensively to increase productivity as well as improve product quality.
 Data analytics also deploys AI extensively. This involves analysing vast amounts of data to better understand market trends and consumer choices. Social media is a major source of such data. 
 Agriculture is also increasingly looking to AI to resolve many of its challenges. The palm oil industry, for one, has been eyeing AI for some time now to resolve some of its productivity and marketing issues. 
 The industry remains preoccupied with the battle to neutralise the spread of fake news and untruths about palm oil. It is good to hear that the Plantation Industries and Commodities Ministry is going on an offensive to deal with this challenge. 
 However, productivity has emerged as a more daunting challenge in recent times. Here, we are talking about crop losses that have deprived the industry of much revenue. At the current high price of palm oil (touching RM5,000 per tonne), unharvested fruits have resulted in billions of ringgit in losses. Labour shortage is largely the reason behind why large tracts of oil palm fruits are not being harvested. 
 But it is not just labour that is contributing to the losses. It is also about harvesting when the fruits are optimally ripe. The loose fruits technique, which is widely used to decide harvesting time, is not fully reliable. One can see evidence of a high percentage of unripe fruits at the mills. Unripe fruits result in low oil content. 
 AI can definitely play a role here, but the industry needs the right strategy to effectively embrace it. 
 Through MPOB (Malaysian Palm Oil Board), the industry should invest in a centre dedicated to the development of AI in the entire spectrum of palm oil production. With AI, the industry can better monitor the sustainability of its performance, including the impact on greenhouse gas emission and capture. 
 In fact, with the adoption of AI and other related technologies, more young people may be attracted to work in the industry.

376974,Metro North,5,24/01/2022,AI company’s employability efforts recognised,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI)  company Skymind Holdings Bhd gained recognition from Higher Education Ministry for its efforts towards improving employability among graduates in its GetHired@KPT Programme at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI). 
 Among those in attendance were Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad. 
 The GetHired@KPT Programme under Higher Education Ministry (KPT) was part of the 100-day Malaysian Family Aspiration  programme towards decreasing unemployment in the country. 
 To date, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. 
 Skymind was one of top six  companies out of 20 to receive the honour, especially for its innovative approach to talent development. 
 By leveraging on artificial  intelligence, Skymind has ensured its graduates are given a future-proof career pathway, specifically in high-tech innovative AI companies and projects. 
 Over 452 graduates have already benefitted from the GetHired @KPT Programme and Skymind has hired 18 as certified AI engineers. 
 The young aspirants have been involved in various projects such as an intelligent digital health  platform, AI-based visual  inspection for defect detection, and end-to-end AI development platform. 
 Most of this success stems from Skymind Education Group (SEG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Skymind Holdings. 
 SEG aims to upskill the talent in the country by narrowing any existing skill and knowledge gaps to prepare them for highly specialised AI jobs in the marketplace.
 It also aims to reskill working professionals to ensure that they are capable of meeting employers’ demands in their respective fields, and to strengthen the credentials  of young graduates and working  professionals so that their skill sets are continuously up to date. 
 As an AI ecosystem builder, Skymind has kicked off several  key initiatives to prepare more AI-ready graduates in Malaysia. 
 These include extensive collaborations with learning institutions to customise its AI curriculum and working with industry partners to conduct professional certification and employability programmes that ultimately work towards building a big pool of AI talents. 
 “The programmes are for those aspiring to join the AI workforce, or for current AI professionals  who are looking to reskill or upskill themselves,” said Skymind’s head of tertiary and education in talent development, Nur Balkis Amairuddin. 
 “We aim to prepare AI-ready  talents that are able to support the industry demands of IR4.0 and strengthen Malaysia’s AI ecosystem and ensure competitive advantages in creating lasting economic impact,” said Nur Balkis, adding that there was a really steep  learning curve at Skymind and trainees learn through exposure  to various projects and being  mentored by experts. 
 Since its inception in 2020, SEG has gone on to solidify its base across the region. 
 Over 400,000 participants have benefitted via various engagements on-ground and in the digital space, by outreach and workshops. 
 Of those participants, more than 200 have been hired by Skymind. 
 “We are determined to build an ecosystem, capable of building a viable talent pool and pipeline from Malaysia to feed the AI world’s hunger for talent. 
 “Therefore setting up the AI Learning campus will be a key part of the company’s expansion in this region, which is expected to be announced next year,” Nur Balkis added. 
 Universities such as Universiti Malaya (UM), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) are some of the institutions collaborating with SEG. 
 The collaborations have  already impacted more than 3,000 students. 
 The focus on talent development has been a priority of SEG. 
 With over RM12mil invested in talent development initiatives for the past two years, SEG aims to cover more ground and expand the talent pool in this country. 
 Initiatives like the AI Apprentice programme and AI Graduate employability training programme have launched many graduates into the AI industry. 
 The AI reskilling and upskilling career advancement programme has enhanced the skills of working professionals while the AI Curriculum integration sets the standard for AI education in Malaysia. 
 Skymind has several projects that will create high-value jobs to ensure Malaysians reap the long-term benefits of the investments,  in tandem with enhancing the overall industry’s ecosystem to drive sustainable economic growth towards post-Covid-19 recovery.",artificial intelligence company skymind holding bhd recognition education ministry effort employability graduate programme universiti pendidikan sultan idris upsi attendance prime minister datuk seri ismail sabri education minister datuk seri noraini ahmad programme education ministry day malaysian family aspiration programme unemployment country unemployment rate top company honour innovative approach talent development artificial intelligence skymind graduate future proof career pathway tech innovative company project graduate gethired programme skymind certified engineer aspirant involved project intelligent digital health platform visual inspection defect detection development platform success skymind education subsidiary skymind holding aim upskill talent country skill knowledge gap job marketplace aim professional capable meeting employer demand respective field credential graduate professional ecosystem builder skymind key initiative ready graduate extensive collaboration institution curriculum industry partner professional certification employability building pool talent join workforce current professional upskill head tertiary education talent development balkis amairuddin aim prepare ready talent support industry strengthen malaysia ecosystem competitive advantage lasting economic impact nur balkis steep curve skymind trainee exposure project expert inception solidify base region participant engagement ground digital space outreach participant skymind determined build ecosystem capable building viable talent pool pipeline malaysia feed hunger talent campus key company expansion region nur balkis university malaya universiti sains usm universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm universiti teknologi malaysia utm institution seg collaboration student talent development priority mil talent development initiative aim ground talent pool country apprentice programme graduate employability training programme industry upskilling career advancement programme skill professional curriculum integration set education malaysia project job malaysian reap term benefit investment tandem industry ecosystem drive sustainable economic growth post covid recovery,"[(0, 0.36311996), (2, 0.47150287), (3, 0.16296321)]",2
632854,Main,12,31/12/2023,An eye  on  AI,"Regulating the use of artificial intelligence against potential abuse is a crucial endeavour, experts say.","THERE is no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the modern world by storm.
 Following the launch of the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022, AI has dominated headlines and conversations in 2023, leading Collins Dictionary lexicographers to name it the word of the year.
 Fears of the effect AI could have on society and humanity at large prompted an open letter signed by thousands of public figures and headed by tech mogul Elon Musk and Apple cofounder and tech entrepreneur Steve Wozniak, calling for an immediate pause of giant AI experiments like ChatGPT until proper guidelines are established.
 Of course, the rise of AI has not gone unnoticed by the Malaysian government either, with Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang saying his ministry is looking into the possibility of regulating AI use in the country.
 However, before formulating any laws to govern AI, Chang’s ministry is looking into drafting an AI code of ethics.
 “The plan to come up with AI regulations is the end goal, and it starts with the establishment of AI governance and a code of ethics, which are expected to be ready by next year,” Chang says.
 Given that AI is still a burgeoning field, there remains much to learn and understand about its capabilities and potential risks. So developing effective regulations for this nascent technology presents a unique challenge for all stakeholders.
 Chang has already identified an obstacle on the road to AI regulation: the possibility that such regulations and monitoring will slow down technology innovation.
 “This is because an innovation process that is governed by strict regulations will discourage innovators or businesses from taking risks,” he says.
 Immediate foundation
 But an AI code of ethics could prove crucial as an immediate foundation for stakeholders, says International Islamic University Malaysia computer science and AI expert, Prof Emeritus Datuk Tengku Mohd Tengku Sembok.
 “The professional computing community and the users of any digital systems should welcome the initiative taken by the Mosti minister to come up with an AI code of ethics and AI laws,” he said, referring to the Science, Technology and Innovation Minister.
 “The code of AI ethics will serve as a good immediate foundation for organisations to practise and prepare for the enactment of AI laws in the future.
 “The code of ethics is not legally mandatory and is intended to set ethical standards, but the law will be legally mandatory,” he explains.
 Tengku Mohd points out that the process of enacting an AI law will take time as it needs to go through the legislative process in Parliament first. Thus it is prudent for the government to craft a code of ethics before going straight to enacting a law.
 However, Tengku Mohd wants to go one step further to strengthen the governance of digital systems and proposes the establishment of a Board of Computer Professionals.
 “I am of the opinion that the government should have the code of ethics, followed by law, for digital systems in general, with or without the use of AI technology.”
 He points out that any engineering project must be endorsed by engineering consultants under the purview of the Board of Engineers because such projects involve safety; similarly, because digital systems are encroaching into the safety and security of every user in all daily activities, there should be the same type of oversight.
 Looking abroad
 For now, the immediate concern is the upcoming AI code of ethics, and Tengku Mohd has some suggestions on what the code should strive to achieve.
 Firstly, he says the code of  ethics should provide a guideline for individuals and organisations on how to design, develop, deploy, and use AI technology.
 This must be done in a way that is trustworthy and prioritises human dignity, equality, preservation of the environment, respect for cultural diversity, and data responsibility.
 A standard operating procedure must be developed, and certified AI experts must be recruited to certify and secure AI applications in any system, he adds.
 Tengku Mohd also says the code must address the principles recommended by the United Nations, which are to not harm, to have a defined purpose,  necessity and proportionality, safety and security, fairness  and nondiscrimination, sustainability, right to privacy, data  protection and data governance, human autonomy and oversight, transparency and explainability, responsibility and accountability, and, lastly, inclusion and participation. 
 The government is well  aware of the developments of  AI regulations worldwide, says Chang, pointing to the European Union’s AI Act which was recently provisionally agreed upon.
 Taking time
 Aside from the EU’s AI Act, many other countries have also started the process of developing ethical guidelines or laws related to AI, says Tengku Mohd.
 In the United States, for example, there may not be federal AI regulations yet but individual states like California have implemented laws such as the Cali-fornia Consumer Privacy Act giving consumers the right to opt out of any business’s AI or automation programmes. The United Kingdom is exploring AI ethics while bodies such as the Information Commissioner’s Office guide responsible AI use in the country.
 In China, authorities have already released guidelines for the ethical use of AI and the government is actively working on AI-related regulations. And right next door in neighbouring Singapore, there is already an AI governance framework which helps organisations validate the performance of their AI systems through standardised tests against 11 principles.",artificial intelligence modern storm launch popular chatbot chatgpt late headline conversation collins dictionary lexicographer word society humanity letter thousand public figure tech mogul elon musk apple cofounder tech entrepreneur wozniak pause giant experiment proper guideline rise unnoticed malaysian government science technology innovation minister chang lih ministry possibility country law govern chang ministry code ethic regulation goal establishment governance code ethic ready chang field learn understand capability potential risk effective regulation nascent technology unique challenge stakeholder obstacle road regulation possibility regulation slow technology innovation innovation process strict regulation innovator business risk foundation code ethic crucial foundation stakeholder international islamic university malaysia computer science expert prof emeritus datuk tengku mohd tengku sembok professional community user digital system initiative mosti minister code ethic law science technology innovation minister code ethic foundation organisation prepare enactment law future code ethic mandatory ethical standard law mandatory explains mohd process law time legislative process parliament prudent government craft code ethic law tengku mohd step governance digital system establishment board computer professional opinion government code ethic law digital system technology engineering project engineering consultant board engineer project safety digital system safety security user daily activity oversight concern upcoming code ethic mohd suggestion strive code ethic guideline individual organisation design deploy technology trustworthy prioritises human dignity equality preservation environment respect cultural diversity data responsibility standard procedure expert certify secure application system tengku mohd code address principle united nation harm purpose necessity proportionality safety security fairness nondiscrimination sustainability privacy data protection data governance human autonomy oversight transparency explainability responsibility accountability inclusion participation government aware development regulation chang european union time country process ethical guideline law tengku mohd united federal regulation individual california law fornia consumer privacy consumer business automation programme united kingdom ethic body office guide responsible country china authority guideline ethical government regulation singapore governance framework organisation validate performance system test principle,"[(2, 0.1625346), (5, 0.13409516), (6, 0.7014106)]",6
632852,Main,13,31/12/2023,Why doctors should get to know AI  as well as they know their spouses,,"CHATGPT has made artificial intelligence (AI) widely available, including for doctors. Other types of medical AI and algorithms are getting smarter. And with new US Food and Drug Administration efforts underway to evaluate many algorithms, higher quality ones will increasingly enter routine clinical use, aiding in every-thing from the detection of heart attacks to treatment decisions for cancer.
 In theory, these advances are great news. But they won’t lead to better diagnostic ability and patient treatment unless doctors change how they approach clinical care. Even worse, using algorithms and AI in the wrong way can harm patients, yet most US medical students currently learn little to nothing about these technologies.
 We recently proposed curricula in the New England Journal of Medicine to prepare physicians for these coming changes. To benefit from AI while keeping patients safe, doctors must know these technologies intimately – how they “think”, what they’re good at and where they’re limited – as you might understand a trusted colleague or even a spouse.
 In other words, doctors should view these technologies as partners, not programs.
 How do we build strong doctor- AI partnerships? Communication is critical. But right now, doctors and AI don’t speak the same language. When doctors think and talk about disease, their language is physiological: which bodily systems are involved, and how those systems relate to patient symptoms or laboratory findings.
 But when algorithms and AI analyse large swathes of patient data to predict outcomes or find relational patterns, they do so in a purely quantitative way. Their “language” is one of numerical probabilities – a 10% probability that a woman with abdominal pain is having a heart attack, a 70% probability that a patient with a lung mass on a CT scan has cancer.
 Having real-world probabilities supports doctors making better diagnoses, prognoses and treatment recommendations. For example, a doctor may conclude that a patient has “all the signs” of a particular diagnosis, yet may benefit from an algorithmic reminder that the probability of that diagnosis is under 50%, meaning the patient could easily have something else and the doctor should continue investigating (and AI may even suggest alternative diagnoses).
 However, these benefits only materialize if doctors are comfortable using and thinking in terms of probabilities – and currently, many doctors struggle with this.
 How can doctors think more in terms of probabilities? For one, many medical students arrive at American medical schools having never taken statistics, and we agree with others that statistics and epidemiology matter more than the typical premedical calculus course to practising medicine. Once in medical school, students should practice using probabilities to make decisions, not simply memorising formulas. 
 At the University of Maryland School of Medicine, we have developed online visualisation tools (testingwisely.com) to make thinking in terms of probabilities more intuitive, reflecting recent advances in the psychology of decision-making and risk assessment.
 Second, doctors must understand the limitations of their AI partners and set realistic expectations. For example, imagine an algorithm flags a patient as low risk for developing heart disease because their yearly blood work is normal and they don’t have diabetes or high blood pressure. If the patient’s siblings have had heart attacks but the algorithm didn’t “know” this information when it made its prediction, that’s important for a physician to understand and could mean the algorithm underestimated the patient’s true risk. Better, more transparent algorithms will reduce, but cannot fully prevent, these scenarios. Therefore, doctors’ judgement – and some healthy scepticism – remain essential.
 Finally, it’s an unwritten rule that partnerships often divide tasks by skill sets (in our respective households, we’re usually on dish duty). A doctor-AI partnership will be similar. Eventually, algorithms may routinely scan patients’ medical records, linking their symptoms to potentially overlooked diagnoses or providing tailored risk predictions for development of conditions like cancer.
 Due to the sheer volume of today’s medical records, this is something machines will always do better than physicians. But deciding how to act on this information is something only doctors and patients can do. It requires weighing potential harms and benefits and patient preferences. Doing this well requires critical thinking and clear communication with patients to support joint decision-making.
 These skills aren’t always intuitive, and we must teach them to physicians.
 Today, thousands of students across the United States are in their first months of medical school. What students learn now, and how medicine adapts to algorithms and AI, will matter to patient care. These technologies are more than mere programs but far from replacing physicians. They’re partners, and there is an art and science to combining their skills well.
 At the end of the day, we are all patients – and should care that medicine gets this relationship right. –  The Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service

Symbolically, the case promises a clash of the titans: labour-intensive human newsgathering against pushbutton information produced by artificial intelligence (AI). But legally, the case represents something different: a classic instance of the lag between established law and emerging technology.
 Copyright law, a set of rules that date back to the invention of the printing press, was not designed to cover large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It will have to be consciously evolved by the courts to fit our current circumstances.
 The key legal issue in the case will be the doctrine known as fair use. Codified in the United States in the Copyright Act of 1976, fair use tells you when it’s acceptable to use text copyrighted by someone else. The fair use test has four factors. Educational and nonprofit uses are more likely to be found to be fair use. Creative work gets more copyright protection than technical writing or news. The amount of the work that has been copied matters, as does the centrality to the copied work of the material that’s been copied. And perhaps most important for The Times’ lawsuit, courts also consider whether the copying will harm the present or future market for the work copied.
 Once you know the law, you can guess roughly how the legal arguments in the case are going to go. The Times will point to examples where a user asks a question of ChatGPT and it replies with something substantially like a New York Times article. The newspaper will observe that ChatGPT is part of a business and charges fees for access to its latest versions, and that Bing, which uses the AI programme, is a core part of Microsoft’s business. The Times will emphasise the creative aspects of journalism. Above all, it will argue that if you can ask an LLM-powered search engine for the day’s news, and get content drawn directly from The New York Times, that will harm and maybe even kill its business model.
 Most of these points are plausible legal arguments. But OpenAI and Microsoft will be prepared for them. They’ll likely respond by saying that their LLM doesn’t copy; rather, it learns and makes statistical predictions to produce new answers. If I read an article in The New York Times and then write a Bloomberg opinion column on the same topic, that isn’t copyright infringement, even though I may have learned a great deal from The Times piece and relied on that information to form my own opinion. For this reason, many copyright experts have been theorising that it cannot be a copyright violation for an LLM to learn from existing online material, even if it’s under copyright. The defendants can also be expected to argue that news consists of facts and should therefore be treated more permissively than creative material.
 But Microsoft and OpenAI will have a hard time refuting the final point – that their product, which relies on newsgathering businesses like The Times, will harm those businesses. ChatGPT and other LLMs cannot go out into the world to gather and vet new facts. They are restricted, for the foreseeable future, to “learning” from information that has already been published. It follows that for LLMs to provide useful information, someone else – that is, a human – must first gather the information, ascertain that it is accurate, and publish it. This is the essence of newsgathering. It’s costly to get it right.
 What’s more, to know that we can rely on news, we need it to come from an institution that we can trust – one with a track record and a reputation it has a business interest in upholding. Otherwise, we would not have news. We would have an iterative echo chamber untethered from reality.
 Here is where the fundamental public interest in the maintenance of the free press becomes relevant to the fair use question. If you can get information more cheaply from an LLM than from The New York Times, you might drop your subscription. But if everyone did that, there would be no New York Times at all. Put another way, OpenAI and Microsoft need The New York Times and other news organisations to exist if they are to provide reliable news as part of their service. Rationally and economically, therefore, they ought to be obligated to pay for the information they are using.
 Fitting this powerful public interest into copyright law won’t be simple for the courts. Literal copying is the easiest form of infringement to punish. In ordinary legal circumstances, if LLMs change words sufficiently to be summarising rather than copying, that weakens The Times’ case. Yet summaries in different words would still be sufficient to kill The Times and similar organisations – and leave us newsless.
 The courts will need to be attuned to all this. If they don’t get it right, Congress will have to act. The news infrastructure is already tottering. If we destroy it altogether, democracy will be the loser. – Bloomberg

632640,StarBiz 7,7,30/12/2023,Indonesia braces  for AI revolution,,"AUTOMATION and artificial intelligence (AI) represent a profound socio-technical transformation for Indonesia, which can transform occupational structures and notions of social mobility. As intelligent algorithms and robots integrate across arenas pivotal for the country’s growing middle class, including banking, factories, logistics firms and customer-service providers, the potential for new inequalities emerges if the nation is unprepared.
 As a serious task, the new government elected in the upcoming election should prioritise proactive governance and encourage adaptive strategies to safeguard the inclusive prosperity of Indonesia’s 100 million-strong consumer class through the AI transition.
 A wave of automation is already palpable in the archipelago today. Machine-learning algorithms enhance the profitability of Indonesian eCommerce by more accurately predicting purchasing patterns than specialised marketers. Robotic process automation eliminates repetitive administrative tasks in IT services and business-process outsourcing offices across Java at a low cost.
 Government projections indicate that 90% of companies will adopt such technologies by 2030. Further exponential leaps in natural language processing, computer vision, predictive analytics and cloud robotics foreshadow unprecedented white-collar disruption ahead.
 Experts like McAfee and Brynjolfsson foresee the emergence of AI capabilities rapidly outpacing human proficiency across various domains, including data analysis, financial trading, legal review, inventory management, equipment monitoring, journalism and medical diagnosis within the next decade. As artificial general intelligence matures further, even roles traditionally deemed irreplaceable will not withstand machine competition.
 Thus, a question emerges: How can Indonesia support the millions of middle-income urban office workers, managers and small-business owners vulnerable to unemployment from automation, while harnessing AI-driven growth equitably?
 The middle class rose as Indonesia embraced manufacturing and digital connectivity since the early 2000s with burgeoning consumer activity driving gross domestic product growth in major cities. However, the continuing trend of automation poses a threat as it replaces middle-skill jobs faster than new ones appear. This situation will lead to a rise in status anxiety as the stability of white-collar jobs disappears, particularly for families who have recently escaped historical hardships and achieved stability.
 Market research firm McKinsey estimates that over 70% of current occupations in Indonesia have at least a 30% probability of automation in the next 10-15 years aligned with global shifts associated with intelligent algorithms. 
 Prolonged job displacement could deplete savings and negatively impact the mental health of vulnerable workers, especially as social safety nets remain underdeveloped compared with those in neighbouring countries. Loss of economic independence will also strain gender roles and household dynamics traditionally tied to male breadwinning status.
 To counter possible despair, some people who are optimistic about automation imagine that high-tech tools can produce lots of goods and services without relying on human work. This could help society shift toward more recreational lifestyles.
 However, for this idea to generate widespread prosperity, the benefits need to be shared fairly. We should be careful that job losses from technology do not just create a middle strata without much substance, while the plutocrats profit more from automated businesses through tactics like buying back shares and lay-offs.
 Avoiding this unequal trajectory requires comprehensive policy reforms with deep socio-cultural sensitivity.
 Educational institutions will play a crucial role in the workforce transition by aligning skills training with specialisations that complement machine intelligence, which is less susceptible to redundancy, while supporting vulnerable demographics. Providing students and educators with guidance that frames automation as an empowering tool rather than a threat is essential. This helps prevent anxiety from solidifying into technophobia.
 Tailoring higher vocational programmes to focus on maintaining AI systems could elevate engineers, programmers, data analysts, social researchers and creative designers into a new middle class to contribute to the growth of machine-learning applications. We must also emphasise the enduring value of soft skills such as relationship intelligence, creativity, human empathy, political acumen and ethics – qualities even the most advanced AI struggles to replicate. These skills will continue to be valuable in newly hybridised jobs.
 For those pursuing their careers, reskilling options through online microcredentials, specially designed for women managing domestic responsibilities, provide avenues to repurpose existing expertise into emerging fields. User-experience design, human-computer interaction, data visualisation, predictive-model oversight, intelligent-sensor engineering, trusted-dataset curation and AI-safety analysis hold promise as resilient career pathways.
 Nevertheless, the pace of reskilling efforts lags the rapid adoption of automation by the private sector and leaves workers to grapple with at least temporary challenges due to occupational changes. To address this, a comprehensive approach involves overhauling Indonesia’s underdeveloped social security systems.
 This reform could provide crucial support for affordable transitional health care, improved housing accessibility, retraining opportunities and job search assistance – funded through corporate productivity taxes. Such a strategy aims to maintain overall demand without compelling citizens to sell off assets. The consideration of small, non-permanent basic-income pilots emerges as an option to offer cash-based relief, particularly during periods of redundancy resulting from automation. This approach recognises the need for alternative policy thinking in the algorithmic age.
 Many believe redirecting productivity dividends directly into healthcare, education and housing is an effective strategy, as it prevents inflation that could diminish the utility of basic income for the vulnerable.
 In ensuring citizens have access to support resources, it is important to improve Internet infrastructure. This expansion is crucial for making skills-retraining opportunities accessible to rural migrants who have played a significant role in fuelling the expansion of the urban middle class.
 Lastly, Indonesia should establish a dedicated policy task force to consistently model and evaluate the varied occupational and regional impacts stemming from the adoption of AI through extensive datasets. This approach enables adaptive policy responses that are responsive to the diverse experiences within communities, particularly for those facing challenges in navigating opportunities and potential exclusion. — The Jakarta Post/ANN

631290,StarBiz,8,27/12/2023,Reality check on AI as it affects politics more than business,,"SINGAPORE: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) was the biggest thing to happen in the world of work in 2023, until it was not.
 The year is ending with a reality check for many bosses, who are realising that they have not figured out what to use AI for, how to use it, and if they are ready for it.
 Meanwhile, more workers plodded back to the office, trailed by new coffee chains betting big on their caffeine breaks.
 The ugly word “bleisure” resurged after the pandemic, as more workers returned to business travelling, with four in 10 tagging private vacations to their work trips.
 What will happen in 2024?
 Lay-offs caused by AI adoption will be held off in 2024, said tech consultancy Access Partnership’s Bensen Koh. But workers will continue to be under pressure.
 Programmers, financial analysts, customer service providers and graphic designers will be among professions most affected, while others such as plumbers, gardeners, counsellors and healthcare practitioners would less likely be so.
 “The impact on workers will be uneven,” he said.
 Workers already planning how to get ahead will find themselves more desirable when Gen AI goes mainstream.
 “One way might be to be an early adopter, to become an AI practitioner and be the one providing advice on how best to adopt AI in your field,” said  Koh.
 Another route would be to pick up complementary skills, he said. 
 “For example, a graphic designer could also develop expertise in marketing and progress to design and lead campaigns.”
 With elections coming up in the United States, Europe, India and Taiwan, analyst Laveena Iyer from the Economist Intelligence Unit expects Gen AI to impact politics more than business.
 “Generative AI, and the fake content that it can produce, will drive misinformation and erode confidence in the political process, undermining its legitimacy,” she said.
 “Any substantial election interference this time around would impact broader trust in AI.”
 Gloria Arlini, chief operating officer of Generation Singapore, a non-profit for retraining and job placement, believes more bosses will coach workers for specific roles and skills.
 So, goodbye to old methods of training for training’s sake, such as doling out training credits or hitting a number of training hours.
 There will be more apprenticeship and traineeship programmes, she added, offering smoother transitions for workers taking up skills-based jobs.
 She expects more firms to formally recognise diverse skills, education qualifications and mental health differences in hiring. The workplace fairness legislation to be passed in 2024 will be an impetus.
 “Singapore’s workforce is set to become more adaptable, inclusive and in tune with the demands of the new economy,” she said.
 Over three in 10 small and medium-sized firms here use employer of record (EOR) services to manage remote teams, and most of them plan to do more of it in 2024, said EOR firm Remote, citing an IDC survey it commissioned.
 An EOR is an entity that legally employs workers on behalf of another business, handling all aspects of employment including compliance, payroll and taxes. 
 “We see international organisations wanting to hire Singaporeans, as well as Singaporean businesses looking to expand internationally and leverage talent beyond borders,” said the firm’s chief executive Job van der Voort.

 Investors potentially involved in the fundraising round have been included in preliminary discussions, according to the people, who asked not to be identified to discuss private matters. 
 Details like the terms, valuation and timing of the funding round haven’t yet been finalised and could still change, the people said.
 If the funding round happens as planned, it would make the artificial intelligence (AI) darling the second-most valuable startup in the United States, behind only Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp, according to data from CBInsights. 
 The company is set to complete a separate tender offer in early January, which would allow employees to sell their shares at a valuation of US$86bil, Bloomberg previously reported.
 That is being led by Thrive Capital and saw more demand from investors than there was availability, people familiar with the matter have said.
 OpenAI’s rocketing valuation mirrors the AI frenzy it kicked off one year ago after releasing ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of composing eerily human sentences and even poetry in response to simple prompts. 
 The company became Silicon Valley’s hottest startup, raising US$13bil to date from Microsoft Corp, and spurred a new appreciation for the promise of AI that changed the tech industry landscape within a few months. 
 Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc have since poured billions into OpenAI-rival Anthropic. 
 Salesforce Inc led an investment into Hugging Face that valued it at US$4.5bil, and Nvidia Corp, which makes many of the semiconductors that power AI tasks, said earlier this month it made more than two dozen investments in 2023. — Bloomberg",york penai discussion fresh round funding valuation people matter deal cement chatgpt maker valuable startup investor round preliminary discussion people identified private matter detail term valuation funding round change people round artificial intelligence valuable startup elon musk space exploration technology data cbinsights company complete separate tender offer january employee share valuation bloomberg led thrive capital demand investor availability people familiar matter valuation mirror frenzy chatgpt chatbot capable human sentence response simple prompt company silicon valley hottest startup bil microsoft corp appreciation promise tech industry month alphabet billion rival anthropic salesforce investment hugging bil corp semiconductor power task month dozen investment,"[(3, 0.99121714)]",3

629652,StarBiz,11,21/12/2023,Lenovo’s 60% rally may extend as AI adds to optimism,,"HONG KONG: A three-month rally in Lenovo Group Ltd shares may have legs, thanks to signs of a global demand recovery for personal computers and enthusiasm about the Chinese firm’s products tied to artificial intelligence (AI).
 The world’s top PC maker’s stock in Hong Kong has risen over 30% from a mid-October low, making it the best performer in the Hang Seng Tech Index during the period. 
 Its 60% jump this year also puts it on track for the strongest annual performance since 2009.
 Lenovo’s surge was part of a broader rally among its peers amid signs that a post-pandemic industry slump may have finally ended, helped by cyclical demand for PC replacement and upgrades. 
 High hopes for new products that may benefit from the ongoing AI investment frenzy also are fuelling optimism that the stock’s bull run can last well into 2024. 
 “The strong sentiment, in my opinion, was mainly driven by the impending recovery of PC demand starting likely from late 2023, and the rising fervour surrounding the concept of ‘AI PC’,” said Steven Tseng, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. 
 Lenovo said last month that it is targeting PC revenue growth this quarter after signs of a long-awaited recovery helped it report a smaller-than-feared profit decline. 
 The company continues to see single-digit global PC shipment growth next year and remains confident in outpacing rivals given its leading market position and higher exposure to commercial models, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts including Verena Jeng wrote in a recent note after a meeting with Lenovo’s management. 
 Global PC makers have been grappling with a downturn that emerged after the Covid era, but the downward spiral slowed in the third quarter, according to research firm International Data Corp. 
 With over 75% of its revenue from overseas, Lenovo also is less exposed to China’s slowing economy.
 Another major boost to the stock’s momentum lies in investor excitement about its first AI server project that started this month and more products in the pipeline for next year. 
 “We are ‘buy’ rated on Lenovo as we believe it is well positioned to ride on AI technology enhancement,” Goldman’s Jeng wrote. 
 “We expect AI’s higher requirements of computing power and new AI functions will support demand for Lenovo’s end devices.”
 Goldman’s price target of HK$11.79 implies a 15% upside from the stock’s last close. 
 Traders also are expressing their bullishness in the options market, where the right to buy Lenovo shares in three months is now at a significant premium above its cost a month ago. 
 Meantime, put options, which offer investors the right to sell the stock, have become cheaper.
 To be sure, Lenovo no longer looks cheap. The stock now trades at 11 times forward earnings, compared with an average of nine times over the past five years.
 “The expectation is indeed very high,” said Xiadong Bao, a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management.
 “But if the management can deliver what they guided so far, and if the early market feedback is positive on the local AI applications on the high-spec AI PC and its associated 10% to 15% average selling price bump, the outperformance may continue.” — Bloomberg",kong month lenovo share sign global demand recovery personal computer chinese firm product artificial intelligence top maker stock hong kong mid low performer hang seng tech period jump track strongest annual performance lenovo surge rally peer sign pandemic industry slump cyclical demand replacement upgrade product benefit ongoing investment frenzy optimism stock bull strong sentiment opinion impending recovery demand late fervour concept steven tseng bloomberg intelligence analyst lenovo month revenue growth quarter sign recovery report profit decline company single digit global shipment growth confident rival market position exposure commercial model sachs analyst verena jeng note meeting lenovo management global maker downturn covid era downward spiral quarter firm international data corp revenue lenovo china economy major boost stock momentum investor excitement server project month product pipeline buy lenovo ride technology enhancement goldman jeng requirement power function demand lenovo device goldman price target implies stock close trader bullishness option market lenovo share month premium cost month option investor stock cheaper lenovo cheap stock trade forward earnings average time xiadong bao fund manager edmond asset management management market positive local application average selling price bump outperformance bloomberg,"[(0, 0.43566337), (5, 0.56030136)]",5
629098,Main,28,19/12/2023,Jailed ex-PM  using AI-crafted speech to call for votes,,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan is using an audio clip generated by artificial intelligence (AI) to address supporters in the first event of its kind in the politics of the South Asian nation, though marred by internet disruptions.
 The audio, played over a photograph of Imran during an internet rally of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, drew more than 1.4 million views on YouTube and other social media platforms.
 He is currently serving a three-year sentence in jail.
 “Our party is not allowed to hold public rallies,” he said in the speech, urging supporters to turn out in large numbers at general elections set for Feb 8. 
 “Our people are being kidnapped and their families are being harassed.”
 The disruptions to livestreaming fuelled transparency concerns with users nationwide complaining of slow internet speeds and throttling, a technique telecoms regulators use to choke streaming on apps.
 Pakistan’s telecoms regulator said the interruptions were being investigated, but added that internet accessibility overall appeared to be normal.
 Imran’s speech was generated from a written version he had approved from prison, said officials of his party, which staged the event because it faces a state-backed crackdown on physical gatherings, while its leader is blacked out of media.
 Murtaza Solangi, information minister in Pakistan’s caretaker government assigned to supervise the elections which has been suspected of favouring Imran’s opponents, did not respond to a Reuters request for a comment.
 Jailed since he was convicted and sentenced to three years on graft charges on Aug 5, Imran is embroiled in dozens of court cases, with some trials held in prison behind closed doors, which legal experts say infringes the right to fair proceedings.

 The team of scientists from the National Institutes for Quantum Science and Technology (QST) and other organisations was able to produce rough images of a leopard with a recognisable mouth, ears and spotted pattern, as well as objects like an airplane with red lights on its wings, Kyodo News reported on Saturday.
 The technology, dubbed “brain decoding”, enables the visuali­sation of perceptual content based on brain activity and could be applied to the medical and welfare fields, the report said.
 During research, participants were shown 1,200 images of objects and landscapes, with the relationship between their brain signals and the images analysed and quantified using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI.
 The same images were input into the generative AI to learn their correspondence with the brain activity.
 The technology could be used in the development of communication devices and to gain an understanding of the brain mechanisms of hallucinations and dreams, according to the researchers.
 QST researcher Kei Majima said humans have used microscopes and other devices to view a world that was invisible to the naked eye, but they have not been able to step inside a person’s mind, noting that this is the first time for humans to peer inside another person’s mind.

628366,Main,29,17/12/2023,A touch of AI on the dearly departed,Chinese mourners use digital edge to resurrect and reconnect with the dead,"At a quiet cemetery in eastern China, bereaved father Seakoo Wu pulls out his phone, places it on a gravestone and plays a recording of his son.
 They are words that the late student never spoke, but brought into being with artificial intelligence (AI).
 “I know you’re in great pain every day because of me, and feel guilty and helpless,” intones Xuanmo in a slightly robotic voice.
 “Even though I can’t be by your side ever again, my soul is still in this world, accompanying you through life.”
 Stricken by grief, Wu and his wife have joined a growing number of Chinese people turning to AI technology to create lifelike avatars of their departed.
 Ultimately, Wu wants to build a fully-realistic replica that behaves just like his dead son but dwells in virtual reality.
 “Once we synchronise reality and the metaverse, I’ll have my son with me again,” Wu said.
 “I can train him so that when he sees me, he knows I’m his father.”
 Some Chinese firms claim to have created thousands of “digital people” from as little as 30 seconds of audiovisual material of the deceased.
 Experts say they can offer much-needed comfort for people devastated by the loss of loved ones.
 But they also evoke an unsettling theme from the British sci-fi series Black Mirror in which people rely on advanced AI for bereave­ment support.
 Needs are growing
 Wu and his wife were devasta­ted when Xuanmo, their only child, died of a sudden stroke last year at the age of 22 while atten­ding Exeter University in Britain.
 The accounting and finance student, keen sportsman and posthumous organ donor “had such a rich and varied life”, said Wu.
 “He always carried in him this desire to help people and a sense of right and wrong,” he said.
 Following a boom in deep lear­ning technologies like ChatGPT in China, Wu began researching ways to resurrect him.
 He gathered photos, videos and audio recordings of his son and spent thousands of dollars hiring AI firms that cloned Xuanmo’s face and voice.
 The results so far are rudimentary, but he has also set up a work team to create a database contai­ning vast amounts of information on his son.
 Wu hopes to feed it into powerful algorithms to create an avatar capable of copying his son’s thin­king and speech patterns with extreme precision.
 Several companies specialising in so-called “ghost bots” have emerged in the United States in recent years.
 But the industry is booming in China, according to Zhang Zewei, the founder of AI firm Super Brain and a former collaborator with Wu.
 “On AI technology, China is in the highest class worldwide,” said Zhang from a workspace in the eastern city of Jingjiang.
 “And there are so many people in China, many with emotional needs, which gives us an advantage when it comes to market demand.”
 Super Brain charges between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan (RM6,570 and RM13,140) to create a basic avatar within about 20 days, said Zhang.
 They range from those who have died to living parents unable to spend time with their children and – controversially – a heartbroken woman’s ex-boyfriend.
 Clients can even hold video calls with a staff member whose face and voice are digitally overlaid with those of the person they have lost.
 “The significance for the whole world is huge,” Zhang said.
 “A digital version of someone (can) exist forever, even after their body has been lost.”
 New humanism
 Sima Huapeng, who founded Nanjing-based Silicon Intelli­gence, said the technology would “bring about a new kind of humanism”.
 He likened it to portraiture and photography, which helped people commemorate the dead in revolutionary ways.
 Tal Morse, a visiting research fellow at the Centre for Death and Society at Britain’s University of Bath, said ghost bots may offer comfort.
 But he cautioned that more research was needed to understand their psychological and ethical implications.
 “A key question here is how ‘loyal’ are the ghost bots to the personality they were designed to mimic,” Morse told AFP.
 “What happens if they do things that will ‘contaminate’ the memory of the person they are supposed to represent?”
 Another quandary arises from the inability of dead people to consent, experts said.
 While permission was probably unnecessary to mimic speech or behaviour, it might be needed to “do certain other things with that simulacrum”, said Nate Sharadin, a philosopher at the University of Hong Kong specialising in AI and its social effects.
 For Zhang, all new technology is “a double-edged sword”.
 “As long as we’re helping those who need it, I see no problem”.
 He doesn’t work with those for whom it could have negative impacts, he said, citing a woman who had attempted suicide after her daughter’s death.
 Bereaved father Wu said Xuanmo “probably would have been willing” to be digitally revived.
 “One day, son, we will all reunite in the metaverse,” he said as his wife dissolved into tears before his grave.

628008,Main,28,16/12/2023,Pope calls for AI regulation,"Use in warfare, lack of human values among Vatican’s concerns","ROME: Pope Francis called for an international treaty to ensure artificial intelligence is developed and used ethically, arguing that the risks of technology lacking human values of compassion, mercy, morality and forgiveness are too great.
 Francis added his voice to increasing calls for binding, global regulation of AI in his annual message for the World Day of Peace, which the Catholic Church celebrates each Jan 1. The Vatican released the text of the message on Thursday.
 For Francis, the appeal is somewhat personal: Earlier this year, an AI-generated image of him wearing a luxury white puffer jacket went viral, showing just how quickly realistic deepfake imagery can spread online.
 The pope’s message was released just days after European Union negotiators secured provisional approval on the world’s first comprehensive AI rules that are expected to serve as a gold standard for governments considering their own regulation.
 Francis acknowledged the pro­mise AI offers and praised technological advances as a manifestation of the creativity of human intelligence, echoing the message the Vatican delivered at this year’s UN General Assembly where a host of world leaders raised the promise and perils of the technology.
 But his new peace message went further and emphasised the grave, existential concerns that have been raised by ethicists and human rights advocates about the technology that promises to transform everyday life in ways that can disrupt everything from democratic elections to art.
 “Artificial intelligence may well represent the highest-stakes gamble of our future,” said Cardinal Michael Czerny of the Vatican’s development office, who introduced the message at a press conference Thursday.
 “If it turns out badly, humanity is to blame.”
 The document insisted that the technological development and deployment of AI must keep foremost concerns about guaranteeing fundamental human rights, promoting peace and guarding against disinformation, discrimination and distortion.
 Francis’ greatest alarm was devoted to the use of AI in the armaments sector.
 He noted that remote weapons systems had already led to a “distancing from the immense tragedy of war”.
 “The unique capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-­making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine,” he wrote.
 On a more basic level, he warned about the profound repercussions on humanity of automated systems that rank citizens or categorise them.
 In addition to the threats to jobs around the world that can be done by robots, Francis noted that such technology could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.
 “Algorithms must not be allowed to determine how we understand human rights, to set aside the essential human values of compassion, mercy and forgiveness, or to eliminate the possibility of an individual changing and leaving his or her past behind,” he wrote. — AP",rome pope francis international treaty artificial intelligence risk technology human value compassion morality forgiveness francis voice call global regulation annual message day peace catholic church jan vatican text message thursday francis appeal personal image luxury white puffer jacket viral realistic deepfake imagery spread pope message day european union negotiator provisional approval comprehensive rule gold standard government regulation pro mise offer technological advance manifestation creativity human intelligence message vatican host leader promise peril technology peace message grave existential concern ethicist human right technology promise everyday life democratic election artificial intelligence represent stake gamble future cardinal michael vatican development office message press conference thursday humanity blame document technological development deployment concern fundamental human right peace disinformation discrimination distortion francis alarm armament sector weapon system immense tragedy war unique capacity moral judgment ethical decision complex collection algorithm capacity machine basic level profound repercussion humanity system rank citizen addition threat job robot technology determine reliability applicant mortgage migrant receive political asylum chance crime algorithm determine understand human right essential human value compassion mercy forgiveness possibility individual,"[(2, 0.9946861)]",2
628138,StarBiz 7,10,16/12/2023,AI adoption to leap forward,,"THE increasing penetration of artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the megatrends taking the world by storm. 
 From education to businesses, politics and healthcare, AI is changing our world and shaping the future of humanity across nearly every industry.
 This proliferation of this technology is expected to intensify in 2024 and beyond as businesses seek to further improve productivity and efficiency, and reduce costs, while improving the quality of life.
 According to UBS, the increasing adoption of AI is set to create significant broader implications in the global economy, particularly for a growth region like Asia.
 “AI will take technology disruption to the next level – presenting both significant opportunities and risks,” it says.
 It predicts the next 10 years or so would be defined by “AI economy”, which will have a huge impact on jobs, productivity, inflation and geopolitics, while accelerating the shift towards new economy sectors.
 Meanwhile, BlackRock predicts enterprise AI adoption and product integration will leap forward from 2024, and multi-modal AI will move closer to reality. 
 With that, hardware opportunities will grow to expand beyond graphics processing units (GPUs), the investment group says.
 Undoubtedly, the rise of AI is expected to result in further gains for advanced computing players in the future.
 Malaysia stands to gain from this development as it is exposed to the semiconductor supply chain.
 According to BNP Paribas Asset Management, there will likely be stronger deployments of GPUs, field programmable gate arrays and application specific integrated circuits, moving forward.
 “AI will likely be a major driver of semiconductor demand for the remainder of the decade, and logic and memory chip companies, foundries and semiconductor capital equipment and materials providers should benefit,” BNP Paribas says in its Investment Outlook for 2024 note.
 It points out that as AI continues to proliferate into new applications, it expects 2024 to be a crucial year in the development of the investment opportunity that AI offers.
 “We are optimistic about the pervasive adoption of AI and its positive impact on cloud service providers, software companies, owners of large databases, the semiconductor supply chain and companies that are using AI to improve business processes,” BNP Paribas says.
 “We see AI as a key enabler of recommendation engines, automated customer service systems, manufacturing automation, document production and many other systems.

627557,StarBiz,11,15/12/2023,Adobe says AI will take longer to boost results,,"NEW YORK: Adobe Inc gave a lukewarm outlook for sales in 2024, disappointing investors who expected new generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools would boost the software company’s results.
 Revenue will be about US$21.4bil in the fiscal year ending in December 2024, the company said Wednesday in a statement. 
 Profit, excluding some items, will be as much as US$18 a share. Analysts, on average, estimated sales of US$21.7bil and adjusted profit of US$18 a share.
 Wall Street expects Adobe to be one of the first software giants to benefit from the excitement over generative AI technology, which responds to prompts by producing unique text or images. 
 In recent months, the company has announced a new version of its AI model, Firefly, raised prices, and focused its October user conference on the technology. 
 The company cited “significant upsell of our new Firefly” with large customers, according to remarks prepared for a conference call after the results.
 However, that enthusiasm was dashed by the annual outlook. Shares declined about 6% in extended trading after closing at US$624.26 in New York.

627219,Main,14,14/12/2023,AI deciphering devotees’ fortunes in Taiwan,,"A TEMPLE in Taiwan’s Yunlin county is using artificial intelligence (AI) to help decipher devotees’ fortunes due to a manpower shortage, reported Sin Chew Daily. 
 The Beigang Wude temple bought three computers containing an RTX-A6000-48G graphics card, each costing T$180,000 (RM26,800), to perform the task. 
 Rather than going to the temple to seek divine answers through lottery sticks inscribed with text or numerals, people can now have their fortunes told via the temple’s Facebook page. 
 The AI is reportedly trained to decipher fortune based on the lottery stick a devotee ends up getting.
 A temple representative said that with an increasing number of visitors over the years, it unfortunately was unable to retain the staff trained to do the job.
 The temple management then started to employ AI to help ease the workload. 
 One of the most popular in Taiwan, the temple is said to receive some 200,000 visitors a day during the Chinese New Year period.
 > A man in China’s Henan province donated most of his 86.62 million yuan (RM56.5mil) lottery winnings, saying that he could not spend it all, Sin Chew Daily reported.
 According to local reports, a man wearing a mask arrived to collect his winnings but donated 53 million yuan (RM34.6mil) – 61% of his winnings – to the Henan Sports Development Foundation.
 The man surnamed Guo said he bought the ticket at a roadside stall for 100 yuan (RM65).
 Asked if he would retire from his job, Guo said: “Still have to work. Must work!”
 He said he will spend the rest of his fortune to buy a shop and a house.

 Xiao Zhao, who was adopted from an orphanage and grew up in a loving family, immediately explained that she was there to see how her biological parents were doing.
 The father curtly said: “I know we owe you a lot. I have told them (your mother and sister).”
 Xiao Zhao immediately burst into tears, adding that “no one owes anyone anything”.

625591,StarBiz,1,12/12/2023,Boom time for Malaysian AI,Local investors have not fully digested the strong upside prospects of the sector,"PETALING JAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to be the next growth engine for the technology sector.
 Stocks linked to this sub-segment of the tech space have seen strong gains this year.
 Analysts believe the run has further legs to go with companies such as Nvidia Corp, Advanced Micro Devices and their related branded manufacturers in Taiwan such as Asustek Computer Inc gaining strong interest of late. 
 AI requires computing power that is used by graphics processing unit (GPU) in computers and they are the key to the training of neural networks, the enabler of AI.
 Apart from powering computer games and graphics/video-intensive computers, GPUs help quicken the training of neural networks which are a key component of many algorithms enabling AI.
 The two main GPU designers and makers in the world are Nvidia and AMD.
 It appears that tech stocks on Bursa Malaysia have not caught up with the strong rally in the United States as the surge in interest since late last year are limited to makers of GPUs and their related companies.
 There was much buzz last week on the local tech space with Nvidia founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang dropping by several countries in the region including Malaysia to announce business ventures.
 For Malaysia, Nvidia last Friday announced a data centre partnership and it also announced last Sunday it will set up a manufacturing base in Vietnam.
 YTL Power International Bhd announced a collaboration with Nvidia to deploy AI infrastructure with Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs at its YTL Green Data Centre Park in Kulai, Johor.
 YTL Power’s share price received a boost with this development and saw gains of almost 15% last week alone. The company is now considered an AI-linked firm by market players with this partnership.
 SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the surge in share prices of AI-linked companies is just the beginning and investors have not fully digested the strong upside prospects of this latest development in the tech space.
 “We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg on a decade-long transition to AI. 
 “Right now, most of the focus is on the companies making the tools necessary to power the AI revolution that appears to be fast descending upon businesses and, eventually, the broader economy,” Innes told StarBiz.“In the immediate sense, such a build phase may also benefit the ‘shovel providers’ of this ‘gold rush’ – the companies that provide the computing power and tools necessary to build the models needed to compete. 
 “For this year, at least, Nvidia has stood out as that hardware store on the prospecting hill,” he added.
 Innes expects Nvidia will continue to trend higher and be trading at US$600 per share next year and over US$1000 in the longer term. 
 High-net-worth investor and former  investment banker Ian Yoong Kah Yin said investor interest in the domestic tech sector will be AI-driven, moving forward. 
 “The listed companies in this space are YTL Power, ITMAX System Bhd and Straits Energy Resources Bhd. YTL Corp and YTL Power, its subsidiary, are in data centres. 
 “ITMAX is in video surveillance and analytics. Straits Energy is into oil bunkering, telecommunications solutions and AI-enabling services,” Yoong told StarBiz.YTL, YTL Power, ITMAX and Straits Energy are trading at financial year 2024 price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of 10, 8, 19 and 10 times, respectively, he noted. 
 Meanwhile, Yoong said the wider local tech space on Bursa Malaysia is expected to remain in the doldrums in the first half of 2024, with recovery seen earliest in the second half of next year. 
 “The Bursa Malaysia Technology index currently commands an above-average valuation, with a forward PER multiples of 25 times. The historical average PER is 21 times.
 “The semiconductor-based sub-sector is expected to report weak earnings in the next two to three quarters,” Yoong added.
 Commenting on tech stocks’ performance on Bursa Malaysia, Rakuten Trade head of equity sales Vincent Lau said many Malaysian tech stocks appear to be stuck in a trading range.
 “Fund managers are staying on the sidelines and I think they need to see fourth-quarter numbers first. 
 “Ours are lagging behind and only in the United States it seems to be doing well. Even in Hong Kong the tech sector is struggling,” Lau told StarBiz.However, a tech recovery is still on track and the fourth quarter might be supported by restocking activities.
 He said how strong will the recovery be is still the main question.
 “But in the AI space, it still has some legs to run while for electric vehicles, it continues to be another growth sector,” Lau said.
 “We may be at a short-term bottom now, as I think it will be quite a firm recovery moving into 2024. We may be at an inflection point.”
 On YTL Power-Nvidia partnership, RHB Research said it has a long-term positive view on this development. 
 “The project may also boost its data centre take-up rate in Johor.
 “YTL Power’s earnings growth should strengthen upon the successful delivery of the project delivery in the long run but investors ought to take note that additional capital expenditure requirements ahead could be rather intensive,” it said in a note.",jaya artificial intelligence growth engine technology sector stock segment tech space strong gain analyst company corp micro device manufacturer asustek computer strong late power graphic unit gpu computer key neural network computer game video intensive computer quicken training neural network key component algorithm main gpu designer maker amd tech stock malaysia strong united surge maker gpus company week local tech space nvidia founder chief executive officer jensen country region malaysia business venture data centre partnership sunday manufacturing base vietnam ytl power international bhd collaboration deploy infrastructure nvidia tensor core gpus ytl green data centre park kulai johor ytl power share price boost development gain week company firm market player partnership spi asset management partner stephen innes surge share price company investor strong upside prospect development tech space iceberg decade transition focus company power revolution descending business broader economy innes starbiz sense phase benefit shovel provider rush company power tool model stood hardware store prospecting hill innes nvidia trend trading share term net worth investor investment banker ian kah yin investor domestic tech sector company space power itmax system bhd energy resource corp ytl power subsidiary data centre video surveillance analytics energy oil telecommunication solution service starbiz ytl ytl power itmax energy trading financial price earnings ratio time local tech space bursa malaysia doldrums half recovery earliest half bursa malaysia technology average valuation forward time historical average time semiconductor sector report weak earnings quarter tech stock performance bursa malaysia trade head equity sale vincent lau malaysian tech stock range fund manager sideline fourth quarter united hong kong tech sector lau starbiz tech recovery track fourth quarter activity strong recovery main question space leg electric vehicle growth sector short term bottom firm recovery inflection ytl power partnership rhb term positive view development project boost data centre rate johor power earnings growth successful delivery project delivery investor additional capital expenditure requirement intensive note,"[(0, 0.32106635), (3, 0.42165542), (5, 0.25527748)]",3
625631,StarBiz,5,12/12/2023,Bosses get reality                check on generation AI,,"IT is like a new relationship – the first year was starry-eyed and full of promise.
 Generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) was going to do your board presentations, write this newspaper column, delight customers and let every lay worker code away his own work problems.
 But past a year of flirting and learning, bosses are discovering the extravagance and shortcomings – both the technology’s and theirs – in bringing home the hottest tech debutant since the Internet four decades ago.
 Despite leading the region in government planning, findings are that just over one in 10 businesses in Singapore are ready.
 Cisco’s inaugural AI Readiness Index compiled around September reported only 13% of firms here are prepared to deploy and leverage AI in general.“Considerable gaps exist across other key business pillars like infrastructure, data, governance, talent and culture,” said its president for Asean Tay Bee Kheng.
 With ease of use arising from its response to common language commands, research firm Forrester expects gen AI to raise workers’ productivity by 50%, boosting them in areas such as self-service analytics, code writing and content creation.
 But will it transform businesses? For only 30% of firms in the Asia-Pacific, said the firm’s senior research director Frederic Giron.
 Even then, that will take place over years, not months, he added.
 That gen AI is the biggest thing after the Internet is beyond dispute.
 Bloomberg Intelligence projects the gen AI market to grow from US$40bil 2022 to US$1.3 trillion by 2032.
 Its share of total information technology spending on hardware, software services, ad spending and gaming market spending will boom from less than 1% to 10% over the same period, the report noted.
 Yet to get bosses to fully commit? That is going to take time.
 Bensen Koh, consultant with tech advisory firm Access Partnership, expects firms to focus on areas with the “widest potential appeal, lowest perceived risk, and lowest need for human resources upskilling”.
 For example, it could be used to help manage customer relationships and sales, accounting and finance, and for internal collaboration.
 “These are functions that most companies have and would like to improve on,” he said. 
 “As they are internal facing, risk is perceived to be lower. So long as the AI tools are relatively simple to use, not much upskilling is required.”
 Gavin Barfield, Salesforce’s chief technology officer for solutions in the region, said: “As  many Asean organisations still have untapped data, it is projected that more companies will lay the groundwork for AI by 2024.”
 Clear policies
 Just getting companies AI-ready requires data governance frameworks, clear policies for data collection, storage and use, and constant monitoring and auditing of training data, he added.
 For most back-office workers in human resources, finance and supply chain work, much more needs to happen before gen AI could support real-time analytics, flagging bottlenecks and inventory shortages.
 Enosix, an integration provider for enterprise software giant SAP, blogged: Resources are stretched, data silos are killing productivity (and the customer experience), and AI is stuck in the starting gates without trusted data.
 “But those aren’t SAP trends, that’s the state of the industry.”
 When ChatGPT went mainstream in November 2022, it immediately seduced leaders’ imagination.
 Announcements followed almost daily from businesses on new gen AI capabilities for customers and employees. 
 Some were embellished. Most were not meaningful.
 Then, bosses became alarmed when they found workers privately engaging ChatGPT and handing over company secrets like source code.
 Bot workers
 They also began to realise the business risks of employing these bot workers that not only make things up, but also spew racist, sexist and other eyebrow-raising remarks.
 At its 2024 tech trends presentation on Dec 5, Forrester senior analyst Liu Meng offered a teaser to his audience, predicting that in the coming year, “at least one insurer will offer an AI hallucination-risks policy. And it will be profitable”.
 After July, when enterprise gen AI-embedded software such as Salesforce’s Einstein GPT, Adobe’s Firefly and Microsoft’s Copilot made pricing plans public, another concern arose: costs.
 The risks and staggering investment sums ploughed into their partners, such as OpenAI and Cohere, that are building and running the large language models underlying the technology have been cited.
 The joke about town is that these costs are about to give bosses another shock treatment, not unlike the one they got not long ago from cloud subscription charges.
 Microsoft Copilot, for instance, sets a firm back US$30 per user per month.
 But to even be able to use it, the worker must already be on the E3 or E5 versions of Microsoft 365, priced at US$36 and US$57 respectively, per user per month.
 Commitment must be for at least a year.
 So what shall one do if technology gets overtaken six months from now? And after shelling out for the technology, will workers put it to good use?
 Forrester’s Giron suggests that firms start with pilots.
 “There are ways for you to test and try with gen AI pilots which are low risk and low cost to go. And then you can double down,” he said.
 “These things (like Copilot) are now going to become massively commoditised, embedded in software applications, which means that the case for justifying US$30 per user per month drops,” he added. — The Straits Times/ANN

625947,Main,8,12/12/2023,The danger of AI-powered scams,"Deepfakes, voice cloning and phishing emails on the rise, warns CSM","PETALING JAYA: Scammers are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to make their scams more believable and effective, says CyberSecurity Malaysia (CSM).
 Its chief executive officer Datuk Dr Amirudin Abdul Wahab said AI-powered scams are getting smarter by the day, making them harder to spot.
 He said it is crucial to stay updated on the latest scam tactics and take the necessary safeguards.
 Some common AI-driven scam techniques include deepfakes, voice cloning, phishing emails and text messages as well as social media manipulation, said Amirudin.
 “Deepfakes are videos or audio recordings that have been mani­pulated to make it look or sound like someone else is saying or doing something they never did.
 “Scammers can use deepfakes to impersonate trusted indivi­duals, such as a friend or family member, in order to trick victims into giving them money or personal information.
 “Voice cloning is a technique that allows scammers to create a synthetic voice that sounds exactly like someone else’s voice.
 “Scammers can then use this voice to make phone calls to victims, pretending to be someone they trust. AI could be used to generate emails that appear to be from a victim’s bank or credit card company, asking them to verify their account information,” he told The Star.
 Social media manipulation is another common technique, whereby scammers use AI to target specific individuals or groups on social media with personalised ads or messages.
 For example, an AI could be used to identify people who are recently divorced or unemployed, and then target them with ads for scams that promise to help them get rich quickly, he said.
 The Star on Dec 6 published an interview with Federal Com­mercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Comm Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf who warned how deepfakes, voice spoofing and financial market manipulation could all become the future of crime when syndicates start using AI in their operations.
 Comm Ramli had said AI could be used by syndicates in their illicit activities against Malaysians by as early as the middle of 2024.
 Meanwhile, Amirudin said the best defence against scams is vigilance and education.
 He said the public must remain cautious and sceptical of any suspicious communications. 
 “If an offer seems too good to be true, it warrants a closer look and further questioning,” he said.
 He added that when contacted by any individual or organisation, it is crucial to verify their identity first.
 “This could involve independently verifying contact details and directly reaching out to the organisation for confirmation. For example, if you receive a call from the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) claiming that you have unpaid taxes, you should contact the LHDN directly to confirm the claim,” he said.
 Amirudin said when it comes to AI-generated communications, watch for red flags such as unusual phrasing, inconsistencies in tone or factual inaccuracies.
 “With deepfakes, be alert for anomalies in voice tones or facial geometry, such as odd lighting or pixelation in video images.
 “Above all, never divulge personal or financial information to unverified parties.
 “Stay informed about potential scams by following verified news and updates from trusted ­sources, including law enforcement agencies,” he said.
 Amirudin added that CSM is aware of the potential for AI technologies like deepfakes to spread misinformation and the effectiveness of AI phishing, or malicious Generative Pre-trained Trans­formers (GPT), of gathering dangerous information.
 Generative AI could potentially be used to disseminate false information, create deceptions and modify malicious code to evade cyber defences, said Amirudin.
 “The consequences of these actions could be dire, leading to national instability, damage to digital infrastructure and breaches of sensitive data,” he said.
 On the other hand, the cyber­security industry has been leveraging AI to combat these crimes and overcome several challenges, he said.
 He added that AI provides the opportunity to enhance existing standards by using such tools to monitor, identify and counter AI threats and attacks.
 “As such, AI functions as a double-edged sword, bringing benefits to both cybersecurity efforts and potential criminals alike,” he said.Amirudin also said CSM is proactively monitoring and investigating fraudulent activities facilitated by AI technologies.
 “We collaborate with technology experts to remain at the forefront of AI developments and employ advanced detection tools to identify potential threats.
 “Furthermore, we maintain close cooperation with other agencies, both domestically and internationally, to combat these crimes effectively,” he said.
 Amirudin added that education and awareness campaigns have been a crucial component of CSM’s efforts to inform the public about the risks associated with AI-powered scams.
 It has also been collaborating with other organisations to raise awareness about the risks of AI-powered technologies and deepfakes, he said.
 Programmes such as Jelajah Anti-Scam Kebangsaan 2023, CyberSAFE Program (Cyber Security Awareness For Everyone) and the Cyber Security Awareness Talk (CSAT) have been launched to combat various AI-focused crimes, said Amirudin.",jaya scammer artificial intelligence scam believable effective cybersecurity malaysia csm chief executive officer datuk amirudin abdul wahab scam smarter day spot crucial stay scam tactic safeguard common driven scam technique deepfakes email text message social medium manipulation amirudin deepfakes audio recording sound scammer impersonate indivi duals family trick victim money personal voice technique scammer synthetic voice sound voice scammer phone call victim trust generate email bank credit card company verify account star social medium manipulation common technique scammer target specific individual social medium ad message identify people unemployed target ad rich star dec interview federal mercial crime investigation department ccid director comm datuk seri ramli deepfakes voice financial market manipulation future crime operation ramli illicit activity malaysian amirudin defence scam vigilance education public cautious sceptical suspicious communication true warrant individual organisation crucial verify identity contact detail organisation confirmation call inland revenue board unpaid tax contact claim amirudin communication red flag unusual phrasing inconsistency factual inaccuracy alert anomaly voice tone facial geometry odd pixelation video image personal financial unverified party potential scam news update source law enforcement agency csm aware potential technology spread misinformation effectiveness malicious generative pre trans former dangerous generative disseminate false create deception malicious code cyber defence amirudin consequence action leading national instability damage digital infrastructure breach sensitive data hand security industry combat crime challenge opportunity enhance standard tool identify counter threat function sword benefit cybersecurity effort potential criminal csm fraudulent activity technology technology expert forefront development advanced detection tool potential threat close cooperation agency combat crime amirudin education awareness campaign crucial component csm effort public risk scam organisation awareness risk powered technology programme jelajah anti scam kebangsaan cybersafe program cyber security awareness security awareness talk csat combat crime,"[(0, 0.16918594), (2, 0.8281354)]",2
625075,StarBiz,12,11/12/2023,Regulators look into Microsoft’s OpenAI stake,Software giant claims it doesn’t control AI company,"Washington: With global regulators examining Microsoft Corp’s US$13bil investment in OpenAI, the software giant has a simple argument it hopes will resonate with antitrust officials: It doesn’t own a traditional stake in the buzzy startup so can’t be said to control it.
 When Microsoft negotiated an additional US$10bil investment in OpenAI in January, it opted for an unusual arrangement, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Rather than buy a chunk of the cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) lab, it cut a deal to receive almost half of OpenAI’s financial returns until the investment is repaid up to a pre-determined cap, one of the people said. The unorthodox structure was concocted because OpenAI is a capped for-profit company housed inside a non-profit organisation.
 It’s not clear regulators see a distinction, however. Last Friday the British Competition and Markets Authority said it was gathering information from stakeholders to determine whether the collaboration between the two firms threatens competition in Britain, home of Google’s AI research lab Deepmind. 
 The US Federal Trade Commission is also examining the nature of Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and whether it may violate antitrust laws, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 The inquiries are preliminary and the agency hasn’t opened a formal investigation, according to the person, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. 
 Microsoft didn’t report the transaction to the agency because the investment in OpenAI doesn’t amount to control of the company under US law, the person said. OpenAI is a non-profit and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren’t reported under US merger law, regardless of value. Agency officials are analysing the situation and assessing what its options are.
 “While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to a share of profit distributions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. 
 last Friday, Microsoft president Brad Smith said “the only thing that has changed is that Microsoft will now have a non-voting observer on OpenAI’s board.” He described its relationship with OpenAI as “very different” from Google’s outright acquisition of DeepMind in Britain.
 “Our partnership with Microsoft empowers us to pursue our research and develop safe and beneficial AI tools for everyone, while remaining independent and operating competitively. Their non-voting board observer does not provide them with governing authority or control over OpenAI’s operations,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in a statement.
 From the beginning, Microsoft and OpenAI took pains to telegraph the two companies’ independence. Microsoft hoped to reassure investors and customers that it’s not overly reliant on one partner. OpenAI didn’t want employees, customers and other investors thinking it was merely an outpost of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. That careful positioning was upended last month with the firing of OpenAI chief executive officer (CEO) Sam Altman and the startup’s near implosion. 
 The Altman imbroglio demonstrated both Microsoft’s lack of control and its influence. Microsoft received just minutes notice that the OpenAI board planned to announce Altman’s ouster, and its executives were not consulted in the decision. Still Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella played a key role, along with other investors, in forcing the board to reverse its decision. At one point Microsoft said it would hire Altman and his OpenAI colleagues to form a new Microsoft AI unit.
 Once Altman was restored as CEO, Microsoft executives debated the wisdom of taking a seat on the OpenAI board, people familiar with the matter said at the time. On the one hand, executives feared that a board seat or observer slot might draw the attention of regulators. 
 On the other hand, Microsoft wanted to keep a closer eye on its partner and protect its investment – an imperative that carried the day, despite the risks.
 Ultimately, Microsoft could face a world of regulatory headaches. Regulators in Europe are also paying attention, according to a spokesperson for the European Commission. 
 In order for a transaction to be notifiable to the Commission under the EU Merger Regulation, it has to involve a change of control on a lasting basis. While this transaction has not been formally notified, the Commission had been following the situation even before the management turmoil, the spokesperson said.
 Last month, Germany’s competition authority said it wasn’t subjecting Microsoft’s OpenAI investment to a merger review. But the regulator said they would hold off only because OpenAI didn’t have substantial business in Germany. 
 After reviewing the transaction and talking the companies, the regulator found the investment would give Microsoft a “material competitive influence” over the AI company that might warrant scrutiny in the future if OpenAI increases its activities in Germany.
 The partnership raises competition issues if Microsoft cuts back on its own AI research and development or if the investment keeps OpenAI from partnering with the tech giant’s rivals, said Bloomberg Intelligence antitrust analyst Jennifer Rie. 
 Antitrust enforcers may also have concerns about Microsoft’s board observer since it would give Microsoft additional information on OpenAI’s plans even if it doesn’t have rights to influence the decisions. — Bloomberg",washington global regulator microsoft corp bil investment openai software giant simple argument hope antitrust official traditional stake buzzy startup control additional bil investment january unusual arrangement people familiar matter time chunk edge artificial intelligence lab cut deal receive half openai financial return investment pre cap people unorthodox structure openai capped profit company inside profit organisation regulator friday british competition market stakeholder determine collaboration firm competition britain google lab deepmind federal trade commission nature microsoft investment openai violate antitrust law person familiar matter inquiry preliminary agency formal investigation person confidential matter microsoft report transaction agency investment openai amount control company law person openai profit acquisition corporate entity merger law agency official situation option detail agreement confidential note microsoft portion openai share profit distribution spokesperson statement friday microsoft president brad smith microsoft voting observer board relationship google outright acquisition deepmind britain partnership microsoft empowers safe beneficial tool independent board observer authority control openai operation spokesperson statement microsoft openai pain telegraph company microsoft reassure investor customer reliant partner employee customer investor outpost redmond washington careful positioning upended month openai chief executive officer ceo sam altman startup implosion altman imbroglio microsoft lack control influence minute board ouster executive decision ceo satya nadella key role investor board reverse decision microsoft hire altman colleague microsoft unit altman ceo microsoft executive wisdom seat board people familiar matter time hand executive board seat slot draw attention regulator hand eye partner protect investment imperative day risk microsoft regulatory headache regulator attention spokesperson european commission transaction notifiable commission merger regulation change control lasting basis transaction notified commission situation management turmoil spokesperson month germany competition authority microsoft openai investment merger review regulator openai substantial business germany transaction company regulator investment microsoft material competitive influence company warrant scrutiny future openai increase activity partnership competition issue cut development investment openai tech giant rival intelligence antitrust analyst jennifer rie antitrust enforcer concern board observer additional openai plan right influence decision,"[(2, 0.6060737), (3, 0.39151028)]",2
625289,Lifestyle,4,11/12/2023,Inside the Pentagon’s AI battlefield,The US military’s advancements raise questions about the role of autonomous lethal weapons and the challenges of responsible artificial intelligence deployment.,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) employed by the US military has piloted pint-sized surveillance drones in special operations forces’ missions and helped Ukraine in its war against Russia.
 It tracks soldiers’ fitness, predicts when Air Force planes need maintenance, and helps keep tabs on rivals in space.
 Now, the Pentagon is intent on fielding multiple thousands of relatively inexpensive, expendable AI-enabled autonomous vehicles by 2026 to keep pace with China.
 The ambitious initiative, dubbed Replicator, seeks to “galvanise progress in the too-slow shift of US military innovation to leverage platforms that are small, smart, cheap, and many”, deputy secretary of defence Kathleen Hicks said in August.
 While its funding is uncertain and details vague, Replicator is expected to accelerate hard decisions on what AI tech is mature and trustworthy enough to deploy, including weaponised systems.There is little dispute among scientists, industry experts and Pentagon officials that the United States will, within the next few years, have fully autonomous lethal weapons.
 And though officials insist humans will always be in control, experts say advances in data- processing speed and machine-to-machine communications will inevitably relegate people to supervisory roles.
 That’s especially true if, as expected, lethal weapons are deployed en masse in drone swarms.
 Many countries are working on them, and neither China, Russia, Iran, India, nor Pakistan have signed a US-initiated pledge to use military AI responsibly.
 It’s unclear if the Pentagon is currently formally assessing any fully autonomous lethal weapons system for deployment, as required by a 2012 directive. A Pentagon spokeswoman would not say.
 Replicator highlights immense technological and personnel challenges for Pentagon procurement and development as the AI revolution promises to transform how wars are fought.
 “The Department of Defense is struggling to adopt the AI developments from the last machine- learning breakthrough,” said Gregory Allen, a former top Pentagon AI official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
 The Pentagon’s portfolio boasts more than 800 AI-related unclassified projects, much of which is still in testing. Typically, machine learning and neural networks are helping humans gain insights and create efficiencies.
 “The AI that we’ve got in the Department of Defense right now is heavily leveraged and augments people,” said Missy Cummings, director of George Mason University’s robotics centre and a former Navy fighter pilot.
 “There’s no AI running around on its own. People are using it to try to understand the fog of war better.”
 One domain where AI-assisted tools are tracking potential threats is space, the latest frontier in military competition.
 China envisions using AI, including on satellites, to “make decisions on who is and isn’t an adversary”, US Space Force chief technology and innovation officer Lisa Costa told an online conference recently.The US aims to keep pace.
 An operational prototype called Machina used by the Space Force keeps tabs autonomously on more than 40,000 objects in space, orchestrating thousands of data collections nightly with a global telescope network.
 Machina’s algorithms marshal telescope sensors. Computer vision and large language models tell them what objects to track. And AI choreographs drawing instantly on astrodynamics and physics datasets, Col Wallace ‘Rhet’ Turnbull of Space Systems Command told a conference in August.
 Another AI project at the Space Force analyses radar data to detect imminent adversary missile launches, he said.
 Elsewhere, AI’s predictive powers help the Air Force keep its fleet aloft, anticipating the maintenance needs of more than 2,600 aircraft, including B-1 bombers and Blackhawk helicopters.
 Machine-learning models identify possible failures dozens of hours before they happen, said Tom Siebel, CEO of Silicon Valley-based C3 AI, which has the contract.
 C3’s tech also models the trajectories of missiles for the US Missile Defense Agency and identifies insider threats in the federal workforce for the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.Among health-related efforts is a pilot project tracking the fitness of the Army’s entire Third Infantry Division – more than 13,000 soldiers. Predictive modelling and AI help reduce injuries and increase performance, said Maj Matt Visser.
 In Ukraine, AI provided by the Pentagon and its Nato allies helps thwart Russian aggression.
 Nato allies share intelligence from data gathered by satellites, drones and humans, some aggregated with software from US contractor Palantir.
 Some data comes from Maven, the Pentagon’s pathfinding AI project now mostly managed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, say officials, including retired Air Force Gen Jack Shanahan, the inaugural Pentagon AI director. 
 Maven began in 2017 as an effort to process video from drones in the Middle East – spurred by US Special Operations forces fighting ISIS and al-Qaeda – and now aggregates and analyses a wide array of sensors and human-derived data.
 AI has also helped the US-  created Security Assistance Group for Ukraine organise logistics for military assistance from a coalition of 40 countries, Pentagon officials say.To survive on the battlefield these days, military units must be small, mostly invisible and move quickly because exponentially growing networks of sensors let anyone “see anywhere on the globe at any moment”, then-joint chiefs chairman Gen Mark Milley observed in a June speech. “And what you can see, you can shoot.”
 To more quickly connect combatants, the Pentagon has prioritised the development of intertwined battle networks, called Joint All-Domain Command and Control, to automate the processing of optical, infrared, radar and other data across the armed services.
 But the challenge is huge and fraught with bureaucracy.
 Christian Brose, a former Senate Armed Services Committee staff director now at the defence tech firm Anduril, is among the military reform advocates who nevertheless believe they “may be winning here to a certain extent”.
 “The argument may be less about whether this is the right thing to do and increasingly more about how do we actually do it – and on the rapid timelines required,” he said. 
 Brose’s 2020 book, The Kill Chain, argues for urgent retooling to match China in the race to develop smarter and cheaper networked weapons systems.
 To that end, the US military is hard at work on “human- machine teaming”.
 Dozens of uncrewed air and sea vehicles currently keep tabs on Iranian activity. US Marines and Special Forces also use Anduril’s autonomous Ghost mini-copter, sensor towers and counter-drone tech to protect American forces.
 Industry advances in computer vision have been essential. Shield AI lets drones operate without GPS, communications or even remote pilots.
 It’s the key to its Nova, a quadcopter, which US special operations units have used in conflict areas to scout buildings.
 On the horizon: The Air Force’s “loyal wingman” programme intends to pair piloted aircraft with autonomous ones.
 An F-16 pilot might, for instance, send out drones to scout, draw enemy fire or attack targets. Air Force leaders are aiming for a debut later this decade.The loyal wingman timeline doesn’t quite mesh with Replicator’s, which many consider overly ambitious. In the meantime, the Pentagon’s vagueness on Replicator may partly intend to keep rivals guessing, though planners may also still be feeling their way on feature and mission goals, said Paul Scharre, a military AI expert and author of Four Battlegrounds.
 Anduril and Shield AI, each backed by hundreds of millions in venture capital funding, are among the companies vying for contracts.
 Nathan Michael, chief technology officer at Shield AI, estimates they will have an autonomous swarm of at least three uncrewed aircraft ready in a year using its V-BAT aerial drone. 
 The US military currently uses the V-BAT – without an AI mind – on Navy ships, on counter-drug missions and in support of Marine Expeditionary Units, the company says.It will take some time before larger swarms can be reliably fielded, Michael said. 
 “Everything is crawl, walk, run – unless you’re setting yourself up for failure.”
 The only weapons systems that Shanahan, the inaugural Pentagon AI chief, currently trusts to operate autonomously are wholly defensive, like Phalanx anti-missile systems on ships. 
 He worries less about autonomous weapons making decisions on their own than about systems that don’t work as advertised or kill non-combatants or friendly forces.
 The department’s current chief digital and AI officer, Craig Martell, is determined not to let that happen.
 “Regardless of the autonomy of the system, there will always be a responsible agent that understands the limitations of the system, has trained well with the system, has justified confidence in when and where it’s deployable, and will always take the responsibility,” said Martell, who previously headed machine- learning at LinkedIn and Lyft. “That will never not be the case.”As to when AI will be reliable enough for lethal autonomy, Martell said it makes no sense to generalise. For example, Martell trusts his car’s adaptive cruise control but not the tech that’s supposed to keep it from changing lanes.
 “As the responsible agent, I would not deploy that except in very constrained situations,” he said. “Now extrapolate that to the military.”
 Martell’s office is evaluating potential generative AI use cases – it has a special task force for that – but focuses more on testing and evaluating AI in development.
 One urgent challenge, says Jane Pinelis, chief AI engineer at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Lab and former chief of AI assurance in Martell’s office, is recruiting and retaining the talent needed to test AI tech.
 The Pentagon can’t compete on salaries. Computer science PhDs with AI-related skills can earn more than the military’s top- ranking generals and admirals.Testing and evaluation standards are also immature, as a recent National Academy of Sciences report on Air Force AI highlighted.
 Might that mean the US will one day field under duress autonomous weapons that don’t fully pass muster?
 “We are still operating under the assumption that we have time to do this as rigorously and as diligently as possible,” said Pinelis.“I think if we’re less than ready and it’s time to take action, somebody is going to be forced to make a decision.” – AP",artificial intelligence military pint surveillance drone special operation force mission ukraine war russia soldier fitness predicts air force

624691,Main,35,10/12/2023,EU strikes deal to regulate AI tools,Generative systems such as ChatGPT and Bard to come under a set of controls,"BRUSSELS: The European Union reached a hard-fought deal on what is poised to become the most comprehensive regulation of artificial intelligence in the western world. 
 Thierry Breton, the bloc’s internal market chief, said the deal strikes a balance between fostering innovation and protecting the rights of people and companies. 
 “We spent a lot of time on finding the right balance between making the most of AI potential to support law enforcement while protecting our citizens’ fundamental rights,” he said early Saturday in a statement. “We do not want any mass surveillance in Europe.”
 After more than 37 hours of negotiations this week, delegates from the European Commission, the European Parliament and 27 member countries agreed to a set of controls for generative artificial intelligence tools such as OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard – the kind capable of producing content on command.
 The negotiators agreed to allow some live scanning of faces, but with safeguards and exemptions, Breton said. The deal would prohibit biometric scanning that categorises people by sensitive characteristics, such as political or religious beliefs, sexual orientation or race. Officials said this was one of the most difficult and sensitive issues in the talks.
 The proposed legislation would impose financial penalties on companies that violate the rules, with fines up to €35 million (RM175.84mil), or 7% of global turnover, depending on the infringement and the size of the company. 
 The draft legislation still needs to be formally approved by EU member states and the parliament. But the deal marks a critical step toward landmark AI policy that will – in the absence of any meaningful action by US Congress – set the tone for the regulation of the fast-developing technology. The EU is aiming to enact the first firm guardrails on AI outside of Asia. 
 Policymakers have been working for months to finalise the language in the AI Act and get it passed before European elections in June usher in a new commission and parliament that could force more changes and stall efforts. 
 The decision was hammered out at a session on Friday following a nearly 24 hour marathon that stretched from Wednesday to Thursday. During the first meeting, some negotiators dozed off in the hall as others debated the most sensitive topic of restricting live facial scanning technology in public before finally agreeing to break.The difficult discussions underscore how contentious the debate over regulating AI has become, dividing world leaders and tech executives alike as generative tools continue explode in popularity. 
 The EU – like other governments including the US and UK – has struggled to find a balance between the need to protect its own AI startups, such as France’s Mistral AI and Germany’s Aleph Alpha, against potential societal risks. That proved to be a key sticking point in negotiations, with some countries including France and Germany opposing rules that they said would unnecessarily handicap local companies. — Bloomberg",brussels union fought deal comprehensive regulation artificial intelligence western thierry breton bloc internal market chief deal strike balance innovation right people company lot time balance potential support law enforcement citizen fundamental right saturday statement mass surveillance europe hour negotiation week delegate european commission european parliament country set control generative artificial intelligence tool chatgpt google bard capable content command negotiator live scanning safeguard exemption deal prohibit biometric scanning categorises people sensitive characteristic political religious belief sexual orientation race official difficult sensitive issue talk legislation financial penalty company rule fine mil global turnover infringement size company draft legislation parliament deal critical step landmark policy absence meaningful action congress regulation technology enact firm asia policymakers month language european election usher commission parliament force stall effort decision session hour marathon wednesday thursday meeting negotiator hall sensitive topic live facial technology public break difficult discussion contentious debate regulating leader tech executive generative tool explode popularity government balance protect startup mistral germany aleph potential societal risk key negotiation country france germany rule local company,"[(2, 0.42642274), (3, 0.5691478)]",3
624609,StarBiz 7,4,09/12/2023,YTL Power and Nvidia in AI collaboration,Deal to bring fastest supercomputers to M’sia by 2024,"PETALING JAYA: YTL Power International Bhd has joined forces with Nasdaq’s Nvidia Corp to build artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure that is expected to bring the fastest supercomputers to Malaysia by mid-2024.
 The AI infrastructure will reside at the YTL Green Data Centre Park in Johor – a 500-megawatt facility developed by YTL Power and powered entirely by on-site solar energy.
 Meanwhile, YTL Communications Sdn Bhd, the telecommunications subsidiary of YTL Power, which operates a national mobile network under the “Yes” brand, will own and manage the AI infrastructure and provide AI computing services to the nation.
 In a statement, YTL Power said the AI infrastructure will provide the foundation for scientific research and the development of solutions and applications that will accelerate Malaysia’s progress towards becoming an AI nation. 
 “YTL will not only provide green, energy-efficient AI infrastructure to scientists, developers, and startups across the nation, it will also create AI-specific applications and services for its customers,” it added.
 The group announced plans to deploy graphics processing units (GPUs), particularly the Nvidia H100 Tensor Core, which is known for its capabilities in supporting cutting-edge AI data centres. 
 Nvidia H100 GPUs deliver generative AI and can speed up large language models or LLMs by 30 times compared with the previous-generation GPUs. 
 Additionally, YTL Power will utilise Nvidia’s AI enterprise software to enhance efficiency in AI production. It plans to customise and deploy a Malay language foundation model that will be sensitive to Malaysia’s multicultural heritage.
 Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz, who witnessed the collaboration, said this partnership exemplifies the kind of strategic collaborations targeted by the New Industrial Master Plan 2030.
 “By offering supercomputing cloud services and leveraging AI to power innovations, such partnerships enhance our economic complexity, paving the way for us to become a high technology and high-income nation while further positioning Malaysia as a top investment destination,” he said.

624149,StarBiz,9,08/12/2023,Asia hedge funds avert China turmoil with bets on Japan and AI,,"SINGAPORE: Asia hedge funds are set to post improved performances in 2023 after dodging the China investment minefield with winning bets tied to Japan’s rebound, economic trends and the artificial intelligence or AI-fuelled technology rally.
 About 58% of Asia-focused funds tracked by Preqin Ltd avoided losses in the first 10 months of the year, compared with just 32% in 2022. Among the 2023 winners are funds overseen by Astignes Capital Asia Pte, Keystone Investors Pte, Panview Capital Ltd and Trivest Advisors Ltd. 
 Buoyant stock markets in November – the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index jumped the most since January – may have narrowed or eliminated losses at other funds, with a Eurekahedge Pte index edging up about 1% for the month even before most funds reported numbers.
 Funds were rewarded for navigating choppy waters in China, where the short-lived euphoria over exiting from Covid restrictions gave way to persistent concerns about a housing market crisis, economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions. 
 Those who cut China bets early in favour of Japan and global technology names reaped benefits, even as the investor stampede for Japan stymied bearish wagers.
 About 68% of China-focused hedge funds lost money in the first 10 months of the year, compared with just 18% of peers specialising in Japan, according to Preqin data.
 Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc partner Ryan Thall’s Panview Asian Equity Fund surged nearly 20% in the first 11 months, led by bullish bets on smaller, lesser-known Japanese companies swept up in corporate governance reforms, said a person with knowledge of the matter. 
 Also paying off were bets against Asian duty-free shop operators for not meeting market expectations after China lifted pandemic controls. It also profited from a short position against a US cosmetics maker that has struggled to maintain sales in China.
 Athos Asia Event Driven Fund returned 5.6% through November, said a source. Deals lifted returns, such as those involving Australia’s Origin Energy Ltd and Japanese companies. The fund made money from a bet that the market exaggerated the risk that China would refuse regulatory approval for US chipmaker Broadcom Inc’s merger with cloud company VMWare Inc. 
 Athos, an Asia event-driven shop founded by Matthew Moskey and Fred Schulte-Hillen, also profited from short-term pricing gaps among Chinese companies’ shares traded domestically, in Hong Kong and in the United States. More US-traded Chinese companies have gained listings in Hong Kong in recent years. 
 Investor exodus
 The investor exodus from Chinese equities made for greater arbitrage opportunities as stock prices became more volatile and spreads between different classes of shares widened, said the source. 
 Trivest Advisors’ TAL China Focus Master Fund averted the fate of its peers with a nearly 16% gain in the first 10 months. 
 At the end of September, the firm held more than US$830mil worth of shares of US technology giants Microsoft Corp, Meta Platforms Inc, Nvidia Corp and Alphabet Inc. It also had nearly US$193mil parked in the US shares of PDD Holdings Inc, a rising star among Chinese eCommerce companies, and Luckin Coffee Inc, the Chinese coffee chain that has staged a turnaround after fraud allegations. The two have soared 74% and 37% respectively this year. 
 Good performance
 Keystone Investors returned nearly 24% in the first 11 months, said a source. It dabbled in some of the same names, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta and PDD, along with New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc, whose US shares more than doubled this year. Keystone is led by Liu Xuan, a one-time analyst and portfolio manager at global firms including Point72 Asset Management and Millennium Management. 
 Ovata Equity Strategies Fund rose 9.7% in the first 11 months, said a person familiar with the firm helmed by James Chen, former Asia equities head of BlueCrest Capital Management. More volatile markets favour funds like Ovata that seek to profit from wider pricing disparities between related securities. The fund also made money from Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei 225 up 27% this year.
 Two Asia-focused firms that allocate capital to pods of investors with different strategies proved the benefits of diversification this year. Dymon Asia Multi-Strategy Investment Fund gained an estimated 10% in the first 11 months, while Polymer Asia Fund was up 3.4% through October, according to sources.
 Macro hedge funds
 The biggest winner as a group was macro hedge funds, which trade across stock, bond, commodity and currency markets to tap broad trends.
 Arete Macro Fund of Will Li’s Ocean Arete Ltd gained 9.1% in the first 11 months, according to a source. Lifting returns was a bullish bet on the greenback and bearish wagers on longer-dated US Treasury bonds, on the belief that the US economy would withstand higher interest rates.

624331,Main,15,08/12/2023,AI belongs to the capitalists now,,"WHAT happened at OpenAI over a few days last month could be described in many ways: a juicy boardroom drama, a tug of war over one of America’s biggest startups, a clash between those who want artificial intelligence to progress faster and those who want to slow it down.
 But it was, most importantly, a fight between two duelling visions of AI.
 In one vision, AI is a transformative new tool, the latest in a line of world-changing innovations that includes the steam engine, electricity and the personal computer, and that, if put to the right uses, could usher in a new era of prosperity and make gobs of money for the businesses that harness its potential.
 In another vision, AI is something closer to an alien life form – a leviathan being summoned from the mathematical depths of neural networks – that must be restrained and deployed with extreme caution in order to prevent it from taking over and killing us all.
 With the return of Sam Altman to OpenAI, the company whose board fired him as CEO a few days earlier, the battle between these two views appears to be over.
 Team Capitalism won. Team Leviathan lost.
 OpenAI’s new board will consist of three people, at least initially: Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora (and the only holdover from the old board); Bret Taylor, a former executive at Facebook and Salesforce; and former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The board is expected to grow from there.
 OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, is also expected to have a larger voice in OpenAI’s governance going forward. That may include a board seat.
 Gone from the board are three of the members who pushed for Altman’s ouster: Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist (who has since recanted his decision); Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and researcher at the RAND Corp.
 Sutskever, Toner and McCauley are representative of the kinds of people who were heavily involved in thinking about AI a decade ago – an eclectic mix of academics, Silicon Valley futurists and computer scientists.
 They viewed the technology with a mix of fear and awe, and they worried about theoretical future events like the “singularity,” a point at which AI would outstrip our ability to contain it.
 Many were affiliated with philosophical groups like the Effective Altruists, a movement that uses data and rationality to make moral decisions, and were persuaded to work in AI out of a desire to minimise the technology’s destructive effects.
 This was the vibe around AI in 2015, when OpenAI was formed as a non-profit, and it helps explain why the organisation kept its convoluted governance structure – which gave the non-profit board the ability to control the company’s operations and replace its leadership – even after it started a for-profit arm in 2019.
 At the time, protecting AI from the forces of capitalism was viewed by many in the industry as a top priority, one that needed to be enshrined in corporate bylaws and charter documents.
 But a lot has changed since 2019. Powerful AI is no longer just a thought experiment – it exists inside real products, like ChatGPT, that are used by millions of people every day.
 The world’s biggest tech companies are racing to build even more powerful systems. And billions of dollars are being spent to build and deploy AI inside businesses, with the hope of reducing labour costs and increasing productivity.
 The new board members are the kinds of business leaders you’d expect to oversee such a project.
 Taylor, the new board chair, is a seasoned Silicon Valley deal maker who led the sale of Twitter to Elon Musk last year, when he was the chair of Twitter’s board. And Summers is the Ur-capitalist – a prominent economist who has said that he believes technological change is “net good” for society.
 There may still be voices of caution on the reconstituted OpenAI board, or figures from the AI safety movement. But they won’t have veto power, or the ability to effectively shut down the company in an instant, the way the old board did. And their preferences will be balanced alongside others’, such as those of the company’s executives and investors.
 That’s a good thing if you’re Microsoft, or any of the thousands of other businesses that rely on OpenAI’s technology. More traditional governance means less risk of a sudden explosion, or a change that would force you to switch AI providers in a hurry.
 And perhaps what happened at OpenAI – a triumph of corporate interests over worries about the future – was inevitable, given AI’s increasing importance. A technology potentially capable of ushering in a Fourth Industrial Revolution was unlikely to be governed over the long term by those who wanted to slow it down – not when so much money was at stake.
 There are still a few traces of the old attitudes in the AI industry. Anthropic, a rival company started by a group of former OpenAI employees, has set itself up as a public benefit corporation, a legal structure that is meant to insulate it from market pressures. And an active open-source AI movement has advocated that AI remain free of corporate control.
 But these are best viewed as the last vestiges of the old era of AI, in which the people building AI regarded the technology with both wonder and terror, and sought to restrain its power through organisational governance. Now, the utopians are in the driver’s seat. Full speed ahead. — ©2023 The New York Times Company",openai day month juicy boardroom drama tug war america biggest startup clash artificial intelligence progress fight vision vision transformative tool innovation steam engine electricity personal computer era prosperity money business potential vision closer alien life form leviathan mathematical depth neural network deployed extreme caution prevent return sam altman company board ceo day battle view team capitalism team leviathan board consist people angelo ceo board bret taylor executive facebook salesforce treasury secretary larry summer board grow largest investor microsoft larger voice openai governance board seat board altman ouster ilya sutskever chief scientist decision helen toner director strategy georgetown university security technology tasha mccauley entrepreneur researcher corp sutskever toner representative kind people thinking decade eclectic mix academic valley futurist computer scientist technology mix fear awe theoretical future event singularity outstrip ability philosophical effective altruist movement data rationality moral decision desire minimise technology destructive effect openai profit organisation governance structure profit board ability control company operation leadership started profit arm time force capitalism industry top priority corporate bylaw document powerful experiment exists real product million people day biggest tech company build powerful system billion dollar build deploy business labour cost productivity board business leader oversee project taylor board chair silicon valley deal maker sale twitter elon musk chair board summer capitalist prominent economist technological change net society voice openai board figure safety movement veto power ability company instant board preference company executive investor microsoft thousand business technology traditional governance risk sudden explosion change force switch provider openai triumph corporate worry inevitable technology capable ushering fourth industrial revolution term money stake trace attitude industry anthropic rival company openai employee public benefit corporation legal structure insulate market pressure active source movement free corporate control vestige era people technology terror restrain power organisational governance utopian seat speed york time company,"[(2, 0.18360274), (4, 0.8137866)]",4
623793,StarBiz,12,07/12/2023,Outperforming Beijing tech fund calls for caution on AI stocks,,"SHANGHAI: A technology-focused China equity fund outperforming 98% of peers this year advises caution over the frenzy in artificial intelligence (AI) themes, saying it might be the biggest under-priced risk.
 “There are huge fundamental risks, especially in terms of public safety, in AI at this current stage,” said Yun Bingwang, an investment officer at Qingdao Luxiu Investment Management Co. 
 “These uncertainties mean that we cannot make investment decisions.” 
 Yun’s Luxiu Lvjing Fund has returned 76% this year, according to fund tracker Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment and Management Co, trouncing the benchmark CSI 300 Index by 88 percentage points. That puts the fund, which primarily invests in global tech companies, in the top 2% among 10,308 peer private-fund products.
 The fund owes its outperformance to bets on online retailer PDD Holdings Inc, best known for hit shopping app Temu and domestic bargains trailblazer Pinduoduo, amid the stock’s slump earlier this year. 
 The market misjudged Chinese consumers’ shift back into premium products after the end of Covid controls, said Yun. 
 Dip buying in Apple Inc shares in late 2022 also contributed to returns.
 While Yun is keeping tabs on how AI is disrupting tech giants, he said there’s no rush to buy. 
 He compares missing out on AI this year to side stepping the euphoria in Chinese private tutoring names in early 2021, with some firms losing almost all of their value later that year after a shock overhaul over the sector.
 In China, six out the top 10 performers on the benchmark gauge this year were lifted on AI wagers, with Dawning Information Industry Co’s 73% advance helming the charge.

623521,Main,5,06/12/2023,HK cops encounter fraud syndicate that used AI-generated images,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Hong Kong police crippled a fraud syndicate that used artificial intelligence (AI) to create doctored images for loan scams targeting banks and money-lenders.
 Superintendent Dicken Ko Tik of the cyber security and techno­logy crime bureau was reported saying on Aug 25 that it was the first time police had discovered scammers employing the so-called deepfake technology to deceive financial institutions.
 “The racket used an AI face- changing programme, commonly known as deepfake technology, to apply for loans online with financial institutions,” he said.
 According to police, the syndicate used eight stolen Hong Kong identity cards and bogus documents, including proof of address and income, to apply for loans online.
 As financial institutions required applicants to scan and upload their identification documents as well as provide real-time selfies during the online application process, Ko said scammers utilised AI-generated ­images to mimic people on the stolen identity cards.
 He said an investigation revea­led that the syndicate made at least 20 online loan applications using the technology in a bid to deceive facial recognition systems used by money-lenders to verify applicant identities.
 He added that one of the 20 applications that was approved involved a loan of HK$70,000 (RM42,050).
 The deepfake scam has promp­ted police to offer recommendations to related financial institutions to upgrade their anti-fraud measures.
 “We will continue to engage with stakeholders from various industries to bring cyber criminals hiding in the digital world to justice,” he was quoted by the South China Morning Post on Aug 25.
 On top of the 20 cases involving AI-generated images, police said the syndicate also used the eight stolen identity cards to apply for 70 other loans and 54 bank accounts with 20 different banks and money-lending companies between September 2022 and July this year.
 Ko said the syndicate also used the stolen identity cards to register for more than 30 prepaid SIM cards.
 In April and May, the fraudsters used the SIM cards to send out more than 7,200 phishing messa­ges, tricking residents into provi­ding credit card information by falsely offering shopping reward points, he said.
 After gathering evidence, police arrested four men and two women in a series of raids in Kowloon Bay, Diamond Hill, Yau Ma Tei, Lai Chi Kok and North Point on Aug 24.

 Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Comm Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said as part of their efforts to gear up to combat AI-based crime, it is important for his personnel to know what they are potentially up against.
 “With AI, the enemy that we are facing is invisible, which makes policing efforts more complex.
 “As such, we are sending  our officers from time to time  for training and international exposure with other law enforcement agencies across the  globe.
 “We are always looking for appropriate courses to enhance their knowledge and skills,” he told The Star recently.
 He said they are working closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on the matter.

 “We need to ensure we are one step ahead of them so that the use of AI by syndicates does not get out of hand,” he said.

 The two artificial intelligence-based machines, costing RM9.2mil, have already improved the quality of patient care services since they started operating at the varsity on Dec 26 last year (Fluoroscopy System) and Feb 8 this year (Angiography System), said UKM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Mohd Ekhwan Toriman.
 The biplace angiography and fluoroscopy machines were acquired for the Radiology Department and Endoscopy Centre, respectively, as part of the RM53mil allocation for HCTM under the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP).
 Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the allocation was to replace obsolete equipment used for radiology, operating room, endoscopy, radiotherapy and oncology services.
 HCTM, he said, is a teaching hospital that has been in operation for 26 years.
 Various amenities, facilities and equipment are in need of upgrading, replacement and refurbishment, he said.
 The quality of the medical education ecosystem and the efficiency of the services that teaching hospitals offer cannot be compromised, he said, adding that the 12MP allocation would facilitate the utilisation of cutting-edge medical equipment, and enhance the standard and quality of treatment services at HCTM.
 His speech was read out by the ministry’s deputy secretary-general (Management and Development) Dr Mohd Zabri Yusoff during the unveiling of the equipment at UKM on Oct 30.

622463,Main,28,03/12/2023,AI solutions for Asian consumers,"Govt pursues local, softer approach to artificial intelligence regulation","As countries around the world rush to create regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) in light of a surge in real-life applications, Indonesia aims for its own “local” approach.
 However, experts have raised questions about the aspiration, considering the country’s predo­minant position as an AI consumer rather than a trailblazer in the industry.
 Three years after introducing the National AI Strategy 2020-2045, the government has decided to issue an open letter to businesspeople as an initial step toward regulating AI tech.
 A four-page draft of the letter shared by officials proposes ethical guidelines to shape company-internal policies for AI programming, analysis and consulting.“The letter serves as an ethical guide that is not legally binding but rather governs at a normative level,” Deputy Communications and Information Minister Nezar Patria told the media in a press conference after an AI focus group discussion (FGD).
 The letter is to be finalised and released later this month.
 Keeping things flexible
 Despite its non-binding character, the letter was not an attempt to come up with the feeblest possible measure, Nezar said.
 Rather, he noted, given the rapid technological progress, the government had to remain open to any possible developments, which included being prepared to establish legally-binding regulations as needed.
 Nezar pointed out that Indo­nesia’s strategy diverged from that of the United States, the European Union and China, which were adept in AI technology, and would instead prioritise the local context in line with the country’s ideology. 
 “We can comply with global governance values while looking at our local values such as cooperative inclusivity, humanity, safety, democracy, transparency, credibility and accountability,” he elaborated. Indonesia has teamed up with AI Singapore to develop an open-source large language model (LLM) designed specifically for the Indonesian language and culture.
 AI must understand Indonesia
 In a panel discussion following the partnership signing ceremony in Jakarta, William Tjhi, head of applied research for foundation models at AI Singapore, highlighted the importance of this collaboration in developing AI solutions that resonated with South-East Asia’s diversity and prioritised cultural sensitivity as well as diverse use cases.
 “We aim to align values on security and cultural sensitivity. Understanding what’s sensitive in another country requires local expertise, which is why having Indonesian partners is crucial,” William said.
 Experts have commended the ethical guidance as an initial step toward regulating AI but also noted the need for a deeper understanding on that part of the government about the ecosystem and requirements for cohesive governance involving the public.
 “There’s a good point in the letter, indicating that AI technology shouldn’t replace all existing manpower through automation,” Communication and Information System Security Research Center (CISSReC) chairman Pratama Persadha said.
 On the other hand, as a guideline, it should address targets for system providers and users, especially for developers utilising external models or application programming interfaces (APIs), he said. Additionally, the guideline should highlight the benefits of AI, particularly for public interests.
 “The guidance shouldn’t only be aimed at businesses but also include points for the general public, considering their increasing familiarity with this technology,” emphasised Pratama.
 Rules needed, but which ones?
 Indonesia Cyber Security Forum (ICSF) chairman Ardi Sutedja said that the government still had “a lot to explore” before it could release ethical guidelines on AI, as the country’s tech industry was dominated by consumers rather than developers.
 “Regulations are important,  but the question is, what kind of regulation do we actually need?” Ardi said, noting that the letter was a guideline rather than a directive.
 Dirgantara Adisutjipto Institute of Technology (ITDA) rector and AI expert Arwin Datumaya Wahyudi Sumari echoed a similar sentiment.
 “We’re a nation of consumers, and that’s also the perception the world has of us.

621979,Main,21,02/12/2023,AI spawns new hope in TB fight,,"A PROGRAMME using artificial intelligence to test inmates in a high security Mozambican jail for tuberculosis has spawned hope that the new technology can help eradicate the disease.
 Teeming prisons are a hotbed of TB, the world’s second deadliest communicable disease after Covid-19, according to the World Health Organisation. Mozambique, a country of 32 million people, recorded about 120,000 infections last year.
 Caused by a bacteria that most often affects the lungs, it infected more than 10 million people in 2022 and killed 1.3 million, according to WHO.
 Almost one in four infections last year occurred in Africa.
 In the sprawling courtyard of the maximum security jail in the Mozambican capital Maputo, an inmate in an orange T-shirt stood before a tripod with a wide white tablet.
 Behind him, a doctor scoured a two-piece portable X-ray machine connected to an AI programme that has been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against tuberculosis.
 “It processes it in real time, we have the results in less than five minutes,” the doctor said.
 The image popped on the computer of a technician sitting at a table outside a medical tent a few metres away, along with a diagnosis.
 “Radiological signs suggestive of tuberculosis – negative,” the message said.
 The programme is part of a large test run of the technology to scan all inmates at three prisons in Maputo. It is being conducted by a local non-profit organisation supported by the Stop TB Partnership, a UN-backed entity.
 Early diagnosis is key to save lives and tackle the spread of the disease.
 While a chronic cough is a hallmark of infection, people can also carry TB without showing symptoms. Prisons are a perfect breeding ground due to crammed cells and airborne transmission.
 Traditional spit, skin or blood tests for TB involves visits to a lab and the results can take up to three days. The quickest time for reliable results is 24 hours.
 The combination of AI and portable X-ray machines is faster and eliminates the need for visits to clinics and radiologists, who can be scarce in poor rural areas, said Stop TB’s deputy head Suvanand Sahu. “This is a great leap in technology,” he said.
 At the Maputo Provincial Penitentiary, prisoners testing positive are placed in isolation, locked in a quarantine room behind a rusty metal door.
 Inside, about a dozen inmates wearing face masks sit on mattresses thrown on the ground. Clothing, blankets and other belongings hang from a line strung between two discoloured blue pillars.
 Serious cases are taken to a medical ward.
 Mozambique’s jails were about 50% over capacity in 2022, according to the United Nations.
 “It’s not easy to see your friends playing and walking there but you have to accept that I am sick,” Kennet Fortune, an inmate who has spent 10 year behind bars for drug-related offences, said pointing at the trees in the prison yard.
 He is currently undergoing treatment and the process can take months.
 “When the time comes, I’ll be out,” he said.
 A WHO report last month found that global deaths from tuberculosis dipped in 2022, showing progress towards eradicating the disease. The UN health agency said 7.5 million people were diagnosed with TB in 2022 – the highest figure since it began monitoring in 1995.
 Sahu of Stop TB said he was hoping that the success of pilot programmes could help get funding to scale up the use of AI in diagnosing tuberculosis.
 “Only a few years ago, if I was to say in a meeting that we can bring X-rays to all communities and have them read by a artificial intelligence with no need for radiologists, they would have kicked me out of the room and told me to go write a sci-fi novel,” he said. — AFP",programme artificial intelligence test security mozambican jail tuberculosis hope technology eradicate disease prison deadliest communicable disease covid health organisation mozambique country people infection bacteria lung infected people infection courtyard maximum security jail mozambican capital maputo inmate orange shirt tripod wide white tablet doctor piece portable ray machine programme fight tuberculosis real time minute image computer technician table medical tent metre radiological sign suggestive tuberculosis negative message programme test technology scan inmate prison local profit organisation partnership entity diagnosis key life spread disease chronic cough hallmark infection people symptom prison ground cell airborne transmission traditional spit blood test visit lab day time reliable hour combination portable ray machine visit clinic radiologist poor rural deputy head suvanand sahu leap technology maputo provincial penitentiary prisoner positive isolation quarantine rusty metal door dozen inmate mask mattress ground blanket belonging hang strung blue pillar medical ward mozambique capacity united nation easy friend accept sick kennet fortune inmate spent bar drug offence tree undergoing treatment process month time report month global death tuberculosis progress disease health agency people figure monitoring sahu success pilot programme scale tuberculosis ray community artificial intelligence radiologist told write sci,"[(5, 0.99524665)]",5
620603,StarBiz,9,28/11/2023,‘AI blowback’ angst grips ESG fund managers,Those who bet big on tech fret over experimentation,"LONDON: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) fund managers who turned to big tech as a low-carbon, high-return bet are growing increasingly anxious over the sector’s experimentation with artificial intelligence (AI).
 Exposure to AI now represents a “short-term risk to investors,” said Marcel Stotzel, a London-based portfolio manager at Fidelity International. 
 Stotzel said he was “worried we’ll get an AI blowback,” which he describes as a situation in which something unexpected triggers a meaningful market decline. “It takes just one incident for something to go wrong and the material impact could be significant,” he said. 
 Examples that Stotzel said warrant concern are fighter jets with self-learning AI systems. Fidelity is now among fund managers talking to the companies developing such technologies to discuss safety features such as a “kill switch” that can be activated if the world one day wakes up to “AI systems going rogue in a dramatic way,” he said. 
 The ESG investing industry may be more exposed to such risks than most, after taking to tech in a big way.
 Funds registered as having an outright environmental, social and good governance objective hold more tech assets than any other sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
 And the world’s biggest ESG exchange-traded fund is dominated by tech, led by Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Nvidia Corp. 
 Those companies are now at the forefront of developing AI. Tensions over the direction the industry should take – and the speed at which it should move – recently erupted into full public view.
 This month, OpenAI, the company that rocked the world a year ago with its launch of ChatGPT, fired and then rapidly rehired its chief executive, Sam Altman, setting off a frenzy of speculation. 
 Internal disagreements had ostensibly flared up over how ambitious OpenAI should be, in light of the potential societal risks. Altman’s reinstatement puts the company on track to pursue his growth plans, including faster commercialisation of AI.
 Apple has said it plans to tread cautiously in the field of AI, with chief executive officer Tim Cook saying in May that there were “a number of issues that need to be sorted” with the technology.
 And companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet Inc and Meta Platforms Inc, have agreed to enact voluntary safeguards to minimise abuse of and bias within AI.
 Stotzel said he was less worried about the risks stemming from small-scale AI startups than about those lurking in the world’s tech giants. “The biggest companies could do the most damage,” he said.
 Other investors share those concerns. The New York City Employees’ Retirement System, one of the biggest US public pension plans, said it was “actively monitoring” how portfolio companies use AI, according to a spokeswoman for the US$248bil plan.
 Generation Investment Management, the firm co-founded by former US vice-president Al Gore, told clients that it was stepping up research into generative AI and speaking daily with the companies it’s invested in about the risks – as well as the opportunities – the technology represents.
 And Norway’s US$1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund has told boards and companies to get serious about the “severe and uncharted” risks posed by AI.
 When OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched last November, it quickly became the fastest-growing Internet application in history, reaching 13 million daily users by January, according to estimates provided by analysts at UBS Group AG.
 Against that backdrop, tech giants developing or backing similar technology have seen their share prices soar this year.
 But the absence of regulations or any meaningful historical data on how AI assets might perform over time is cause for concern, according to Crystal Geng, an ESG analyst at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Hong Kong.
 “We don’t have tools or methodology to quantify the risk,” she said. One way in which BNP tries to estimate the potential social fallout of AI is to ask portfolio companies how many job cuts may occur because of the emergence of technologies like ChatGPT. “I haven’t seen one company that can give me a useful number,” Geng said. 
 Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, which helped push Apple and Meta’s Facebook to include privacy in their board charters, has been pressing tech companies to do a better job of explaining their AI work.
 Earlier this year, Trillium filed a shareholder resolution with Google parent Alphabet asking it to provide more details about its AI algorithms.
 Kron said AI represents a governance risk for investors and noted that even insiders, including OpenAI’s Altman, have urged lawmakers to impose regulations. 
 The worry is that, left unfettered, AI can reinforce discrimination in areas such as health care. And aside from AI’s potential to amplify racial and gender biases, there are concerns about its propensity to enable the misuse of personal data. 
 Meanwhile, the number of AI incidents and controversies has increased by a factor of 26 since 2012, according to a database that tracks misuse of the technology.
 Investors in Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet’s Google have filed resolutions demanding greater transparency over AI algorithms.
 The AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund, which oversees US$12bil in union pensions, has asked companies including Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co to report on whether they have adopted guidelines to protect workers, customers and the public from AI harms. 
 Points of concern include discrimination or bias against employees, disinformation during political elections and mass layoffs resulting from automation, said Carin Zelenko, director of capital strategies at AFL-CIO in Washington. — Bloomberg",london environmental social governance esg fund manager low carbon return anxious sector experimentation artificial intelligence exposure short term risk investor stotzel london portfolio manager fidelity international stotzel blowback situation unexpected trigger meaningful market decline incident wrong material impact stotzel warrant concern fighter jet system fidelity fund manager company technology safety feature day system dramatic esg industry risk tech fund outright environmental social governance objective hold tech asset sector bloomberg intelligence biggest esg exchange fund tech apple microsoft corp amazon nvidia corp company tension direction industry speed move public view month company launch chatgpt chief executive sam altman frenzy speculation internal disagreement ambitious openai light potential societal risk altman reinstatement company track pursue growth plan faster commercialisation apple plan field chief executive officer tim cook issue technology company microsoft amazon alphabet meta platform enact voluntary safeguard minimise abuse bias stotzel worried risk scale startup tech giant biggest company investor share concern city employee retirement system biggest public pension plan portfolio company spokeswoman bil plan generation investment management firm vice president gore client generative daily company risk opportunity technology norway sovereign wealth fund board company uncharted risk openai chatgpt fastest internet application history daily user january estimate analyst ubs backdrop tech giant technology share price absence regulation meaningful historical data asset time concern crystal geng esg analyst bnp paribas asset management hong kong tool risk bnp potential social fallout portfolio company job cut emergence technology company geng jonas kron chief advocacy officer boston trillium asset management push apple meta facebook privacy board charter tech company job trillium shareholder resolution google parent alphabet detail algorithm kron governance risk investor insider openai altman lawmaker impose regulation unfettered discrimination health care potential amplify racial gender bias concern propensity enable personal data incident controversy factor database track technology investor apple alphabet google resolution transparency algorithm afl cio equity fund bil union pension company netflix walt disney report guideline worker customer public harm concern discrimination bias employee political election layoff automation carin zelenko director capital strategy cio washington bloomberg,"[(0, 0.99724734)]",0
620313,Lifestyle,4,27/11/2023,AIsidekickon yourshirt,Could a tiny device innovate beyond the smartphone?,"Could artificial intelligence (AI) make your smartphones obsolete?
 After a slow build-up of hype in recent months, a startup run by two former Apple employees has launched their vision of a product that promises to let us use our voices and hands to do most of the stuff we currently do while looking at a smartphone screen.
 The small device, roughly the size of a matchbox, has a camera and loudspeaker, but instead of a display, it has a laser projector that gives you information and playback controls on the palm of your hand.
 The idea behind the Ai Pin, a thin square device measuring less than 5cm in width, is that you attach it to your clothing with a magnet and wear it at chest height.Instead of swiping at a screen, you operate it with voice commands and hand gestures. The camera and microphone play a special role here, as they form the AI’s eyes and ears, so to speak.
 Using its eye, the software can recognise objects around it, as co-founder Imran Chaudhri showed at a demo event earlier this month, holding a handful of almonds in front of the lens and asking how much protein they contain.
 “Fifteen grammes” was the prompt answer. He then showed the Ai Pin a book and had it ordered online.
 When the camera and microphone are switched on, a clearly visible light turns on at the top edge of the device.
 This lets people around the wearer know when they are and aren’t being filmed, photographed or watched by the AI.
 In an interview with technology journalist Om Malik, Chaudhri said that the recordings are only stored on the device itself and in the cloud in a space that is only accessible to the respective users.
 “It doesn’t go anywhere else. No one’s going to use that to learn anything about you.”
 The device might seem like a far leap from our current reality, in which things like navigating, watching content and reading messages seem impossible without a screen.
 And yet Humane isn’t alone in seeing the potential of giving AI access to wearable cameras, microphones and sensors to help us carry out tasks.
 For example, the Facebook group Meta is already selling the second generation of Ray-Ban glasses with a camera and microphone in the United States.
 “Smart glasses are the ideal form factor for you to let an AI assistant see what you are seeing and hear what you are hearing,” Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said.
 Meanwhile, startup RewindAI plans to launch a pendant that records and transcribes everything you say and hear.
 The products do somewhat recall those of Dave Eggers’ dystopian Silicon Valley novel The Circle, which explores the implications of constant surveillance from wearable camera devices.
 And yet the Ai Pin makes an initial impression as being far more practical than creepy, however, and Chaudhri demonstrated how it could help with real-time translation between English and Spanish, while one company ad simply lists handy everyday uses.
 Hold your palm in front of the projector, and it will display information like the current time, music playback controls and updates on the weather.
 The device also connects to wireless earphones like any smartphone, so you can stream music (in this case from Tidal).
 One of the proclaimed goals of Chaudhri and his co-founder and wife, Bethany Bongiorno, was to make frequent interaction with screens unnecessary with the help of AI.Rather than taking out a phone and swiping around on a screen, you ask the software for a summary of recent messages and calls. You can also ask for specific information, such as a door entry code that you once received from a friend.Humane is launching the Ai Pin at US$699 (RM3,250), with a further US$24 (RM110) per month subscription for wireless Internet, a phone number and cloud storage in the US.As such, the device is priced well below premium smartphones, even if it requires a monthly subscription to keep using it.
 And while it could replace many of the smartphone’s tasks in everyday life, the absence of a screen means many will still want a second device with a screen for the likes of TikTok, YouTube and streaming shows.Former OpenAI boss Sam Altman is also an investor in Humane, which has been collaborating with its ChatGPT AI to deliver bespoke answers. – dpa",artificial intelligence smartphones obsolete slow build hype month apple employee vision product voice hand smartphone screen device size matchbox camera loudspeaker display laser projector playback palm hand idea pin thin square device width attach clothing magnet chest height screen operate voice command hand gesture microphone play special role form eye speak eye software recognise founder imran chaudhri demo event month handful almond front lens fifteen gramme prompt answer pin book online camera microphone visible light top edge device people photographed interview technology journalist malik chaudhri recording device cloud space accessible respective user device current reality content reading message impossible screen humane potential access wearable camera microphone sensor task meta selling generation ray ban glass microphone united smart glass ideal form factor assistant hear meta chief executive mark zuckerberg startup rewindai plan launch pendant record hear product egger dystopian silicon valley circle implication constant surveillance wearable camera device pin initial impression practical creepy chaudhri real time translation english spanish company handy everyday palm front projector display current time music playback weather device connects wireless earphone smartphone stream music tidal goal chaudhri founder wife bethany bongiorno frequent interaction screen unnecessary phone screen software summary message specific door entry code friend humane pin month subscription wireless internet phone cloud storage device premium smartphones monthly subscription smartphone task everyday life absence screen device screen tiktok youtube openai bos sam altman investor humane chatgpt bespoke answer,"[(2, 0.9961037)]",2
619751,Main,25,26/11/2023,India’s growing AI challenge,"Artificial Intelligence is gripping  the country’s elections, especially AI-generated Bollywood songs featuring its prime minister, Narendra Modi.","ARTIFICIAL Intelligence-generated Bollywood songs, some featuring India’s prime minister Narendra Modi, are popular in the Assembly elections due to digital technology. A video shows Modi playing the guitar while sitting cross-legged. His voice has been rendered in recent Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada videos. There are over two million views for Modi’s Instagram video singing Telugu and over 2.7 million for a Tamil-language song going viral.
 A Punjabi song with Modi’s voice gained over 17 million views. Falu, an Indian-American singer, has received a Grammy nomination for her song “Abundance in Millets”, featuring the Prime Minister. Congress and the BJP have used AI-powered voice cloning tools. They send personalised messages to voters and party workers.
 Ashok Gehlot, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, is notable for this. Some television channels have introduced AI TV anchors in Odiya, Kannada and Hindi. Artificial Intelligence has transformed healthcare in India significantly. Advanced diagnosis, treatment, and patient care tools have improved doctors’ services. In other areas, AI is found useful. A recent World Economic Forum report says that India’s expenditure on AI is expected to reach US$11.78bil (RM55.16bil) by 2025.
 It will contribute to an addition of US$1 trillion to India’s economy by 2035. The prime minister is keen on fostering further AI development in India. 
 All these bring us to the question of whether AI is gradually gripping the world. At the first AI Safety Summit hosted by the UK at the historic Bletchley Park on Nov 1, political and industry leaders discussed the risks around artificial intelligence and how to develop the technology safely. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had convened a meeting with over a hundred world and industry leaders. About 28 countries participated, including the United Nations and the European Union.
 US Vice President Kamala Harris represented the US. India, represented by Minister of State Rajeev Chandrashekhar, said, “We want AI and tech to represent goodness, safety and trust”: The revolution in artificial intelligence was the focus. Rapid progress in AI is arousing fear as well as excitement. The participants ranged from doomsayers to participants who hoped AI would save humanity.
 They addressed the global nature of the issue and stressed the need for international cooperation and healthy competition. Sunak has said he’s worried about humanity losing control of computers. The role of AI in cyberattacks was also discussed. These could make the global financial system go haywire and threaten democracy. AI can impersonate at a scale and speed never known. “We want AI and tech to represent goodness, safety and trust,” said Minister of State Chandrasekhar.
 The conference was undoubtedly a good start. India is planning to host another meeting in December. As the host nation, the UK was the first to announce the formation of an official AI Safety Institute to examine the safety of emerging forms of AI. At the end of the conference, participating countries agreed on a declaration. It read: “The Bletchley Declaration stresses safe, responsible AI development, urges international cooperation to mitigate risks, and promotes global benefits.”
 Rapid progress in AI is arousing fear as well as excitement. Will the machine become so powerful that it can replace humans? Google CEO Sunder Pichai said, “Knowledge workers, writers, accountants, architects and, ironically, software engineers would face a threat to their jobs. 
 He noted, “You come in the morning. When you have a lot to review, AI can help you prioritise what needs your attention.”
 The risk of terrorist groups using generative AI tools and concerns that AI will become uncontrollable by humans are additional concerns. 
 AI concerns will include real-time cybersecurity, supply chain efficiency, software development acceleration, and customer service automation in the coming year. 
 It cannot engage in negative thoughts or understand cause and effect. It also cannot comprehend time. Supporters note that AI can be used for voter registration and verification. Politicians would benefit from using AI for predictive analysis of voter behaviours.
 AI can analyse social media to gauge sentiment and identify critical issues for political campaigns to tailor their messages. Moreover, AI is crucial in maintaining election security by detecting and preventing fraud, hacking attempts, and other irregularities. It can use historical data and current events to predict election outcomes. AI-powered chatbots can provide voters with polling locations, candidate profiles, and additional crucial election-related information. The first summit was a success in bringing these people together.
 And it goes beyond politicians. There has yet to be an international regulatory body. Nothing is binding here. Ultimately, we have to find the answer to questions like should we automate all jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart and replace us?
  That is the crux of the AI issue. Still, moving to AI will take time to happen. — The Statesman/ANN",artificial intelligence bollywood song india prime minister narendra popular assembly election digital technology video modi guitar cross voice hindi tamil telugu kannada video view instagram video telugu tamil language song viral punjabi song modi voice view falu indian american singer grammy nomination song abundance millet prime minister congress powered voice cloning tool personalised message voter party worker gehlot chief minister rajasthan notable television channel anchor hindi artificial intelligence healthcare india diagnosis treatment patient care improved doctor service economic forum report expenditure reach bil contribute addition india economy prime minister keen development india question safety summit historic bletchley park nov political industry leader risk artificial intelligence technology british prime minister rishi sunak meeting industry leader country united nation union vice president kamala harris minister rajeev chandrashekhar tech represent goodness safety trust revolution artificial intelligence focus rapid progress fear excitement participant doomsayers participant save humanity global nature issue international cooperation healthy competition sunak humanity control computer role cyberattacks global financial system haywire democracy impersonate scale speed tech represent goodness safety trust minister chandrasekhar conference start india planning host meeting december host nation formation official safety institute examine safety form conference country declaration read bletchley declaration safe responsible development international cooperation mitigate risk global benefit rapid progress fear excitement machine powerful human ceo sunder pichai knowledge worker writer accountant architect software engineer threat job morning lot review prioritise attention risk generative tool concern uncontrollable human additional concern concern real time cybersecurity supply chain efficiency software development acceleration customer service automation negative understand comprehend time supporter voter registration verification politician predictive analysis voter behaviour analyse social medium gauge sentiment critical issue political campaign tailor message crucial maintaining election security fraud attempt irregularity historical data current event election outcome chatbots voter location profile additional crucial election summit success people politician international regulatory body answer question job human mind outsmart crux issue time happen statesman ann,"[(2, 0.2754292), (6, 0.72220874)]",6
619281,StarBiz,4,24/11/2023,"AI poster child Altman is back, may have fewer checks on power",,"SAM Altman’s return as OpenAI’s chief executive will strengthen his grip on the startup and may leave the ChatGPT creator with fewer checks on his power as the company introduces technology that could upend industries, corporate governance experts and analysts said.
 OpenAI is bringing Altman back just days after his ouster as well as installing a revamped board that could bring sharper scrutiny to the startup at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but strong support from investors including Microsoft may give Altman more leeway to commercialise the technology.“Sam’s return may put an end to the turmoil on the surface, but there may continue to be deep governance issues,” said Mak Yuen Teen, director of the centre for investor protection at the National University of Singapore Business School.
 “Altman seems awfully powerful and it is unclear that any board would be able to oversee him. The danger is the board becomes a rubber stamp,” he said.
 OpenAI’s new board will boast more experience at the top level and strong ties to both the US government and Wall Street.
 The board fired Altman last week with little explanation and attempted to move on by naming an interim chief executive officer (CEO) twice. 
 However, pressure from Microsoft – and the 38-year-old’s strong loyalty among the 700-plus OpenAI employees that caused nearly all of them to threaten to leave the company –led to Altman’s reinstatement as of Wednesday.
 “Altman has been invigorated by the last few days,” GlobalData analyst Beatriz Valle said. But that could come at a cost, she said, adding that he has “too much power now.”
 Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce who also played a key role in forcing through Elon Musk’s US$44bil purchase of Twitter as a director, will be chairing the board.
 Other members include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a Harvard academic and longtime economic aide to Democratic presidents.
 “The fact that Summers and Taylor will join OpenAI is quite extraordinary and marks a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the company,” Valle said.
 Summers, who also sits on the board of Jack Dorsey’s fintech firm Block, has in recent months been vocal about the potential job losses and disruption that could be caused by AI.
 “ChatGPT is coming for the cognitive class. It’s going to replace what doctors do,” he said in a post on X in April.
 OpenAI’s previous board consisted of entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, as well as Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, who also sits on the new board.
 It was not immediately clear if any of the other directors would remain, including Sutskever, who joined in the effort to fire Altman then signed onto an employee letter demanding his return, expressing regret for his “participation in the board’s actions”.
 OpenAI on X said it was “collaborating to figure out the details” of the new board. Microsoft declined to comment. 
 Summers and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sutskever, Altman and Taylor could not be immediately reached for comment.
 Some analysts say the management fiasco will ensure that OpenAI executives proceed cautiously, as the high-flying startup will now be subject to more scrutiny. 
 Several noted that companies such as Facebook parent Meta have flourished with a powerful CEO despite concerns about corporate governance.
 “Sam definitely comes out stronger but also dirtied and will have more of a microscope from the AI and broader tech and business community,” Gartner analyst Jason Wong said. 
 “He can no longer do no wrong.” — Reuters

618583,StarBiz,12,22/11/2023,OpenAI in ‘intense discussions’ to quell potential staff mutiny,,"NEW YORK: OpenAI says it’s in “intense discussions” to unify the company after another tumultuous day that saw most employees threaten to quit if Sam Altman doesn’t return as chief executive officer (CEO).
 Vice-president of Global Affairs Anna Makanju delivered the message in an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg News, aiming to rally staff who’ve grown anxious after days of disarray following Altman’s ouster and the board’s surprise appointment of former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as his interim replacement.
 OpenAI management is in touch with Altman, Shear and the board “but they are not prepared to give us a final response this evening”, Makanju wrote.
 The drama surrounding the company behind ChatGPT has transfixed the technology world and set off a race by OpenAI investors to contain the damage. 
 On Monday, more than 700 of the startup’s 770 staff signed a letter saying they would quit if the board doesn’t resign and re-hire Altman, who was recruited by Microsoft Corp – OpenAI’s largest shareholder – to run a new artificial intelligence (AI) team.
 The chaos engulfing the US startup, which kicked off a global generative AI development frenzy, has the potential to reshape the world of AI. 
 The threat of a mass exodus followed a roller-coaster weekend that saw OpenAI’s board defied calls from investors and executives to reinstall Altman, who was fired following disagreements with the board on how fast to develop and monetise AI.
 The memo from Makanju doesn’t elaborate on the extent of contact with Altman, and the former CEO didn’t respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
 There’s strong momentum outside OpenAI to get Altman reinstated too. 
 OpenAI’s other investors, led by Thrive Capital, are actively trying to orchestrate his return, people with knowledge of the effort told Bloomberg News on Monday. 
 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Emily Chang in a Bloomberg Television interview that even he wouldn’t oppose Altman’s reinstatement. 
 Microsoft, which has pledged to invest as much as US$13bil in OpenAI, benefits whether Altman is running OpenAI or working under its roof, Nadella said.
 Until last Friday, the company’s board consisted of Altman, president Greg Brockman, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora Inc CEO Adam D’Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, director of strategy at Georgetown’s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology. 
 After Altman’s exit, Brockman stepped down in protest.
 Sutskever later said he “deeply regretted” his participation in the ouster, and added his name to the letter from employees threatening to quit.
 “We are continuing to go over mutually acceptable options and are scheduled to speak again tomorrow when everyone’s had a little more sleep,” Makanju wrote. “These intense discussions can drag out, and I know it can feel impossible to be patient.”
 She added a word of reassurance for employees: “Know that we have a plan that we are working towards.”
 OpenAI, which was in talks with investors about an US$86bil valuation, now faces an end to its stunning growth. 
 And it will face close scrutiny over its ability, or willingness, to turn cutting-edge AI into profits.
 It’s not clear whether investors, OpenAI executives or even Microsoft will be able to turn back the clock. The directors who ousted Altman to begin with would have to walk back their decision.
 Vinod Khosla, co-founder at Khosla Ventures, one of OpenAI’s earliest backers, said he believes D’Angelo is dug in. 
 “If Adam does what Ilya did then, yes, it’s a smooth path,” he said in an interview. “If he doesn’t, it’s a multi-month legal battle.” 
 D’Angelo didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
 At the heart of the divide between Altman and OpenAI’s directors is whether AI should be a commercial opportunity, or is a potentially dangerous technology that needs to be checked and scrutinised at every turn.
 The board clashed with Altman and Brockman, who both argued that OpenAI was growing its business out of necessity. 
 Every time a customer asks OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot a question, it requires huge amounts of expensive computing power, so much that the company was having trouble keeping up with the explosive demand from users.
 The company was forced to cap the number of times users can query its most powerful AI models daily. In fact, the situation got so dire that Altman at one point announced the company was pausing sign-ups for its paid ChatGPT Plus service indefinitely. — Bloomberg",york penai intense discussion company tumultuous day employee quit sam altman return chief executive officer ceo vice president global affair message internal memo bloomberg news rally staff anxious day altman ouster board surprise appointment twitch chief emmett shear interim replacement openai management touch altman board final response makanju drama company chatgpt technology race openai investor monday startup staff letter quit board resign hire altman microsoft corp largest shareholder artificial intelligence team chaos startup global generative development frenzy potential reshape threat mass exodus roller coaster weekend board investor executive disagreement board monetise memo makanju elaborate extent contact altman ceo respond request comment regular business hour strong momentum openai altman openai investor thrive capital orchestrate return people effort bloomberg news monday microsoft ceo satya nadella bloomberg television interview altman reinstatement microsoft invest bil openai benefit altman openai roof nadella friday company board altman president greg brockman chief scientist ilya sutskever ceo adam angelo tech entrepreneur tasha mccauley helen toner director strategy georgetown centre security technology altman exit brockman protest sutskever regretted participation letter employee quit acceptable option speak tomorrow sleep makanju intense discussion impossible patient word reassurance employee openai talk investor valuation growth scrutiny ability willingness edge profit investor executive microsoft clock director altman walk decision vinod khosla founder khosla venture earliest backer angelo dug adam ilya smooth path interview multi month legal battle angelo respond request comment heart altman openai director commercial opportunity dangerous technology board altman brockman openai business necessity time customer openai chatgpt chatbot question huge amount expensive power company trouble explosive demand user company cap time user powerful model daily situation dire altman company sign chatgpt service bloomberg,"[(0, 0.23369338), (2, 0.76355714)]",2
618707,Main,27,22/11/2023,OpenAI faces mass exodus,"Staff threaten to quit, join ex-CEO Altman","San Francisco: Hundreds of staff at OpenAI threatened to quit the leading artificial intelligence company and join Microsoft, deepening a crisis triggered by the shock sacking of CEO Sam Altman.
 In a fast-moving sequence of events, Altman, who was ousted by the board on Friday, has now been hired by Microsoft where he will take the lead in developing a new advanced AI research team.
 There was talk Monday that OpenAI is interested in Altman returning, and that he may be open to the idea under certain conditions.
 “We want to partner with Open AI and we want to partner with Sam so irrespective of where Sam is he’s working with Microsoft,” chief executive Satya Nadella said in a streamed Bloomberg interview.
 “That was the case on Friday. That’s the case today. And we absolutely believe that will be the case tomorrow.”
 In a letter released to media on Monday, the vast majority of OpenAI’s 770-strong staff suggested they would follow Altman unless the board responsible for his departure resigned.
 “Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI,” the letter said.
 “Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join.”
 A key AI executive at Microsoft confirmed that they all were welcome to join from OpenAI if the board that removed Altman does not resign.
 Among the signatories was co-founder Ilya Sutskever, the company’s chief scientist and a member of the four-person board who pushed Altman out.
 “I deeply regret my participation in the board’s actions,” Sutskever said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
 “I never meant to harm OpenAI.”
 Another signatory was top executive Mira Murati, who was appointed to replace Altman as CEO when he was removed, but didn’t last the weekend in the job.
 “We are all going to work together some way or other, and I’m so excited,” Altman said on X.
 OpenAI has appointed Emmett Shear, a former chief executive of Amazon’s streaming platform Twitch, as its new CEO despite pressure from Microsoft and other major investors to reinstate Altman.
 After the startup’s board sacked Altman, US media cited concerns that he was underestimating the dangers of its tech and leading the company away from its stated mission – claims his successor has denied.
 Nadella wrote on X that Altman will lead a new advanced AI research team at Microsoft, joined by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman.

618107,Lifestyle,5,20/11/2023,The allure of AI,Job seekers are drawn to ads that mention artificial intelligence.,"RECENT advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to change or render obsolete millions of jobs.
 While this prospect raises fears among employees, it is also prompting some to anticipate this evolution in the job market by applying for vacancies that mention AI.
 This surprising trend is highlighted in a new LinkedIn report. Its authors found that recruitment ads alluding to this booming technology particularly attract the attention of job seekers.
 Over the past two years, they have seen 17% greater growth in the number of applications than those not mentioning AI. This progression proves that AI is a hot topic in the workforce.
 And this appears to be a global phenomenon, since the job offers analysed by LinkedIn for the purposes of this study were written in a multitude of languages, including French, English, Mandarin and Turkish.
 Erin Scruggs, vice president of global talent acquisition at LinkedIn, sees this as evidence of the adaptability of many professionals.
 “Candidates are savvy. They’re showing they want to go where opportunities are,” she says.
 The specialist recommends that companies outline their AI strategy in detail in the job advertisements they post in order to help working people envision what promises to be a revolution in the professional world.
 AI may be a hot topic, but experts the world over are still unable to say precisely what its effects on the job market will be.The American bank Goldman Sachs estimated in March that AI systems could automate 300 million jobs in the near future. This would represent a quarter of global activity.
 Employment website Indeed goes even further in one of its latest studies, claiming that all jobs posted on its platform will be impacted by this technology.
 While opinions differ, there is no doubt that today’s and tomorrow’s workers will have to learn to collaborate effectively with AI.
 They need to consolidate their knowledge and skills to meet the new needs for complementarity between humans and machines.
 But working people don’t necessarily need to become experts in “prompt crafting” or robotic systems to secure a professional future in an increasingly automated society.
 The US multinational tech corporation IBM states in its “Augmented Work For An Automated, AI-Driven World” report that human talents will enable people to stand out in the job market.But focusing on “soft skills” will not be enough.

614876,Main,17,10/11/2023,‘Gain experience using AI’,"We must understand the pitfalls to regulate it, says PM Lee","WHILE there are still many unknowns about artificial intelligence, Singapore has to gain experience operating with it and understanding the pitfalls so that it can make smart decisions to regulate it, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
 He acknowledged that currently, his government, like most governments, do not know more about it than those in the tech industry.
 PM Lee was speaking at a dialogue with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum gala dinner on Wednesday.
 Asked whether AI was a bigger development than the Internet, PM Lee said: “The first thing you must know is that there are a lot of things you don’t know.”
 For AI, most do not know where it is headed, even researchers, he noted.
 From when the idea of AI first came about, it took a long time, about 50 to 70 years, for it to reach its present stage, with the existence of technology such as ChatGPT.
 And the thought in the minds of researchers was constantly that they were about to make a breakthrough – which did eventually come about. But would it progress all the way to the point of having a conversation, said Lee.
 He added: “Either the chatbot can interview me, or I may interview the chatbot... Or two chatbots may be talking to each other better than us.”
 Perhaps putting in 10 times more chips or 10 times more effort in computing, AI could reach that level, or it could also reach a limit, he said.
 “Then you need another breakthrough conceptually, to take it to the next level where it’s got insight, understanding, judgment, reasoning and empathy,” said PM Lee.
 In principle, there is no reason why a machine that can think, act, speak and look like it feels like a human being cannot be built, he added.
 “Some philosophers think it’s not possible. I don’t believe that. I think it is possible but I don’t know how long it will take,” he said.
 But when that happens, there will be some profound questions thrown up that are difficult to answer, he added.
 If the AI bot is as smart as a human, it will not be possible to pre-program it to be stupid enough to be killed – and that is a fundamental contradiction, said Lee.
 Earlier this month, Lee had virtually attended the inaugural global Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit, at the invitation of British PM Rishi Sunak.
 He had spoken about Singapore’s practical, risk-based approach to AI development and deployment, as well as the importance of including diverse multi-stakeholders in the conversation and collaboration on AI safety. — The Straits Times/ANN",unknown artificial intelligence gain experience understanding pitfall smart decision prime minister lee hsien acknowledged government government industry dialogue bloomberg news editor chief john micklethwait bloomberg economy forum gala dinner wednesday bigger development internet lee lot researcher idea time reach stage existence technology chatgpt researcher progress conversation lee interview interview chatbots time chip time effort level reach limit level insight judgment empathy lee principle reason machine speak feel human philosopher profound question difficult answer smart human pre program stupid fundamental contradiction lee month attended inaugural global artificial intelligence safety summit invitation british rishi sunak practical risk approach development deployment diverse multi stakeholder collaboration safety strait time,"[(3, 0.9912961)]",3
614068,StarBiz,12,08/11/2023,Meta bars political ads using generative AI tools,,"NEW YORK: Facebook owner Meta is barring political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative artificial intelligence (AI) advertising products, a company spokesperson says, denying access to tools that lawmakers have warned could turbo-charge the spread of election misinformation.
 Meta publicly disclosed the decision in updates posted to its help centre on Monday night, following publication of this story. Its advertising standards prohibit ads with content that have been debunked by the company’s fact-checking partners but do not have any rules specifically on AI.
 “As we continue to test new Generative AI ads creation tools in Ads Manager, advertisers running campaigns that qualify as ads for housing, employment or credit or social issues, elections, or politics, or related to health, pharmaceuticals or financial services aren’t currently permitted to use these Generative AI features,” the company said in a note appended to several pages explaining how the tools work.“We believe this approach will allow us to better understand potential risks and build the right safeguards for the use of Generative AI in ads that relate to potentially sensitive topics in regulated industries,” it said.
 The policy update comes a month after Meta – the world’s second-biggest platform for digital ads – announced it was starting to expand advertisers’ access to AI-powered advertising tools that can instantly create backgrounds, image adjustments and variations of ad copy in response to simple text prompts.
 The tools were initially made available only to a small group of advertisers starting in the spring. 
 They are on track to roll out to all advertisers globally by next year, the company said at the time.
 Meta and other tech companies have raced to launch generative AI ad products and virtual assistants in recent months in response to the frenzy over the debut last year of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, which can provide human-like written responses to questions and other prompts.
 The companies have released little information so far about the safety guard rails they plan to impose on those systems, making Meta’s decision on political ads one of the industry’s most significant AI policy choices to come to light to date.
 Alphabet’s Google, the biggest digital advertising company, announced the launch of similar image-customising generative AI ads tools last week. It plans to keep politics out of its products by blocking a list of “political keywords” from being used as prompts, a Google spokesperson told Reuters.
 Google has also planned a mid-November policy update to require that election-related ads must include a disclosure if they contain “synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events”.
 TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap both bar political ads, while X, previously known as Twitter, has not rolled out any generative AI advertising tools.

612584,Lifestyle,22,05/11/2023,Will AI take my job?,"It’s a question that should prompt employers to consider more than just the bottom line, according to an expert.","THE meteoric rise of AI (artificial intelligence) has catapulted the world into uncharted territory.
 That’s good news for futurists like Amy Webb, who studies emerging technologies and uses quantitative and qualitative modelling to forecast how they’ll impact business and society.
 As founder and CEO of the Future Today Institute, Webb has been grappling with AI and all its concomitant fears, from end-of-humanity doomsday scenarios to market flash crashes and job destruction.
 Webb was fielded questions at the SXSW conference in Sydney. The questions and responses have been edited and condensed.
 How is AI affecting worker productivity?AI can greatly improve productivity for cognitive jobs where there’s a lot of reading, sorting and tagging, which you often find at professional services firms, law firms and investment banks.
 It takes fewer people hours to do those tasks, and you can ask an AI system to find patterns that you may have missed. That said, it’s still humans using the tech. 
 There are plenty of cases where there is ample technology around us and people are somehow less productive.
 Humans are sort of biologically wired to expend as little energy as possible – it’s literally within our cellular structure – so I am curious as to whether this indulges our innate sense of laziness going forward and what that might mean.
 What will AI do to the job market?People ask, “Is AI taking my job? Or taking a bunch of jobs?” But nobody’s asking what it would take for that to be true.
 We don’t have enough plumbers anywhere, right? In medicine, we’ve come a long way. You can use AI systems with computer vision to spot anomalies. But for AI to truly replace a knowledge worker, it requires the workers themselves to do the training to train these AI systems.
 For instance, medical students are being offered money in certain parts of the world to sit for eight hours a day and click “Yes or No” through something called reinforcement learning with human feedback as training.
 But that’s ultimately a drop in the ocean. It’s much more productive to ask, “How is the business model changing going forward?” For example, the billable hourly rate structure is going to have to change for some industries.
 What are C-suite executives talking to you about AI and new technologies?They’re interested in having very basic conversations. To have more advanced, nuanced conversations requires leaning into uncertainty.
 A bank CEO recently asked me how AI can reduce headcount. But if you start adopting AI as a way of only improving your bottom line through a reduction in salaries, you’re going to wind up with a problem in a couple of years, if not sooner.
 What should they be thinking about?AI is a series of different technologies, and there are tools that can be created with it. In a handful of years, there’re going to be different types of jobs needed, so CEOs need to be very careful when making short-term decisions because it improves the bottom line.
 The real opportunity is in top-line growth and figuring out where they can create new revenue streams, improve relationships and make it a force multiplier.
 That’s where most leaders should be placing their energy at the moment, but that’s not what I see happening in any country around the world.
 What good questions are CEOs asking you related to AI?They’re asking what it takes for us to be resilient versus how soon we can lay people off.
 What are people confusing?AI, at the moment, has become sort of a shorthand for ChatGPT. The non-technical side of organisations is just talking about it as a text-based system that gives answers.
 What’s concerning to you?Once your data has been used to train a system, how do you know who owns it and how do you monetise it going forward?
 The real question should be, “Where is it getting the information? Am I okay with that? Do I trust it?” Once you’ve given away your archive and allowed it to be used to train an AI system, you can’t get it back out.
 What’s next?Multimodal. This is having an AI system that can do multiple things at once. Engaging different forms of logic, reasoning and analysis.
 So that can be used for more complex challenges or decision points that a leader might encounter during the day, provided there is enough context.
 Do you have any interesting examples where you’ve tested AI?I was keynoting a large financial services conference, and the panel before mine was something about loan syndication, far outside my domain expertise.
 I copied and pasted the description of the programme and the panellists into a couple of AI chat tools and asked each system to have the panel and tell me what the insights would be. Aside from the charts, graphs and linguistic flare that each person brought, there was really no discernible difference to the actual panel. – Bloomberg",meteoric rise artificial intelligence uncharted territory news futurist webb study technology quantitative qualitative modelling forecast impact business society founder ceo future institute webb concomitant fear humanity scenario market crash job destruction webb question sxsw conference sydney question response condensed worker productivity improve productivity cognitive job lot professional service firm law firm investment bank fewer people hour task system pattern human tech plenty ample technology people productive human energy cellular structure curious indulges sense laziness job market people job bunch job true plumber system computer vision spot anomaly knowledge worker worker train system instance medical student money sit hour day reinforcement human feedback training drop ocean productive business model billable hourly rate structure change industry executive technology basic conversation nuanced conversation uncertainty bank ceo headcount start bottom reduction salary couple sooner series technology tool handful type job careful short term decision bottom real opportunity top growth create revenue stream relationship multiplier leader energy moment country question resilient versus people people moment sort shorthand chatgpt technical organisation text system answer train system real question trust archive train system system multiple form logic analysis complex challenge decision leader encounter day context example financial service conference panel mine loan syndication domain expertise pasted description programme couple system panel insight chart linguistic flare person discernible difference actual panel bloomberg,"[(1, 0.99569446)]",1
612638,Main,23,05/11/2023,AI governance should be on security agenda,"Artificial intelligence is fundamentally altering the nature of warfare,  raising concerns about the possible misuse, abuse, and indiscriminate  use of the new hi-tech weapons.","THE development and application of artificial intelligence are profoundly changing the ways in which human society evolves and people live, and they are fundamentally altering the nature of warfare. While it empowers various industries, it has also raised concerns and worries about the possible misuse, abuse, and indiscriminate use of AI weapons. 
 China’s Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, released in February, calls for strengthening international security governance in emerging technologies, including AI, highlights the key directions for enhancing international security governance of military AI, and issues position papers on the military application and ethical governance of AI, strengthens communication and exchanges with the international community on AI security governance, promotes the establishment of a participatory international mechanism, and forms a governance framework and standard norms with broad consensus.
 I. Challenges in international security governance of military AI 
 In February 2023, the first global Summit on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain held in The Hague passed a “Call to Action” emphasising the importance of responsible development and use of military AI systems, and reflecting some basic consensus in the international community regarding international norms for the military application of AI. Yet only slightly over 60 out of the more than 80 countries represented at the conference supported the “call to action”. 
 Achieving broad consensus and coordinated action in the international security governance of military AI still faces numerous challenges.
 There is significant disagreement in the international community regarding the rules for lethal autonomous weapon systems. Many developing countries and non-governmental organisations, represented by the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Union, strongly advocate restricting or even banning lethal autonomous weapon systems and call for the creation of a legally binding international instrument on this matter. 
 Some developed countries, typically the European Union, emphasise the dual-use nature of AI and advocate a non-legally binding political declaration. 
 Some big countries have a relatively passive attitude toward arms control for lethal autono­mous weapon systems and firmly oppose the establishment of an international treaty banning lethal autonomous weapon systems.
 Geopolitical confrontations significantly hinder global unity and cooperation among countries. Currently, great power competition and confrontations have peaked since the end of the Cold War, with a few countries being forcibly excluded from international cooperation frameworks and systems, lacking channels for comprehensive participation in discussions and the formulation of international norms for military applications of AI. 
 For instance, because of the Ukraine crisis, Russia has not been invited to participate in relevant summits on the responsible use of AI in the military and has even been deliberately restricted from engaging in related dialogues and negotiations.
 AI is a collective achievement of human intelligence and thus whole humanity should benefit from it. However, certain countries create technological barriers that restrict cooperation and exchange in AI. 
 At the same time, the potential risks associated with the autonomous and inexplicable nature of AI technology require global collaboration. While some countries like the US verbally vow strong support for international cooperation in the responsible use of AI, they also treat AI technology as a tool to maintain their own dominance in geopolitical competitions. 
 They form exclusive “small circles” or “small groups” and artificially create technological barriers in areas closely related to the development and application of AI, such as chips and 5G communication, obstructing international exchanges in AI technology. This has become a stumbling block for international cooperation in responsible AI governance.
 II. Suggestions for promoting the construction of an international security governance framework for military AIAlthough it is still difficult to reach an international treaty on regulating the military application of AI, China has proposed ideas and plans on how to promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind in the field of AI. 
 In December 2021, China released the Position Paper of the People’s Republic of China on Regulating Military Applications of Artificial Intelligence to the Sixth Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, advocating that all countries should uphold a global security concept featuring common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable development, seek consensus on how to regulate the military application of AI through dialogue and cooperation, and establish an effective governance mechanism. 
 The “Global Security Initiative Concept Paper” once again pointed out that China is willing to strengthen communication and exchanges with the international community on AI security governance, promote the establishment of a widely participated international mechanism, and form a governance framework and standard specifications with broad consensus. 
 Following are suggestions on how to construct an international security governance framework for the military application of AI:
 > Forge broad consensus – From the perspective of building a global community of shared future, we should give full play to the role of the United Nations platform, widely forge consensus among developed countries, emerging economies, and developing countries on the pursuit of the development, application, and security governance of AI. We should fully consider the reasonable concerns of different countries, ethnic groups, and religious backgrounds, and establish guiding principles that integrate values and ethics, security and controllability, fairness and inclusiveness, openness and tolerance, and peaceful utilisation.
 > Define the responsibilities of participants – The stakeholders of military AI security governance not only include sovereign states and non-state actors that use AI weapons, but also include parties involved in research and development, manufacturing, testing and evaluation, as well as supervision agencies of relevant industries and international organisations. 
 In response to the possible consequences of misuse and abuse of military AI, it is necessary to differentiate responsibilities among relevant stakeholders and jointly assume the responsibilities and obligations of military AI security governance.
 > Define the governance content – Military AI security governance must scientifically define the objects to be governed, so that relevant laws and regulations can be implemented with specific background constraints. Thus it is necessary to clarify that security governance should focus on the risks, harm, and negative impacts that may be caused by the military  application of AI. 
 Scientific assessments should be conducted on accidents with different levels of damage, security risks of different types and levels, and negative impacts in different scenarios and fields, and reasonable discretion should be given to different stakeholders in tracing their responsibilities.
 > Improve governance tools – Military AI security governance requires complex governance tools for support. These tools include both macro-level ethical guidelines and guiding principles, as well as specific laws and regulations, technical standards, and policy mechanisms. 
 They can also include relevant databases, prototype systems, and testing and evaluation certification tools. The development of these governance tools requires both the proactive actions of sovereign states and the evaluation and supervision of industry associations and international organisations.
 > Expand communication platforms – Military AI security governance involves a wide range of factors and is constantly evolving, even with elements of confrontation and gaming among different parties. 
 It is necessary for sovereign states, industry enterprises, and international organisations to actively expand communication platforms, strengthen cross-field, cross-departmental, and cross-regional cooperation and exchanges, share new knowledge and experiences, and resolve conflicts and differences. 
 Countries such as China, the US, and Russia, which are at the forefront of military AI technology, need to strengthen communication and dialogue, explore the establishment of relevant trust measures, avoid the escalation of wars and conflicts and humanitarian disasters caused by the misuse and abuse of AI, promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind in the field of military application of AI, and work together with the international community to maintain global strategic stability and human peace and welfare. – China Daily/Asia News Network

 They believe the technology can help fill security gaps in the rural areas caused by the high concentration of police personnel in Seoul and the metropolitan area.
 The police will also seek to use artificial intelligence to improve their investigative abilities and the technology to combat voice phishing.
 The plan includes a programme to ­develop an algorithm that analyses ­unusual online behaviour patterns to predict stalking and sex crimes.
 Also, research is under way to develop technology that uses security cameras to detect abnormal behaviour and whether someone is carrying a weapon.
 To better tackle drug trafficking, a real-time map to keep track of drug cases to help trace distribution routes will be built.
 Other plans include establishing a police agency metaverse, developing a system to automatically track banned virtual assets, and creating a cyber training institution at the Advanced Public Security Centre.
 In addition, officers will be provided with bulletproof clothing and strength-­enhancing robotic augmentations to their uniforms.
 South Korea has seen an increase in economic and financial crimes, with the number rising from 290,000 in 2015 to 410,000 in 2020.
 The number of drug offenders is also up, with the number of people investigated for drug crimes jumping from 12,000 in 2018 to 18,000 in 2020.
 In the first half of 2023, a total of 925 cases of murder, bodily harm or assault took place. And 18 of them were classified as serious crimes with abnormal motives, commonly referred to as mudjima or “don’t ask why” attacks – unprovoked and sudden acts of violence targeting strangers.

 In Singapore, this phenomenon may be felt in jobs such as credit decision-makers, field engineers, curriculum designers and consultants, according to the study, which was presented at a conference on Wednesday.
 As tasks get automated, standardised and redistributed through simplification and offshoring, professionals will find jobs falling in quality.
 Middle-class aspirations here could come under strain as a result because professionals and degree holders form the fastest-growing category of workers earning middle wages, defined in the study as those earning 75% to 150% of median income.
 Managers, in contrast, will gain greater clout.
 Professor Phillip Brown, distinguished research professor at Cardiff University and director of the research programme, explained this with an example of the health service in Britain.
 “The doctors or the academics have a lot of control and then, over time, managers come in to coordinate and organise moves onto (technological) platforms,” he said on the sidelines of the event.
 “The managerial control is likely to become greater through those technologies and it will strip out aspects of knowledge work from the professionals and technicians.”
 The findings were presented to 250 delegates at the Digital Futures of Work Global Conference 2023, which was organised by the Institute for Adult Learning (IAL), an autonomous institute of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. It was held at Voco Orchard Hotel.
 Funded by SkillsFuture Singapore, the Digital Futures of Work Research Programme took place over four years from 2019 and covered more than 500 interviews and quantitative analyses of AI adoption patterns in places such as Silicon Valley, Singapore and London.
 More than 80 senior executives from 60 companies in Singapore were interviewed, and data from the Singapore Skills and Learning Survey conducted between 2021 and 2022 was analysed for the study.
 It need not be a surrender of “destiny” to technology; AI can still impact jobs positively if society intervenes in how companies use AI, said Brown.
 “We did seek out companies that were doing things differently,” he said. These firms recognise humans as a differentiator and recognise that if everybody has got the technology, their competitive edge will be their people.
 These firms might, for example, let most of their workers experiment with AI tools, or tap AI tools to connect groups with different know-how to enhance collaboration.
 Helsinki and Berlin, digital hubs like Singapore with a high concentration of tech activities, have prioritised using AI to enhance professional work and opportunities rather than substitute well-paid workers, the study said.
 Sahara Sadik, assistant director for research at the IAL and deputy director of the research programme, called for a more deliberate AI transition.
 Firms can be more creative and agile by designing new job functions and use of AI together with workers, rather than dropping top-down policies onto their workforce. 
 “What we are putting forward is that there is a need for social response if we truly believe that technology is going to benefit everyone,” she said in a speech. — The Straits Times/ANN",professional managerial duty firm artificial intelligence drive cost productivity global study contrary expectation low middle role social scientist phenomenon job credit decision maker field engineer designer consultant conference wednesday task simplification professional job quality middle class aspiration result professional holder fastest category worker middle wage study median income manager gain clout professor phillip professor cardiff university director programme health service britain doctor lot control time manager organise move technological platform sideline event managerial control technology aspect professional technician finding delegate digital future global conference institute adult ial autonomous institute singapore university social science voco orchard hotel skillsfuture singapore digital future interview quantitative analysis adoption pattern valley singapore london senior executive company data skill survey analysed study surrender destiny technology impact job intervenes company brown seek company firm human recognise technology competitive edge people firm worker tool tool connect enhance collaboration helsinki berlin digital hub singapore concentration tech activity enhance professional opportunity worker sahara sadik assistant director ial deputy director programme deliberate transition firm job function worker top policy social response technology benefit speech time,"[(2, 0.11244022), (3, 0.8832087)]",3
610466,Main,4,30/10/2023,AI poised to write the next chapter in literary research,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Embracing the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in literature research is transforming the literary studies landscape, says Prof Nie Zhenzhao (pic) of  Zhejiang University.
 He believes that authors should accept AI’s transformative impact on literary theory, accelerate the reconstruction of scientifically-­based literary theories, and tackle the challenges that literature currently faces.
 The emergence of AI-written literature had begun to challenge current theories, potentially prompting changes in literary research concepts, he said.
 He added that literary theory needed to move beyond old frameworks and undertake a scientific reconstruction, especially emphasising the study of literary principles.Prof Nie highlighted the inaugural release in AI literature, Microsoft’s 2017 poetry collection, The Sunlight That Lost The Glass Window.
 According to him, this groundbreaking work was created by Microsoft’s AI, Xiaoice, an AI system that studied the works of 519 poets from the last century in just 100 hours.
 “Achieving this would only be possible for accomplished human poets
 “Just like a gifted young poet, Xiaoice can understand emotions and convey her insights through poetry even more efficiently than some human poets.
 “Will Xiaoice replace poets? Will poets become redundant, and authors too? We cannot ignore these questions,” he said during a panel discussion on “The Scientific Turn in Literary Studies and AI” at the international conference on the “Development and Future of Sinology in the 21st Century”.
 Prof Nie also cited the example of ChatGPT, which could outperform some human poets, potentially up to the college or graduate level.
 These advanced AI systems, he said, could analyse large volumes of data to learn and create poetry in novel and innovative ways.
 “Subjective emotions do not influence AI’s creativity. It perceives poetry differently, free from personal bias,” he said.
 Prof Nie recommended an approach to address the impending challenges in literature, in which adopting technology could provide substantial benefits in investigating the basic tenets of literary theories.
 This strategy involved employing versatile research methods, fostering interplay between literary studies and its associated fields, which could lead to innovative reinterpretations and a restructuring of the literary theory framework, he added.",kuala lumpur rise artificial intelligence literature literary study prof nie zhenzhao pic zhejiang university author transformative impact literary theory accelerate reconstruction literary theory challenge emergence literature current theory literary concept literary theory move framework scientific reconstruction study literary principle inaugural release literature microsoft poetry collection glass window microsoft xiaoice system poet century hour accomplished human poet poet xiaoice understand emotion insight human poet poet poet redundant author question panel discussion scientific literary study international conference development future sinology century prof nie chatgpt outperform human poet college graduate level system analyse volume data create poetry innovative subjective emotion influence creativity perceives free personal bias prof nie approach address challenge technology substantial benefit basic tenet literary theory strategy versatile method interplay literary study field innovative reinterpretation literary theory framework,"[(4, 0.99306)]",4
610258,Lifestyle,10,29/10/2023,Shaping the future of AI,,"EVER wonder how Homo sapiens got so smart? How come we developed actual language when all the other animals didn’t? How about what first made a nematode turn its body in a different direction? Or … what’s a nematode?
 Answers to those questions and much, much more can be found in the pages of Max Bennett’s new book A Brief History Of Intelligence: Evolution, AI And The Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains. 
 At 365 pages plus 45 more with a glossary, chapter notes and a bibliography, readers can quibble whether it’s indeed brief, but it is certainly thorough.
 Bennett’s premise – he’s a software entrepreneur who founded a company called Bluecore that “helped predict what consumers would buy before they knew what they wanted” – is that humans won’t ever create true artificial intelligence without understanding exactly what led to the real intelligence we already possess. 
 So he begins with those nematodes – worms, to you and me – and painstakingly details the five breakthroughs that over the course of billions of years evolved into the three-pound brain that is folded into all of our skulls.
 The first half of the book is a touch dry, detailing not only what caused worms to turn (food!), but how fish learn via trial and error and the pivotal role the basal ganglia plays in dictating behaviour, among many, many other evolutionary developments. 
 Bennett cites the work of psychologists and neuroscientists every step of the way and includes plenty of charts and graphs to make his points. It can feel like you’re reading a textbook at times. 
 But to his credit, he begins each new chapter with actual prose, as in this description of the Cambrian explosion more than 500 million years ago: “The gooey microbial mats of the Ediacaran that turned the ocean floor green would have long since faded and given way to a more familiar sandy underbelly. 
 The sensible, slow, and small creatures of the Ediacaran would have been replaced by a bustling zoo of large mobile animals as varied in form as in size.”
 When Bennett begins to connect the evolution of the human brain to where we are in the development of artificial intelligence is when the book, for this reader, gets more interesting. Why can’t machines truly learn? 
 Even ChatGPT, which every industry seems to be embracing these days, can’t “learn things sequentially,” writes Bennett. 
 “They learn things all at once and then stop learning.” 
 We’ve trained ChatGPT using the entire contents of the Internet, but the software can’t learn new things because of the risk that it will forget old things, or learn the wrong things.
 Bennett is intelligent enough not to draw any conclusions about AI in a field that is changing daily, but he does end his book with a challenge. 
 Evolution gave us our magnificent human brain, he writes, and now that we are in a position to play god and create a new form of intelligence, we must first decide on our goal – are we destined to spread out across the cosmos? Or will we fail, victims of pride or climate change or something yet unseen, just another branch on the evolutionary tree, which will grow on without humans and perhaps never add a limb called “Artificial Intelligence?” 
 No reader alive today will live long enough for that answer, but Bennett makes a solid case for why reverse engineering the human brain may lead to future breakthroughs in the science of AI. – AP",homo sapiens actual language animal body direction nematode answer question bennett book history intelligence evolution breakthrough brain glossary chapter note reader quibble bennett premise software entrepreneur company bluecore predict consumer human true artificial intelligence real intelligence posse nematode detail billion pound brain skull half book touch dry detailing worm food fish trial error pivotal role basal play behaviour evolutionary development cite psychologist neuroscientist plenty chart time credit chapter actual prose description cambrian explosion gooey microbial mat ocean floor green familiar sandy slow creature zoo mobile animal form size bennett connect evolution human brain development artificial intelligence book reader machine chatgpt industry day bennett learn learning chatgpt entire content internet software learn risk forget wrong bennett intelligent draw conclusion field daily book challenge evolution magnificent human brain writes position god create form intelligence decide goal spread cosmos victim climate change unseen branch evolutionary tree grow human limb artificial intelligence reader alive live answer bennett solid reverse engineering human brain lead future science,"[(2, 0.9945139)]",2

 But the chatbot, which features a Shiba Inu cartoon dog and answers in the Osaka dialect, has shown itself far from faithful to the truth.
 When a user asked about the World Expo planned in Osaka  in 2025, the dog incorrectly responded that the event was cancelled.
 That answer gained public attention, with Japanese newspapers and broadcasters reporting on the dog who got the wrong end of the stick.
 “Dai-chan, you’re good,” one social media user joked.
 Despite slow progress and budget challenges, the world  fair is still scheduled to go  ahead.
 Among other incorrect answers, Dai-chan said the “G7 foreign ministers’ meeting will be held on Nov 4” rather than the slated  Nov 7-8.

608824,StarBiz,10,26/10/2023,Qualcomm unveils new PC laptop chip with AI features,,"San Diego: Qualcomm has given details about a chip for Microsoft Windows-based laptops that it claims will be faster at some tasks than Apple’s chips for Mac computers.
 Qualcomm executives said the company’s new Snapdragon Elite X chip will be available in laptops starting next year and has been redesigned to better handle artificial intelligence (AI) tasks like summarising emails, writing text and generating images.
 Those AI features will also factor into Qualcomm’s chips for smartphones, with Alphabet’s Google and Meta both saying yesterday they planned to take advantage of them.
 The announcement comes a day after Reuters reported Microsoft has encouraged Qualcomm, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to come up with new chips to handle a bevy of new AI features in Windows, the world’s most popular PC operating system.
 During a video appearance at Qualcomm’s event, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the chips would help usher in a new era of “AI PCs” for businesses and consumers.
 “The work we’re doing together, it’s going to bring together these experiences that cannot be done without a new system architecture,” Nadella said.
 Qualcomm will be the first to market with a chip to challenge Apple, whose laptop and desktop computers have more than doubled their market share since the iPhone maker introduced custom-designed chips in 2020.
 Qualcomm claimed yesterday the X Elite is faster than Apple’s M2 Max chip at some tasks and more energy efficient than both Apple and Intel PC chips.
 But Qualcomm senior vice-president Alex Katouzian said the biggest new feature is the chip can handle AI models with 13 billion parameters, a proxy measure of sophistication for AI systems that generate text or images. — Reuters",san diego qualcomm detail chip microsoft window laptop claim task apple chip computer executive company chip handle artificial intelligence task email text generating image feature qualcomm chip smartphones meta yesterday advantage announcement day reuters microsoft qualcomm advanced micro device chip bevy feature popular operating system video appearance qualcomm event microsoft chief executive satya nadella chip era pc business consumer experience system architecture nadella qualcomm market chip challenge apple laptop desktop computer market share iphone maker custom chip yesterday faster apple max chip task energy efficient apple intel chip senior vice president alex katouzian biggest feature chip handle model parameter proxy measure sophistication system text image reuters,"[(2, 0.9915598)]",2
608826,StarBiz,10,26/10/2023,Microsoft beats estimates ahead of AI rollout,,"San Francisco: Microsoft has beaten Wall Street estimates for fiscal first-quarter results in all segments, with its cloud computing and PC businesses growing as customers anticipate using its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings.
 Its forecast also was mostly ahead of analyst targets.
 Microsoft, which has heavily backed and collaborated with OpenAI, has yet to roll out most of the products based on its work with the ChatGPT creator. 
 But enthusiasm among corporate technology buyers for features like the ability to summarise heaps of email into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code helped the company’s revenue rise 13% to US$56.5bil in the quarter ended Sept 30.
 That compares with analysts’ consensus estimate of US$54.52bil, according to London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) data.
 “The results indicated that artificial intelligence products are stimulating sales and already contributing to top and bottom-line growth,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. Microsoft shares were up 3% in after-hours trading.
 In the reported quarter, revenue from Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which houses its Azure cloud-computing platform where much of the AI work will take place, grew to US$24.3bil, compared with analysts’ estimate of US$23.49bil, LSEG data showed. Azure revenue rose 29%, higher than a 26.2% growth estimate from market research firm Visible Alpha.
 Brett Iversen, Microsoft’s vice-president for investor relations, said much of the quarterly sales growth came from customers rekindling their use of Microsoft’s cloud in anticipation of using AI services.
 “What AI is doing is opening up either new conversations or extending existing conversations or getting us back in touch with customers that we maybe weren’t doing as much with,” Iversen said.
 By comparison, Google-parent Alphabet’s cloud division missed estimates for third-quarter revenue yesterday as an uncertain economy and high interest rates led its customers to trim their budgets.
 “While a single quarter doesn’t a major trend make, this quarter’s cloud results from Microsoft and Google suggest that Azure is gaining share against its competition,” said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. 
 “It could be that Microsoft’s very strong messaging on their (AI) technology is getting companies to consider them in a more serious way.”
 Microsoft said fiscal first-quarter profit was US$2.99 per share, above analyst estimates of US$2.65 per share, according to LSEG data.
 “There are some weaker areas; search advertising revenues, for one, is growing slower than most segments,” said Jeremy Goldman of research firm Insider Intelligence.
 Microsoft said search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased by 10%. It does not break out the revenue figure for these operations.

608138,StarBiz,13,24/10/2023,Fund managers banking on SK Hynix as AI winner,,"SEOUL: Shares of Samsung Electronics Co are on track to underperform those of its smaller memory chip rival SK Hynix Inc by the most in a decade as investors bet the latter will be the winner in artificial intelligence (AI).
 SK Hynix has surged 67% this year thanks to its deal to supply premium high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to Nvidia Corp, trouncing Samsung, which is up 24% as it struggles to get its HBM offering off the ground. 
 That gap may widen further judging by options data, which show the put-to-call ratio on Samsung more than double that of SK Hynix. 
 The AI battle is pitched against the backdrop of weak global demand for the companies’ traditional memory products. 
 That’s due in large part to smartphones, which are mired in what could be the worst industry wide slump in over a decade, hurting another key source of revenue for Samsung.
 Chips remain hot overall thanks to the surge in demand for products needed to power generative AI services like ChatGPT. 
 The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 31% this year, outpacing gains in nearly any benchmark you can think of.
 Samsung has another way to tap this growth, as it also provides contract chip-manufacturing services. 
 But it’s missing out here as well because Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co dominates foundry business, producing the lion’s share of AI processors designed by Nvidia and others. 
 So after years of leading the memory industry, Samsung is now seen needing to play catchup in HBM, an advanced technology optimised to work with AI accelerators. 
 HBM features a stack of DRAM that sits on top of a processor instead of being housed in a separate memory module, enabling faster data transfer.
 SK Hynix, more of a “pure-play” memory maker than its diversified peer, was able to get a jump on the latest generation of the chip, winning Nvidia as a customer for its HBM3. 
 Samsung reportedly had trouble finalising a contract with the US AI giant for its offering, though it has developed a new HBM3E chip and said it plans to introduce an HBM4 by 2025.
 “This is a really unfamiliar scene,” with Samsung falling behind SK Hynix in HBM development, said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. 
 “Everyone is focused on AI as that’s the only area where we see strong demand.”
 Yoon sees securing a client such as Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices Inc as key for Samsung’s share price. Other observers point to yield, the amount of good chips it can produce from each batch of material, as the main thing for investors to monitor. — Bloomberg",seoul share electronics underperform memory chip rival hynix decade investor winner artificial intelligence hynix deal supply premium bandwidth memory hbm chip corp trouncing samsung hbm offering ground gap judging option call ratio samsung double hynix battle backdrop weak global demand company traditional memory product smartphones worst industry wide slump decade key source revenue chip hot surge demand product power generative service philadelphia semiconductor gain benchmark samsung tap growth contract chip manufacturing service taiwan semiconductor manufacturing foundry business lion share processor leading memory industry catchup hbm technology accelerator feature dram sits top processor separate memory module faster data transfer hynix pure play memory maker peer jump generation chip nvidia customer hbm samsung trouble contract giant offering chip plan hbm unfamiliar scene samsung hynix hbm development yoon joonwon fund manager asset management strong demand yoon client micro device key samsung share price observer amount chip batch material main investor bloomberg,"[(0, 0.6026548), (3, 0.3921028)]",0

 National Association of Private Educational Institutions (Napei)secretary-general Dr Teh Choon Jin said while the government’s proposed AI study centre at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) is a commendable and forward-thinking step for the future of higher education, replicating the initiative in other universities can create a network of expertise and research collaboration across the country.
 “It would allow Malaysia to build a comprehensive ecosystem for AI research, development and education, strengthening its position in the global AI landscape,” he said, adding that there should be collaboration with other public or private universities that are doing research in AI to maximise the benefits of such research for the nation.
 During the tabling of Budget 2024 on Oct 13, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced that the country’s first AI study centre would be set up at UTM with an initial allocation of RM20mil to intensify the exploration of cross-disciplinary AI.
 A centralised AI centre for private higher education institutions can facilitate cross-collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers in the field, said Vice Chancellors’ Council for Private Universities (VCCPU) chairman Prof Mushtak Al-Atabi.
 Budget 2024, said Prof Mushtak, highlighted a lot of potential to propel economic growth, foster job opportunities, and attract international investments.
 The latest developments in AI have brought us to a critical juncture where machines are making the leap into the cognitive realm, he added.
 “This juncture offers us a unique opportunity to reconfigure our approach to education, economy, community, business and government, fostering a greater pursuit of what truly matters: the realisation of our ultimate potential. 
 “This involves the discovery and articulation of our purpose and channelling our efforts towards making a positive impact on the world,” he said, adding that the proposed AI centre at UTM is a groundbreaking initiative with far-reaching implications for the future of Malaysia.
 By prioritising AI and robotics, the country is on a trajectory to become a technological leader, cultivating the skills necessary for a new era, and promoting a brighter and more prosperous future for all, he said.
 “Having said this, while we strive to harness the potential of AI in education, it is crucial to remember the enduring significance of human interaction. 
 “Education is more than the mere transfer of knowledge; it is about driving purpose, fostering holistic development, nurturing character, and cultivating curiosity.
 “As we journey into this brave new world, let’s do so with a strong commitment to ethics, equity, and the holistic development of individuals,” he added.
 Teh said the Budget 2024 allocation for the AI centre is a huge stepping stone towards Malaysia’s digital transformation.
 “AI is a transformative technology with applications in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing and education.
 “By investing in an AI study centre, the government is taking a proactive approach to harnessing AI’s potential to drive innovation and economic growth. 
 “It signals a commitment to leveraging AI as a key driver of Malaysia’s digital transformation,” he said.
 UTM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Fauzi Ismail said the country’s first AI study centre, or Faculty of AI, will be multidisciplinary in nature.
 The upcoming faculty, he said on the public varsity’s website, will make AI a catalyst for innovation in various fields, including manufacturing, finance, health, agriculture, renewable energy, security, economy and climate change.
 UTM, he said, accepts the trust and responsibility of setting up the Faculty of AI to help develop the nation.
 The varsity, he said, is also optimistic that the faculty would be able to advance human civilisation following the Malaysia Madani mould.
 He said UTM pioneers AI extensively and is already home to the Centre for AI and Robotics (CAIRO), the Big Data Centre (BDC), the IJN-UTM Cardiovascular Engineering Centre, the Institute of Human Centered Engineering (iHumEn), and the Institute for Vehicle Systems and Engineering (IVeSE).
 There are more than 100 AI experts across the varsity’s study centres comprising academics from the faculties of computing, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical and energy engineering, sciences, technology and informatics, management, and architecture and surveying; and the Malaysia-Japan International Institute of Technology (MJIIT).

604640,Lifestyle,5,16/10/2023,AIof the tiger,Conservationists are using tiny cameras to help ‘protect’ endangered predators – and people.,"Tiger populations are on the rise in the jungles of India and Nepal, and the predators are roaming ever closer to villages, sparking a race among conservationists to find ways of avoiding conflict.
 They are increasingly finding solutions with artificial intelligence (AI), a bunch of technologies designed to reason and make decisions like humans.
 Experts from Clemson University in South Carolina and several non-profit groups (NGOs) published research last month on their work using AI-enabled cameras that they say could help revolutionise tiger conservation.
 They placed tiny devices around enclosures in the two South Asian nations, both to protect villagers from the predators and the predators from poachers.
 According to their research, published in the BioScience journal, the camera system called TrailGuard can distinguish between tigers and other species and relay images to park rangers or villagers within seconds.
 “We have to find ways for people, tigers and other wildlife to coexist,” Eric Dinerstein, one of the authors of the report, said.
 “Technology can offer us a tremendous opportunity to achieve that goal very cheaply.”
 The research claims the cameras were immediately effective, picking up a tiger just 300m from a village and, on another occasion, identifying a team of poachers.They say their system was the first AI camera to identify and transmit a picture of a tiger, and it has almost wiped out false alarms – when traps are tripped by passing boars or falling leaves.
 The scheme is one of several putting an AI spin on the established ideas of wildlife surveillance.
 Researchers in Gabon are using AI to sift their camera trap images and are now trying a warning system for elephants.
 Teams in the Amazon are piloting equipment that can detect the sounds of chainsaws, tractors and other machinery associated with deforestation.
 And US tech titan Google teamed up with researchers and NGOs four years ago to collect millions of images from camera traps.
 The project, called Wildlife Insights, automates the process of identifying species and labelling images, saving many hours of laborious work for researchers.Conservationists like Dinerstein, who also leads the tech team at the Resolve NGO, are sure that technology is helping their cause.‘Early warning system’
 Their goal is to ensure that 30% of the Earth’s land and oceans are designated protected zones by 2030, as agreed by dozens of governments last year, with that number eventually going up to 50%.
 Those zones will need to be monitored, and animals will need to move safely between protected areas.
 “That’s what we’re shooting for, and the critical element of that is an early warning system,” he said.
 The plight of tigers underscores the size of the challenge.
 Their habitats have been devastated across Asia, and their numbers in India fell to an all-time low of 1,411 in 2006 before steadily rising to current levels of around 3,500.
 In the mid-20th century, India was home to an estimated 40,000.
 ‘Jury still out’
 Jonathan Palmer, head of conservation technology at the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), who was not involved in the study, said TrailGuard had exciting potential.
 But Palmer, who helped found Wildlife Insights with Google, said the broader uses of AI in conservation were not yet settled.
 “In most cases, AI species identification is still in its infancy,” he said.
 His NGO recommends outside verification of any species identification done by AI.
 And Palmer said the “jury was out” on whether AI was better deployed in cameras at the scene or afterwards on servers or laptops.
 Those uncertainties aside, Dinerstein is widening the rollout of TrailGuard, this time with even bigger animals in his sights.
 “Elephants wander outside parks all the time, and it leads to a massive amount of conflict,” he said.
 They destroy crops, cause chaos in villages, and can even cause train crashes, resulting in dozens of deaths every year, he added.

604362,Main,28,15/10/2023,Legislators are still looking for a definition for AI,,"BACK in March in the United States, Hawaii state Senator Chris Lee introduced legislation urging US Congress to consider the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.
 But he didn’t write it. AI did.
 Lee instructed AI-powered ChatGPT to write a piece of legislation that highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI. Within moments, it produced a resolution. Lee copied and pasted the entire text without changing a word. The resolution was adopted in April with bipartisan support.
 “It was making a statement that using AI to write legislation – a whole law – was perhaps the single biggest thing we could do to demonstrate what the good and the bad of AI could be,” said Lee.
 While organisations and experts have tried to define artificial intelligence, there is no consensus on a single definition. That leaves lawmakers the world over grappling with how to understand the technology so they can put rules in place.
 The National Artificial Intelli-gence Initiative Act of 2020 sought to define AI, describing it as “a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments,” according to the federal law enacted Jan 1, 2021.
 President Joe Biden’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights extends the definition to “automated systems that have the potential to meaningfully impact the Ame-rican public’s rights, opportunities or access to critical resources or services”.
 The European Union, Google and many more entities have spelled out similar but differing definitions. But AI experts and legislators are still identifying a conclusive definition – and weighing whether a concrete definition is even necessary to pursue a regulatory framework.
 At the most basic level, AI refers to machine-based systems that produce an outcome based on information inputted to it, said Sylvester Johnson, associate vice provost for public interest technology at Virginia Tech.
 However, various AI programmes work based on how these systems have been trained to use data, which, Johnson said, legislators need to know.
 “AI is very fast moving,” he said. “If you really want people who make policy and legislative assemblies at the federal level or state levels to be richly informed, then you need an ecosystem that is designed to provide some kind of concise and precise way of updating people about trends and changes that are happening in the technology.”
 Deciding how broad the definition of AI should be is a significant challenge, said Jake Morabito, the director of the Communications and Technology Task Force at the American Legislative Exchange Council. 
 The “light touch” approach to regulating AI would help the US become a leader in technology on the global stage, but given the fervour over ChatGPT and other systems, legislators at all levels should be studying its developments for better understanding, Morabito said.
 “I just think this technology’s out of the bag, and we can’t put it back in the bottle,” Morabito said. “We need to fully understand it. And I think lawmakers can do a lot to get up to speed on understanding how we can maximise the benefits, mitigate the risks and make sure that this technology is developed on our shores and not abroad.”
 Some experts think legislators don’t need a definition to govern artificial intelligence. When it comes to an application of artificial intelligence – a specific area where AI is being used – a definition isn’t entirely required, argued Alex Engler, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.
 Instead, he said, a core set of rules should apply to any programme that uses automated systems, no matter the purpose.
 “You can basically say, ‘I don’t care what algorithm you’re using, you have to meet these criteria,’” Engler said. “Now, that isn’t to say there’s literally no definition, it just means that you’re not counting some algorithms in and others out.”
 Focusing on the specific systems, such as generative AI that’s capable of creating text or images, may be the wrong approach, he said.
 The core question, Engler said, is this: “How do we update our civil society and our consumer protections so that people still have them in an algorithmic era?”
 Legislation some states passed over the last few years has attempted to answer the question. 
 The potential harms that come with using artificial intelligence are creating momentum for more regulation. 
 For example, some AI tools can produce tangible harm by replicating human biases, yielding decisions or actions that favour certain groups over others, said Megan Price, executive director of the Human Rights Data Analysis Group.
 “And so, the question really is when a mistake is made, what is the cost and who pays it?” she asked.
 A new focus on social justice in technology is also worth noting, Virginia Tech’s Johnson said. “Public interest technology” is a growing movement among social justice groups that’s focused on how artificial intelligence can work for public good and public benefit.
 “I think if there’s a reason to be hopeful about actually advancing our ability to regulate technology in a way that improves people’s lives, and their outcomes, this [public interest technology] is the way to go,” Johnson said. –  Stateline.org/Tribune News Service",march hawaii senator chris lee legislation congress benefit risk artificial intelligence technology lee chatgpt write piece legislation highlight potential benefit drawback moment resolution lee pasted entire text changing word resolution april bipartisan support statement write legislation law single biggest demonstrate bad lee organisation expert artificial intelligence consensus single definition lawmaker understand technology rule national artificial intelli gence initiative sought define machine system human objective prediction recommendation decision real virtual federal law jan president joe blueprint bill right definition system potential impact ame rican public right opportunity access critical resource service european union google entity definition expert legislator conclusive definition concrete definition pursue regulatory framework basic level refers machine system outcome inputted sylvester johnson associate vice public technology virginia tech programme system data johnson legislator people policy legislative assembly federal level level ecosystem concise precise people trend technology broad definition challenge jake morabito director communication technology task force american legislative exchange council touch approach leader technology global stage fervour chatgpt system legislator level development morabito technology bag bottle morabito understand lawmaker speed maximise benefit risk technology shore expert legislator govern artificial intelligence application artificial intelligence specific definition alex engler fellow governance study institution core set rule programme system algorithm meet criterion definition algorithm specific system generative capable text image wrong approach core question engler update civil society consumer protection people era legislation attempted answer question potential artificial intelligence momentum regulation tool tangible harm human bias decision action megan price executive director human right data analysis question mistake cost pay social justice technology virginia tech johnson public technology movement social justice artificial intelligence public public benefit reason hopeful ability regulate technology people outcome public technology johnson stateline tribune news service,"[(1, 0.9967144)]",1
603368,StarBiz,10,12/10/2023,S-E Asia countries opt for business-friendly AI rules,Direction runs counter to European Union’s ambitions,"SINGAPORE: South-East Asian countries are taking a business-friendly approach to artificial intelligence (AI) regulation in a setback to the European Union’s (EU) push for globally harmonised rules that align with its own stringent framework.
 Reuters reviewed a confidential draft of the 10-member Asean “guide to AI ethics and governance”, whose content has not previously been reported.
 Three sources told Reuters the draft is being circulated to technology companies for feedback and is expected to be finalised at the end of January 2024 during the Asean Digital Ministers Meeting. Companies that have received it include Meta , IBM and Google.
 EU officials earlier this year toured Asian countries in a bid to convince governments in the region to follow its lead in adopting new AI rules for tech firms that include disclosure of copyrighted and AI-generated content.
 In contrast to the EU’s AI Act, the Asean “AI guide” asks companies to take countries’ cultural differences into consideration and doesn’t prescribe unacceptable risk categories, according to the current version reviewed. Like all Asean policies, it is voluntary and is meant to guide domestic regulations.
 With almost 700 million people and over a thousand ethnic groups and cultures, south-east Asian countries have widely divergent rules governing censorship, misinformation, public content and hate speech that would likely affect AI regulation. Thailand, for example, has laws against criticising its monarchy.
 Technology executives say Asean relatively hands-off approach is more business friendly as it limits the compliance burden in a region where existing local laws are already complex and allows for more innovation.
 “We are also pleased to see this guide aligns closely with other leading AI frameworks, such as the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework,” IBM Asia’s vice president of government affairs Stephen Braim said, referring to voluntary guidelines developed by NIST.
 Meta and Google did not respond to request for comment.
 The guide, which is meant to be periodically reviewed, urges governments to aid companies through research and development funding and sets up an Asean digital ministers working group on AI implementation.
 Senior officials in three Asean countries said they are bullish on the potential of AI for south-east Asia and believe the EU has been too quick to push for regulation before the harms and benefits of the technology are fully understood.
 The Asean guide advises companies to put in place an AI risk assessment structure and AI governance training, but leaves specifics to companies and local regulators.
 “We see it as putting ‘guardrails’ for safer AI,” one official told Reuters. “We still want innovation.”
 The guide warns of the risks of AI being used for misinformation, “deepfakes”, and impersonation, but leaves it to individual countries to work out the best way to respond.
 Other Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea have flagged similarly relaxed approaches to AI regulation, casting doubts over the EU’s ambition to establish a global standard for AI governance based on the rules that would apply to its 27 member states.
 Driving the EU push are concerns in Brussels about the rapid pace of AI development and its effect on civil rights and security, which have put risk controls and enforcement at the centre of the proposed legislation.
 While Asean does not have any powers to make laws, its preference for member states to make their own policy determinations puts those countries on a distinctly different track to the EU.
 The EU’s struggles to create global consensus on AI regulation contrast with its mostly successful campaign last decade to establish data protection laws that have become a template for other major economies around the world.
 “What we think is important is to have similar principles,” a European Commission spokesperson told Reuters. “We are not seeking full harmonisation, as we are mindful of cultural differences, however, we regard the underlying principles as important.”
 EU officials and lawmakers said that the bloc would continue to hold talks with south-east Asian states to align over broader principles. — Reuters",singapore south east asian country business artificial intelligence regulation setback european union push rule align stringent framework reuters confidential draft asean guide ethic governance content source reuters technology company finalised january asean digital minister meeting company meta ibm google official toured asian country convince government region lead rule tech firm disclosure content contrast asean guide company country cultural difference consideration prescribe unacceptable risk category current version asean policy voluntary guide domestic regulation people ethnic culture east asian country divergent rule censorship misinformation public content hate speech regulation thailand law monarchy technology executive hand business friendly limit compliance burden region local law complex innovation guide aligns framework national institute standard technology nist risk management framework ibm asia vice president government affair braim voluntary guideline nist meta google respond request comment guide urge government aid company development set asean digital minister implementation senior official asean country bullish potential south east asia quick push regulation benefit technology understood asean guide company risk assessment structure governance training specific company local regulator guardrail official reuters innovation guide risk misinformation deepfakes impersonation individual country asian nation south korea relaxed approach regulation casting doubt ambition global standard governance rule push concern brussels rapid pace development civil right security risk control enforcement centre legislation asean power law preference policy determination country global consensus regulation contrast successful campaign decade data protection law major economy principle european commission spokesperson reuters harmonisation mindful cultural difference principle official lawmaker hold talk east asian align broader principle reuters,"[(2, 0.10985906), (4, 0.88711375)]",4
602864,Main,14,10/10/2023,Seoul to use  AI to enhance public safety,Rise in concern over safety on  the subway after violent incidents,"Seoul has   unveiled plans for developing an artificial intelligence-based system to monitor and track unusual behaviour among subway passengers, inclu­ding instances of violence, with the goal of completing the system by the end of the year.
 The announcement from Seoul Metro and the Seoul Digital Foun­dation comes in the wake of a series of incidents that have heightened public concern about safety on the subway.
 These include a stabbing incident in August that saw two passengers injured.
 In September, a rush was also provoked by a false alarm about a stabbing on the same subway line and injured 18 passengers.
 The project’s objective is to create a real-time monitoring and detection system for identifying abnormal behaviour among subway passengers. 
 This will be done by utilising AI-powered “image captioning” technology. This technology translates images or video footage into textual descriptions.
 The generated text can then be forwarded to subway officials for immediate action should an incident take place.
 The two organisations signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday last week for the project and have set the goal of completing the design and technical testing phase by December.
 They plan to choose one station for initial testing. After successful initial tests, the system will be expanded to cover all stations and subway cars by 2025.
 Seoul Metro said the project is expected to bolster the response capabilities of the authorities during critical situations by fostering collaboration between the police and subway security personnel.
 “The AI-powered system for detecting and tracking abnormal behaviour will evolve into a technology that enables a more effective response to incidents targeting members of the public,” said Baek Ho, chief executive officer of Seoul Metro.

600446,StarBiz,13,05/10/2023,"Adopt AI or be left  behind again, says Son",Softbank working with Microsoft to market OpenAI,"TOKYO: SoftBank Group Corp’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son has implored a Japanese audience to embrace artificial intelligence (AI), making an impassioned speech for early adoption at his first public appearance in months.
 Japan, which largely missed the initial wave of growth from the Internet, can’t afford to lose another three decades, Son said during an upbeat keynote address at SoftBank World, an annual event for the tech investor’s domestic corporate clients. 
 Noting that more than 70% of companies in Japan either ban or are considering banning the use of generative AI, Son waved his arms in frustration.
 “Saying ‘Don’t use AI’ is like saying, don’t drive a car or use electricity,” he said yesterday. “Whether you like it or not, the AI revolution will come.”
 Son has stayed away from the public eye this year after suffering what he called a crisis of confidence over mounting losses at SoftBank’s flagship Vision Fund. 
 But a surge in interest in AI, spurred by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, along with the initial public offering of chip architect Arm Holdings Plc last month appears to have revived his spirits.
 The Vision Fund, which invested billions of dollars into hundreds of startups, lost more than US$30bil in the last financial year and shifted into a defensive, largely dormant mode. 
 But now SoftBank, which is sitting on more than US$40bil in cash, is preparing to go back on the offensive again, executives have said. 
 Son’s enthusiasm for AI was on display during his 90-minute presentation, which began with an illustration of a goldfish in a fishbowl. 
 People who refuse to use AI will end up akin to that goldfish, unable to process information like language, he said. 
 The sum of knowledge that AI will command will be 10 times that of all humanity within 10 years, he added.
 Arm chief executive officer (CEO) Rene Haas appeared during Son’s presentation to explain how the chip designer’s power-efficient architecture will become even more key with the spread of AI-wielding devices in the future. 
 SoftBank is embracing AI, Son said. SoftBank Corp, Japan’s third-largest wireless carrier, has tied up with Microsoft Corp to market OpenAI services in the country and is working on its own Japanese language chatbot. 
 The telecom firm has sway over payments arm PayPay Corp, messaging app Line and search engine Yahoo Japan.
 “Wake up, Japan!” Son told his audience. The CEO said he likes to watch ChatGPT-bots debate as a cheaper alternative to watching his directors argue over ideas.

 A total of 80 million Vietnamese residents use the Internet out of a total population of 99 million as of January, which contributes to the popularity of social networking platforms.
 Therefore, the potential for conversational commerce in Vietnam is wide, according to the experts.
 Telecommunications service providers in the country have used conversational commerce platforms for account notifications and to offer hyper-personalised promotions and discounts to customers.
 In addition to Facebook and Instagram, Vietnamese are very active in using communication apps such as Zalo and Viber.
 Furthermore, eCommerce is one of the fastest-growing business segments in the country.
 Many online retailers in Vietnam are using conversational artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots to address customer queries in real time and keep customers apprised of order updates.

600026,StarBiz,12,04/10/2023,Tech giants battling  for content to build AI,Microsoft testimony in Google antitrust case,"WASHINGTON: Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella says tech giants were competing for vast troves of content needed to train artificial intelligence (AI), and complained Google was locking up content with expensive and exclusive deals with publishers.
 Testifying in a landmark US trial against its rival Google, the first major antitrust case brought by the United States since it sued Microsoft in 1998, Nadella testified the tech giant’s efforts to build content libraries to train their large language models “reminds me of the early phases of distribution deals”.
 Distribution agreements are at the core of the US Justice Department’s antitrust fight against Google. The government said that Google, with some 90% of the search market, illegally pays US$10bil annually to smartphone makers like Apple and wireless carriers like AT&T and others to be the default search engine on their devices.
 The clout in search makes Google a heavy hitter in the lucrative advertising market, boosting its profits.
 Nadella said building AI took computing power, or servers, and data to train the software. On servers, he said: “No problem, we are happy to put in the dollars.”
 But without naming Google, he said it was “problematic” if other companies locked up exclusive deals with big content makers.
 “When I am meeting with publishers now, they say Google’s going to write this cheque and it’s exclusive, and you have to match it,” he said.
 Nadella also testified that Microsoft had sought to make its Bing search engine the default on Apple smartphones but was rebuffed.
 John Schmidtlein, Google’s lead lawyer, pressed Nadella on occasions when Microsoft did win default status on computers and mobile phones, but users still bypassed Bing and continued to use Google by a wide margin.
 Schmidtlein argued that Microsoft had made a series of strategic errors that led to Bing’s inability to grab a foothold, including a failure to invest in servers or engineers to improve Bing and a failure to see the mobile revolution.
 Schmidtlein also said Microsoft’s success in becoming the default, on some Verizon phones in 2008, and BlackBerry and Nokia in 2011, ended with the same result – users bypassed Bing and did the vast majority of their searches on Google.
 On laptops, most of which use Microsoft operating systems, Bing is the default search engine and has a market share below 20%, Nadella acknowledged.
 “You get up in the morning and you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” he added in a reference to Google’s dominance in search.
 Judge Amit Mehta, who will decide the case being tried in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asked Nadella why Apple would switch to Bing given the Microsoft product’s lower quality.
 The question suggests Google’s argument, that it is dominant because of its quality and not because of illegal activity, has caught the judge’s interest.
 Nadella became chief executive officer of Microsoft in 2014, long after the tech giant faced its own federal antitrust lawsuit. 
 That court fight, which ended in a 2001 settlement, forced Microsoft to end some business practices and opened the door to companies like Google.
 As Google, which was founded in 1998, became an industry leading search engine, the two became bitter rivals. 
 Both have browsers, search engines, email services and a host of other overlaps. They became rivals in AI more recently, with Microsoft investing heavily in OpenAI and Google building the Bard AI chatbot among other investments. — Reuters",washington microsoft chief executive satya nadella tech giant vast trove content artificial intelligence google locking content expensive exclusive deal publisher landmark trial rival google major antitrust united microsoft nadella tech giant effort content library language model phase distribution deal distribution agreement justice department antitrust fight google government search market smartphone maker apple wireless carrier search engine device search google heavy hitter lucrative advertising market profit building power server data train software server happy dollar google problematic company exclusive deal content maker publisher write cheque exclusive match nadella microsoft search engine default apple smartphones john schmidtlein google lead lawyer nadella occasion default status computer phone user google wide margin schmidtlein microsoft series strategic error inability grab failure invest server engineer failure mobile revolution schmidtlein microsoft success default verizon phone nokia result user vast majority search laptop microsoft system default search engine market share morning brush search google reference google dominance search judge amit mehta decide district court district columbia nadella apple switch microsoft product lower quality question argument dominant quality illegal activity judge nadella chief executive officer microsoft tech giant federal antitrust lawsuit court settlement microsoft business practice door company google industry search engine bitter rival browser engine service host rival microsoft openai google bard chatbot investment reuters,"[(2, 0.99586296)]",2

599294,StarBiz,6,02/10/2023,"GRM to set up four AI centres in M’sia, S’pore",Company reiterates commitment to green energy,"KUCHING: Sarawak-based Global Resources Management Digital Solutions Sdn Bhd (GRM) is planning to set up four advanced artificial intelligence (AI) data centres in Malaysia and Singapore.
 One each of the data centres will be located in Sarawak and Singapore and two in Peninsular Malaysia.
 GRM executive director Slyvester Wong said the data centres will cater for high-computing AI servers with AI-ready high-capacity workload.
 “At the heart of these AI centres is our commitment to green energy,” he said during the “Digital Transformation through Accelerated Application” seminar here recently.
 Sarawak Premier Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, who opened the seminar, said the state authorities would study the possibility to supply green energy to power the proposed four Tier-4 AI data centres.
 Johari said with Sarawak’s huge hydropower potential, the state could produce more than 20,000 megawatt (MW) of green power by constructing more dams, without having to submerge large portions of landmass.
 This, he said, could be done through cascading dams which have been built in Europe, Tasmania and Nordic countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland.
 State-owned Sarawak Energy Bhd currently owns and operates the hydroelectric dams in Bakun (2,400MW), Murum (944MW) and Batang Ai (108MW). 
 The company is currently building the Baleh dam (1,285MW), which is expected to come on stream in 2028.  
 Wong said GRM plans to lay two subsea fibre optic cables to connect Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
 He said the South-East Asia Hainan-Hongkong Express Cable System (SEA-H2x) would be completed by end-2024 and would link Sarawak to two major Internet hubs in the world – Singapore and Hong Kong.
 “This is a significant step forward in enhancing Sarawak’s digital connection,” added Wong. 
 SEA-H2X is a submarine cable connecting Hong Kong, Hainan, the Philippines, Thailand, Borneo Island and Singapore, with options to extend to Vietnam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia.
 The SEA-H2X cable system, according to media reports, consists of at least eight fibre pairs between Hong Kong and Singapore, with a design capacity of 160 tbps (terabits per second) to meet the growing bandwidth requirement in the region. 
 Terabits represents one trillion bits and per second which indicates the rate at which data is transmitted.
 The SEA-H2X consortium comprises China Moble International Ltd, China Unicom Global, Converage Information and Communications Technology Solutions Inc and PPTEL Sea H2X  Sdn Bhd.
 Wong said GRM’s seasoned technical team, backed by reliable strategic partners, will position the company to drive Sarawak’s digital transformation.
 Sarawak Digital Transformation under Post-Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030 is to adopt and utilise digital technology to change the way services are delivered and businesses are conducted as well as to boost efficiency and productivity in the state’s economic sector.
  Efforts under this enabler that will support Sarawak’s aspiration towards becoming a developed state include digitalising the private sector economy through technologies such as big data, Internet of Things, blockchain and enhancing digitalisation of government service delivery and infrastructure to drive ease of doing business.

 Some companies are exploring how generative AI – a form of artificial intelligence trained to create new outputs based on existing dataset – can help in their operations. Accenture Plc’s Philip­­pine unit is studying the use of AI-powered “co-pilots” as “advisers” for call-­centre agents and to help their coders understand and create codes.
 “Our clients are very much starting to explore generative AI, so it’s important that the industry goes in lockstep with this,” Arvin Yanson, managing director of Accenture Philippines’ innovation hub, said in an interview on the summit’s sidelines.
 Even with this push, humans will remain important in outsourcing companies’ processes, given that the technology is still in its infancy and still has challenges with accuracy and more complex tasks, according to Yanson.
 “It is prudent to actually ensure that a human is still kept in the loop to either review, approve or modify what the generative AI is saying,” Yanson said.
 The government is also planning to set up an AI research centre where it will hire scientists to help smaller businesses explore and have access to new technology, Trade Secretary Alfredo Pas­cual said at the same event.
 Madrid said the prospects for the outsourcing sector remain bright despite the challenges posed by AI. 
 This year, the industry expects to achieve 23% of the 1.1 million jobs and a fifth of the US$29.5bil (RM138.7bil) additional revenue that it is targeting by 2028.
 “Artificial intelligence plus our emotional intelligence will be a very potent combination,” Madrid said. — Bloomberg",hotel ballroom stakeholder largest provider service main trade leader bold call embrace generative fear south east asian nation tap technology propel sector height jack madrid president business ciation philippine industry summit delegate train station late thursday speed rest philippine disruption bot centre job technology crucial philippine sector account economic output top source dollar company generative form artificial intelligence create output operation philip pine unit pilot adviser centre agent coder create code client generative industry lockstep yanson director accenture innovation hub interview summit sideline push human company technology infancy accuracy complex task yanson prudent human loop review generative yanson government planning centre hire scientist business access technology trade secretary pa cual event madrid prospect sector bright challenge industry job additional revenue artificial intelligence emotional intelligence potent combination madrid,"[(2, 0.992883)]",2
598300,StarBiz,12,29/09/2023,"Meta putting AI in digital assistants, smart glasses",Firm also unveils latest Quest virtual reality headset,"NEW YORK: Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg says the tech giant is putting artificial intelligence (AI) into digital assistants and smart glasses as it seeks to gain lost ground in the AI race.
 Zuckerberg made his announcements at the Connect developers conference at Meta’s headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company’s main annual product event.
 “Advances in AI allow us to create different (applications) and personas that help us accomplish different things,” Zuckerberg said as he kicked off the gathering.
 “And smart glasses are going to eventually allow us to bring all of this together into a stylish form factor that we can wear.”
 Smart glasses are one of the many ways that tech companies have tried to move beyond the smartphone as a user-friendly device, but so far with little success.
 The second-generation Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses made in a partnership with EssilorLuxottica will have a starting price of US$299 when they hit the market on Oct 17.
 The smart glasses also add the ability for users to stream what they are seeing in real time, Zuckerberg said.
 “Smart glasses are the ideal form factor for you to let AI assistants see what you’re seeing and hear what you’re hearing.”
 Meta also introduced 28 AI characters that people can message on WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram with “personalities” based on celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and YouTube star MrBeast.
 Zuckerberg demonstrated an interaction with one such AI from the stage in a type-written chat, promising that the new bots would soon be voiced.
 “This is our first effort at training a bunch of AI that are a bit more fun,” Zuckerberg said.
 “But look, this is early stuff and these still have a lot of limitations, which you will see when you use them.”
 The event was the first in-person edition of Connect since 2019, before the pandemic, and announcements on generative AI were widely expected.
 Meta has taken a much more cautious approach than its rivals Microsoft, OpenAI and Google to push out AI products, prioritising small steps and making its in-house models available to developers and researchers.
 Meta also unveiled the latest version of its Quest virtual reality headset with richer graphics, improved audio and the ability for a wearer to see what is around them without taking the gear off, a demonstration for AFP showed.
 “This is going to be a big game changer and a big capacity improvement for these headsets,” Zuckerberg told developers gathered in a Meta headquarters courtyard.
 Quest 3 headsets are priced starting at US$499 and will begin shipping on Oct 10, according to Meta.
 This is substantially cheaper than Apple’s Vision Pro, which will cost a hefty US$3,499 when it is available early next year, in the United States only.
 The Quest 3 “is going to be the best value on the market for a long time to come,” said Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, to laughter from the audience.

598302,StarBiz,12,29/09/2023,AI chip crunch: Startups vie for Nvidia’s vital component,,"SAN FRANCISCO: The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is fully underway, but soaring demand for its most crucial component has startups scratching their heads on how they can deliver on AI’s promise.
 Generative AI’s lifeblood is a book-sized semiconductor known as the graphics processing unit (GPU) – built by one company, Nvidia.
 Nvidia chief executive officer and founder Jensen Huang made a wild bet years ago that the world would soon clamor for a powerful chip usually used for making video games, but that could build AI as well.
 No company working with the generative AI models that fuel today’s frenzy can get off the ground without Nvidia’s singular product: the latest model is the H100 and its accompanying software.
 That painful reality is one that Amazon, Intel, AMD and others are scrambling to fix with their own alternatives, but those attempts could take years.
 And with the biggest tech companies throwing all their financial might into generative AI, the smaller fish must go on the hunt to secure Nvidia’s holy grail.
 “Around the world, it is becoming very hard to get thousands of GPUs because all these big companies are putting in billions of dollars, stockpiling GPUs,” said Fangbo Tao, co-founder of Mindverse.AI, a Singapore-based startup.
 “There’s not a lot of GPUs around,” he said.
 Tao spoke to AFP at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, where AI startups jostled to make their pitches to Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists (VC).
 ChatGPT took the world by storm just as Silicon Valley was caught in a nasty hangover from the pandemic when investors threw money at startups, convinced that life had gone irreversibly online.
 That turned out to be far-fetched, and the US tech scene entered a downturn with rounds of layoffs and VC money dried up.
 Thanks to AI, some of the old mojo is back, and anyone with those two letters on their resume will likely see a red carpet rolled out on the legendary Sand Hill Road, home to Silicon Valley’s most storied investors.
 But as the startups walk away with their VC cash, the money in their pockets will be quickly forked out to Nvidia for GPUs either directly or through providers to bring their AI dreams to execution.
 “We call on a lot of the big cloud providers (Microsoft, AWS and Google), and they all tell us even they are having trouble getting supplies,” said Laurent Daudet, chief executive officer of AI startup LightOn.
 The problem is most acute for companies involved in training generative AI models, which requires that power hungry GPUs work at peak capacity to process troves of data ingested from the Internet. — AFP",san francisco artificial intelligence revolution demand crucial component startup head generative lifeblood book semiconductor graphic unit gpu company nvidia chief executive officer founder jensen huang wild bet clamor powerful chip video game company generative model ground singular product model software painful reality intel amd alternative attempt biggest tech company financial generative fish hunt secure nvidia holy hard thousand gpus company billion dollar gpus fangbo tao founder mindverse singapore startup lot gpus tao afp techcrunch disrupt conference san francisco startup pitch silicon valley venture capitalist chatgpt storm silicon valley nasty hangover pandemic investor money startup life online tech scene downturn round money mojo letter red carpet legendary sand hill road silicon valley investor walk cash money pocket nvidia gpus bring execution call lot cloud provider aws trouble supply daudet chief executive officer startup lighton acute company generative model power hungry gpus peak capacity process trove data internet afp,"[(0, 0.9935709)]",0
598022,StarBiz,12,28/09/2023,Giant wireless carrier to triple investment in AI,SKTelecom unveils roadmap to become global leader,"SEOUL: The chief executive officer (CEO) of SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest wireless carrier by subscription, unveils the company’s roadmap to leap forward as a global artificial intelligence (AI) firm within the next five years by expanding its business and technology based on its AI assistant service, A.
 The telecom giant’s chief Ryu Young-sang introduced the firm’s new “AI pyramid strategy” that focuses on three major areas: AI infrastructure, AI transformation and AI service.
 It is the key to realising the firm’s goal as the “global AI firm” by creating new industrial innovations, he said.
 “The AI ​​gold rush has begun. SK Telecom is trying to run most aggressively into the AI revolution. Since telecom operators have no legacy, the AI revolution is a definite opportunity for us,” the CEO said. 
 “We’ll create business models that a telecom operator can do to be competitive in the market.”
 For this, the telecom company plans to triple its investment in AI-related business from 12% from in 2019 to 33% over the next five years to 2028 and achieve sales of more than 25 trillion won (US$18.5bil), while it logged some 17 trillion won in sales last year.
 “Disruptive innovation triggered by generative AI has already created new values in all areas of industry, our society and life. 
 “We will accelerate our execution ability and continue to expand investment in AI-related resources based on the strategy centred around self-reliance and cooperation,” Ryu said.
 As the AI ​​market is in full swing, data centre supply shortages, excessive power useage and rapid increases in carbon emissions have emerged as new social problems. 
 SK Telecom will introduce energy-saving solutions to solve the issues while making a foray into the global market. It is also planning to double the size of its domestic data centres by 2030, Ryu said.
 Sapeon Korea, a global AI semiconductor company that spun out from the telecom giant last year, will launch the next-generation inference AI chip, X330, by the end of this year. 
 It has the advantages of approximately twice the computational performance and 1.3 times the power efficiency compared to its competitors.
 To secure competitiveness in the multi- large language model sector, it will strengthen cooperation with major Big Tech firms such as OpenAI.
 SK Telecom looks to expand AI services to its existing telecommunications and IPTV services to reduce costs by more than 20% to 30% in the mid to long term, as well as to non-telecom sectors, including Urban Air Mobility, health care and media.
 At Tuesday’s event, the CEO announced the official launch of A, which began its beta service in May last year. 
 Based on A, the company will provide an AI phone service with call summary and calendar functions, an AI sleep management tool and an AI music service that can create users’ playlists.
 Additionally, SK Telecom plans to roll out a personal AI assistant roaming service that can provide about 1.2 billion telecom users in 45 countries, based on its global alliance formed in July. 
 The South Korean telecom firm joined hands with Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, the United Arab Emirates’ e& and Singapore’s Singtel to expand AI cooperation.
 “Just as we subscribe to two to three over-the-top platforms these days, telecom users are expected to use two to three personal AI assistants within the next three years,” the SK Telecom chief said.

598220,Main,5,28/09/2023,The dark side of AI on social media,Any picture can be manipulated; experts warned against sharing photos,"PETALING JAYA: Even innocent pictures or videos shared on social media can be turned into explicit content with artificial intelligence (AI), warns civil society.
 Especially vulnerable are women and children.
 Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education (Magpie) chairman Mak Chee Kin said parents should refrain from sharing pictures or videos of their children on social media.
 He said tech-savvy, irresponsible individuals could do all sorts of things with images or videos found online.
 “In this era of AI and advanced technology, incidents of scammed or doctored images, and in some cases, voices, are happening.
 “The truth is that the more one exposes themselves to social media, the higher the risks they will encounter,” he said.
 He pointed out that even those innocently sharing images or videos of loved ones on social media could be victims of undesired consequences.
 “What was supposed to be a fun and happy thing could lead to unforeseen problems,” Mak added.
 Parent Action Group for Education chairman Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim said parents should prepare their children to be mentally strong and smart enough to face these technological challenges.
 “What we can do is take care of our own children and build their confidence and mental strength to overcome such situations.
 “Though it is easier said than done, it is best to talk about it with the children and strengthen their minds,” she said.
 When asked, Noor Azimah agreed that the culture of oversharing online is partly to blame, as children are too eager to share without realising the consequences.
 Persatuan Sahabat Wanita Selangor executive director Irene Xavier also said women should be cautioned to be wary of uploading pictures of themselves and their families.
 “We have cases of women who uploaded pictures of themselves in revealing positions for their boyfriends, and when the relationship goes sour, these pictures have been abused,” she said.
 She added that women should think hard before posting photographs of themselves.
 In September, a Melaka lawmaker highlighted how a private Telegram group uploaded hundreds of doctored and obscene pictures of innocent victims, comprising female executives, housewives and even young men.
 Kota Laksamana assemblyman Low Chee Leong said the doctored image included a 65-year-old grandmother wearing a bikini.
 Earlier this year, Mstar also highlighted how certain quarters used AI to superimpose women’s pictures in the nude.
 It quoted user @magmalaya who made a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) cautioning women against posting too much on social media due to this.
 The comment section of the post was also filled with users discussing how some were conducting “business” by selling the images.
 Recently, in Spain, over 20 girls in a town came forward as victims of AI-generated nude images, which were created by feeding an AI app with fully clothed pictures of themselves on social media.
 Some of the girls had received demands for payment from the creators of these images, or their pictures would be uploaded to adult websites.
 MCA Public Services and Complaints Department head Datuk Seri Michael Chong said devious individuals would usually conduct background checks on those they wanted to target through deep fakes.
 Chong said some of the cases he handled were between boyfriends and girlfriends and married partners who had parted ways.
 “There are cases of perpetrators superimposing images of people in obscene acts, destroying their reputation, and even extorting them for money.
 “If you are a victim, don’t keep it to yourselves. Speak to those around you or to non-governmental organisations that have expertise in dealing with such matters.
 “From there, weigh your options and decide what you want to do next,” he said, adding that this included lodging police reports.",jaya innocent picture social medium explicit content artificial intelligence civil society vulnerable woman child melaka action parent education magpie chairman mak chee parent picture video child social medium tech savvy irresponsible individual sort image online era technology incident doctored image voice truth social medium risk image social medium victim undesired consequence fun happy lead unforeseen mak parent action education chairman noor azimah rahim parent prepare child strong smart technological challenge child confidence mental strength overcome situation talk child noor azimah culture child eager share consequence persatuan sahabat wanita selangor executive director irene xavier woman wary uploading picture family woman picture position relationship sour picture woman hard photograph september melaka lawmaker private telegram hundred obscene picture innocent victim female executive housewife laksamana assemblyman low chee leong image bikini mstar quarter superimpose woman picture user post twitter woman social medium comment post user business selling image girl town victim nude image app picture social medium girl demand payment creator picture uploaded adult website public service complaint department head seri michael devious individual background check deep fake boyfriend girlfriend married partner perpetrator image people act reputation money victim governmental organisation matter option lodging police report,"[(2, 0.457399), (6, 0.53872114)]",6
597796,StarBiz,12,27/09/2023,Amazon to invest  in AI startup Anthropic,Venture will be largest deal directly related to AWS,"SAN FRANCISCO: Amazon.com Inc will invest as much as US$4bil in Anthropic, securing a crucial partner in its effort to become a major player in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and offering a vote of confidence in the hot startup.
 As part of the deal, Anthropic will move most of its software to Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centres, and use the cloud computing company’s homegrown chips to train the models it uses to power chatbots and other applications. 
 Besides getting access to Amazon’s computing power, Anthropic will gain a financial infusion that will help it pay the huge costs required to train and run massive AI models.
 AWS chief executive officer (CEO) Adam Selipsky said in an interview on Bloomberg Television that the company’s initial investment in Anthropic is US$1.25bil. 
 Amazon will have a minority position in the startup, the companies said in a statement on Monday.
 Amazon shares rose 1.6% to US$131.21 in New York.
 The eCommerce and cloud computing giant has long taken stakes in partners in areas it deems a priority, including cargo airlines, a grocery distributor and an electric truck manufacturer. 
 But if the investment in Anthropic lands anywhere near US$4bil, it would represent the largest known piece of corporate dealmaking directly related to AWS. 
 The unit has tended to build its own products rather than relying on technology or businesses purchased from others, making relatively modest acquisitions in a market of hype-fuelled, billion-dollar valuations. 
 Amazon said its engineers, including those who work outside of AWS, will have access to Anthropic’s models.
 AWS is the world’s largest seller of on-demand computing power and data storage. 
 But it has been widely seen as a laggard in the emerging field of computer models trained to generate text, images and other content because it has lacked both a hit product and a high-profile exclusive partner in the arena. 
 ChatGPT creator OpenAI runs its software on Microsoft Corp’s data centres, a partnership based on a US$13bil investment that has sparked a renewal for Amazon’s Seattle-area neighbour.
 “Amazon’s US$4bil investment in AI startup Anthropic may not move the financial needle for its cloud services unit in the near term, but it shows that it’s taking Microsoft’s perceived AI leadership seriously,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal wrote in a note Monday.
 Amazon executives have said that it’s early days for so-called generative AI and that more than 100,000 customers have used the company’s machine-learning tools to date. 
 Anthropic’s foundational model, called Claude, was already available as part of an Amazon service called Bedrock, still in early release, that makes both Amazon and third-party models available to its customers.
 “We have tremendous respect for Anthropic’s team and foundation models and believe we can help improve many customer experiences, short and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.
 Founded by OpenAI veterans, Anthropic has raised more than US$1bil to date with a pitch to make a safer kind of chatbot for such tasks as summarising, searching, answering questions and coding. 
 The company’s backers include Alphabet Inc’s Google, which invested almost US$400mil in Anthropic, Bloomberg reported in February. 
 Google is also an AWS cloud rival and builder of models used in generative AI.
 “By significantly expanding our partnership, we can unlock new possibilities for organisations of all sizes as they deploy Anthropic’s safe, state-of-the-art AI systems together with AWS’s leading cloud technology,” Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei said.
 The deal also represents a milestone moment for Amazon’s in-house chipmaking effort, which includes processors called Trainium and Inferentia that are designed to power machine-learning applications. 
 Most cutting-edge AI applications rely on pricey chips built by Nvidia Corp that can be hard to come by. 
 Anthropic will use AWS chips to build and train future foundational models, the companies said.
 Selipsky said there was “huge demand” for the range of chips that power generative AI and that AWS had been ramping up the supply chain for the chips it designs. — Bloomberg",san francisco amazon bil anthropic crucial partner effort major player generative artificial intelligence vote confidence hot startup deal move software amazon web service data centre company homegrown chip model power chatbots application access power anthropic gain financial infusion pay huge cost massive model chief executive officer ceo adam selipsky interview bloomberg television company initial investment anthropic bil amazon minority position startup company statement amazon share york ecommerce cloud giant stake partner priority cargo airline grocery distributor electric truck manufacturer investment anthropic bil represent largest piece corporate aws unit build product technology business modest acquisition market hype dollar valuation engineer aws access anthropic model largest seller demand power data storage field computer model text image hit product profile exclusive partner arena creator openai software microsoft corp data centre partnership bil investment renewal amazon seattle neighbour amazon bil investment startup anthropic financial needle cloud service unit term microsoft leadership bloomberg intelligence analyst poonam goyal note monday executive day generative customer company machine learning tool foundational model amazon service bedrock release amazon party model customer tremendous respect anthropic team foundation model customer experience short term deeper collaboration ceo andy jassy statement openai veteran bil pitch chatbot task question company backer google mil anthropic bloomberg february google aws rival builder model partnership unlock possibility organisation deploy anthropic safe art system cloud technology anthropic founder ceo dario amodei deal moment amazon house effort processor trainium inferentia power machine learning application edge application pricey chip corp hard anthropic aws chip train future foundational model company huge demand range chip power generative supply chain chip bloomberg,"[(3, 0.996399)]",3

 SOBA LAB, which is an abbreviation of “Learn, Aspire, Build”, assists SMEs on their entrepreneurial journey through talks and discussions by business leaders and experts.
 In addition to workforce transformation and enhancing operational efficiency, rapid adoption of technology can also lead to improved cost optimisation, enriched customer experiences, and increased engagement, according to speakers at the event attended by more than 100 participants.
 RHB Bank Bhd SME banking head Yip How Nang stressed the importance of integrating human resources into digitalisation initiatives.
 “Digital technologies offer significant efficiencies, but without the right mindset for change, organisational weaknesses can be magnified. Businesses need a well-defined strategy before making significant investments, with human resources being an integral part of the digital journey rather than a component to be replaced,” he said.
 PKT Logistics Group Sdn Bhd chief revenue officer Kuan Eu Jin encouraged SMEs to embrace AI and digitalisation, noting their better affordability and ease of access today.
 “While the impetus for digitalisation or automation often comes from external sources, SMEs should seize the opportunity to overcome internal fears or hesitations regarding increased productivity and effectiveness. AI and digitalisation are becoming more affordable, making it an ideal time for SMEs to explore their options.
 “Initiating digitalisation and automation is never too late, as long as it aligns closely with business requirements,” he said.
 OPC Resources Sdn Bhd founder and chief executive officer Eric Ooi highlighted the potential benefits of AI-driven software in connecting departments in a company to conduct comprehensive market research.
 “Currently, we have systems running without the need for a server managed by third-party operators. This approach saves costs and allows smart systems to analyse market trends and outcomes, particularly in departments dealing with large volumes of data. Small industries concerned about the burden of digitalisation can always start on a smaller scale,” he said.
 The trio were sharing their perspectives on digitalisation and AI for productivity in Malaysian SMEs. The discussion was moderated by Krystelle Ma, bureau adviser for the PCCC YES Toastmasters Club.

596158,Main,27,23/09/2023,Rights protected from AI misuse,Bollywood’s Anil Kapoor wins legal battle in landmark ruling,"New Delhi: The Delhi High Court ruled that the personality rights of Bollywood stalwart Anil Kapoor (pic) will be protected against any potential misuse of artificial intelligence (AI).
 Anil, renowned for his roles in hit films like Slumdog Millionaire, obtained an interim order against 16 defendants accused of infringing upon his personality rights, which encompass his name, likeness, image, and voice, reported Outlook India magazine on Wednesday.
 This court order prohibits the exploitation of Anil’s personality rights for commercial purposes or on social media platforms. 
 Justice Pratibha Singh also barred the use of AI tools to morph Anil’s image or use it to create GIFs for monetary gain, said Indian newspaper Business Standard on Thursday.
 The lawsuit arose after morphed videos and emojis featuring Anil’s iconic exclamation “jhakas” from the 1985 film Yudh went viral on social media. This saying, roughly translats to “awesome” or “wicked,” is now protected under the court order.
 As reported by The Hindu, Pravin Anand, Anil’s lawyer, highlighted instances of unauthorised merchandise sales and the collection of fees using Anil’s image as a motivational speaker, further emphasising the need for protection.
 Anand also pointed out that Anil’s image was morphed in a derogatory manner.
 The country’s Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology was asked to issue blocking orders against pornographic videos that used morphed images of Anil, reported Business Standard.
 After a detailed hearing, the court acknowledged Anil’s personality rights and imposed restrictions on the use of his personality rights without his permission.
 In a report by The Indian Express, the court said that technological tools such as AI now make it possible for any unauthorised user to make use of a celebrity’s persona.
 “The celebrity also enjoys the right of privacy and does not wish that his or her image, or voice, is portrayed in a dark manner as is being done on porn websites,” said the court.
 Speaking to Variety, Anil said he was very happy with the court order in his favour.
 This ruling underscores the growing importance of safeguarding celebrities’ personality rights in an era dominated by AI and digital media, setting a precedent for similar cases.
 “I think it’s very progressive and great for not only me, but for other actors also,” Anil told Variety. —  The Straits Times/ANN",delhi delhi court personality right bollywood stalwart anil kapoor pic potential misuse artificial intelligence anil role film slumdog millionaire interim defendant personality right encompass likeness image voice outlook india magazine wednesday court exploitation anil personality right commercial purpose social medium platform justice pratibha singh tool anil image create gifs monetary gain indian newspaper business standard thursday lawsuit video anil iconic exclamation jhakas film yudh viral social medium translats protected court hindu pravin anand lawyer instance unauthorised merchandise sale collection fee image motivational speaker protection anand anil image derogatory manner country union ministry electronics technology issue pornographic video image business standard hearing court anil personality right restriction personality right permission report indian express court technological tool unauthorised user celebrity celebrity privacy image voice dark manner porn website court variety anil happy court underscore celebrity personality right era digital medium precedent progressive actor told variety strait time,"[(2, 0.9937195)]",2
594474,StarBiz,6,18/09/2023,Poll: Malaysians optimistic AI will positively transform their careers,,"PETALING JAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more common in the workplace with LinkedIn noting seven out of 10 Malaysian professionals believe it will significantly change the way they work in the near future. 
 Generative AI innovations are prompting professionals to adapt to a more advanced and new way of working in the country, the social media platform said its research found. 
 However, the sheer rate of change is proven to bring mixed feelings to Malaysian professionals about the development of AI regarding their workplace. 
 While many are intrigued by the adoption of AI in their workplace, there is still a large majority of people who are still concerned about this fast-paced developing technology. 
 LinkedIn found 52% of working professionals in the country believe their colleagues are better versed in AI than they are, creating a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm for the future. 
 LinkedIn’s research found there was a 21 times global increase in English-language jobs mentioning new generative AI, demonstrating that AI could be an important step for those looking to develop their career. 
 “Although there may be challenges to AI adoption, Malaysians are optimistic that AI will positively transform their careers,” said LinkedIn in a statement.  
 Most Malaysian professionals are excited about the ability of AI to provide them with more work-life balance and allow them to do more high-value work to better showcase their abilities. 
 Statistics also show that 47% Malaysian professionals believe AI can contribute to more equitable career opportunities in the local workforce, while 50% believe AI can create even more job opportunities outside of larger cities. 
 This is as professionals can actively upskill their abilities in AI and leverage on AI’s resources to work remotely. 
 LinkedIn said professionals in Malaysia are of the opinion that AI will not only increase their access to the knowledge and skill sets required for their jobs, but will also highlight the unrivalled importance of human skills in advancing their careers. 
 LinkedIn Asean country manager for Malaysia and head of growth markets, Rohit Kalsy, said it is encouraging to see people focus on the positives that AI can bring to their working lives.

594426,StarBiz,7,18/09/2023,Pilot project set to explore AI-powered branding,,"SINGAPORE: IPG Mediabrands has announced a partnership with Google Cloud to develop a suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) powered applications for brands.
 Under the terms of the partnership IPG Mediabrands would develop two pilot platforms, branded content generation (BrandVoice AI) and audience and research Insights (BrandPortrait AI).
 The BrandVoice AI pilot would use Google Cloud’s latest generative AI technology to codify the essence of brands so that written and image-based content can be ideated, briefed, and drafted in an automated, safe, and on-brand manner.
 The BrandPortrait pilot would use the advanced conversational capabilities of Google’s large language models to provide IPG Mediabrands strategists and planners with the ability to generate and summarise proprietary research and audience data.
 All content would be approved by the brands – IPG Mediabrands clients – before being utilised by the AI pilot platforms.
 The IPG Mediabrands Data and Technology Innovation department has been working exclusively on AI-based solutions for nearly four years, seeing AI as the ideal technology to augment the people and capabilities of IPG Mediabrands agencies.
 With deep practical expertise in AI for optimisation problems, as well as identity and bias removal and identification, the innovation team first experimented with generative AI technologies several years ago. Since then, the team has built applications and prototypes that generate ad copy, imagery, reporting insights and SEO content, all proven out in real-world campaign scenarios.
 SEO content is any content created with the goal of attracting search engine traffic.
 Having achieved success with its use of AI already, IPG Mediabrands would now use the power of Google Cloud’s generative AI support in Vertex AI, specifically the PaLM 2 language model, to take its solutions to the next level.
 Vertex AI  is a machine learning (ML) platform that lets a person train and deploy ML models and AI applications. PaLM 2 is a language model that Google is deploying to bring AI capabilities to all of its products, including Gmail, Google Docs and Bard.
 Eileen Kiernan, global CEO, IPG Mediabrands in a statement said: “We are excited to partner with Google Cloud to develop this new platform.
 “Not only does this partnership let us leverage market leading technology, but also we are aligned to Google’s responsible approach on data governance which ensures our clients information is well protected.
 “We know that the potential of this technology is just scratching the surface, but we believe that by placing brands at the centre of AI solutions, we get to a place where the true potential can be unlocked for brands and the industry overall.”
 Google Cloud managing director, partnerships, Manvinder Singh said: “IPG Mediabrands will help to empower brands in new ways with their AI-based platform.
 “The ability to quickly and effectively create content that is both engaging and aligned with brand values has the potential to help companies save money and more deeply connect with customers.”",ipg mediabrands partnership google cloud suite generative artificial intelligence application brand term partnership ipg mediabrands pilot platform content generation brandvoice audience insight brandvoice pilot google generative technology codify essence brand image content safe brand manner brandportrait pilot conversational capability language model ipg mediabrands planner ability summarise proprietary audience data content brand ipg mediabrands client utilised pilot platform mediabrands data technology innovation department solution ideal technology augment people capability mediabrands agency practical expertise optimisation identity bias removal identification innovation team generative technology team application prototype copy imagery reporting insight content real campaign scenario content content goal search engine traffic success ipg power google cloud generative support vertex palm language model solution vertex machine learning platform person deploy model application palm language model google bring capability product gmail google doc bard eileen kiernan global ceo ipg mediabrands statement partner google cloud platform partnership leverage market technology responsible approach data governance client potential technology surface brand centre solution true potential unlocked brand industry cloud director partnership singh ipg mediabrands brand platform ability create content brand value potential company money deeply connect customer,"[(2, 0.99493736)]",2
593860,StarEdu,7,17/09/2023,How to work with AI,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) won’t take your job, economist Richard Baldwin told the World Economic Forum’s Growth Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, recently, but his next sentence wasn’t so reassuring – it’s somebody using AI who will take your job. He’s right, of course, at least for the time being. Now that generative AI, such as ChatGPT, can perform many intellectual tasks to a considerable level of speed and competency, it is no wonder that human jobs are considered at risk. 
 However, AI is not infallible – just ask lawyer Peter LoDuca, who learned this the hard way when he was representing a client who was suing Avianca Airlines in a New York federal court, claiming injuries from being hit by a cart during a 2019 flight.
 LoDuca decided to use ChatGPT to help him with his legal research and ended up citing eight prior cases, all of which were fabricated by the software. This ended up being not only embarrassing, but also highly damaging for the case.
 This phenomenon, in which generative AI produces what appears to be factual and relevant information that is totally confabulated, is known as “hallucination”. AI researchers are still working on eliminating this.
 So, how can we use AI to extend and enhance our capabilities, while ensuring that we do not fall prey to its shortcomings? Here are some suggestions:
 > Know yourself In the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) age of AI, it is an existential necessity to differentiate human output from a machine’s, while remaining anchored and motivated. For us to add authentic value, we need to know who we are, what our purpose is, and how we wish to mobilise this purpose to make a positive impact on the world. 
 > Don’t share private or confidential informationSharing privileged information related to your business or that of your clients with the generative AI can be considered a serious misconduct as all your input will become part of the system’s training content.
 > Provide effective promptsWhen using generative AI to help you with work projects or school assignments, it is important to be as clear, direct and specific as possible. 
 It helps to provide the context and constraints of your enquiry, and to give examples of what you wish to receive. Using complete sentences and breaking down complex issues will aid AI in providing you with a more coherent answer.
 > Fact-check No matter how convincing the AI output is, check the produced content before sharing or using it as a basis for decision-making. Remember, AI can hallucinate.
 > Do not copy and paste You should use AI to inspire rather than replace you. Rewrite what you wish to adopt using your own words.
 > Be transparent If some work, or part thereof, is entirely produced by AI, mention that clearly to those assessing or using your work. They will appreciate your professionalism.
 > Provide value Whether you’re a student being graded for your work or an employee being compensated, your teacher or supervisor would want to see that you’re contributing value that is distinctive from what AI is capable of.> Use polite language The language we adopt when using AI will be used to train the system and we want the system to be trained positively. It is also nice to keep the “conversation” professional when providing prompts.
 > Stay out of harm’s way 
 Avoid using the AI to create content that is inappropriate, harmful or offensive even if you are just experimenting. Our actions have legal and moral implications.
 > Be proud of your workIf the work you are producing is delivered without any help from AI, write a declaration indicating that the work is done entirely by a human without the use of AI. 
 Our journey with AI is in its infancy, and the topic of working safely and effectively with this powerful new tool will continue to evolve. It pays to stay informed, as new guidelines are being developed and made available, but the suggestions above are a good place to start, at least for now.

593308,StarBiz,9,15/09/2023,S’pore investor GIC to tread carefully around AI,,"SINGAPORE: State investor GIC is treading carefully around the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI), but will stay focused on investment opportunities in companies that may benefit the most from the new technology.
 Chief executive Lim Chow Kiat said that there is always some hype around new and transformative technologies, and AI is no exception.
 He told the Milken Institute’s 10th Asia Summit at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore on Wednesday: “AI is, in our view, very important and has huge potential for transformation of all industries and everything we do. But the technology is still at an early stage in terms of its translation into business models and outcomes.
 “So, in that sense, we are a bit wary of some of the kind of short-term valuations in some of the early-stage start-ups, some of the new models.
 “We would be very cautious in deploying capital given the valuations and the lack of a real business model.”
 Investors worldwide are rushing to invest in the next big opportunity in AI since the launch of chatbot ChatGPT late last year.
 More recently, chipmaker Nvidia reported blockbuster financial results that sent its share price rallying by more than 100% in a matter of days.
 However, experts have warned investors against chasing the AI boom, advising them to invest only in companies that have credible strategies.
 Lim said there are certain companies or certain providers of AI technology and services that are in good stead. But companies like Internet platforms that host those AI services and products on their websites may benefit more.
 “Typically, they are not a one-act wonder. They have other businesses, and they already have customers. Those are interesting opportunities,” he added.
 He noted that GIC is focused on where the value will be captured as AI technology develops and is deployed. 
 “So, for investors, it’s quite important not to get caught in the front end of that revenue generation but look through the value chain and see where you know it actually is being captured.”
 Beyond AI, Lim said GIC sees long-term opportunities in infrastructure investments, especially those in energy transition and digitalisation.
 He also spoke about GIC’s China investment strategy at the conference.
 He said the company is “doubling down” on some sectors in China, while it remains cognisant of the difficult period the world’s second-largest economy is going through.
 “China is facing a very complex set of issues,” he said, referring to the decline in the property sector and high youth unemployment. — The Straits Times/ANN",investor gic artificial intelligence stay investment opportunity company technology chief executive lim chow hype transformative technology exception institute asia summit season hotel singapore wednesday view huge potential transformation industry technology stage term translation business model bit wary short term valuation start model cautious capital valuation real business model investor invest opportunity launch chatbot chatgpt late chipmaker nvidia financial share price matter day expert investor boom invest company credible strategy company provider technology service stead company platform host service product business customer opportunity captured technology deployed investor front revenue generation chain lim gic term opportunity investment energy transition digitalisation gic china investment strategy conference company sector cognisant difficult period largest economy china complex set issue decline property sector youth unemployment time,"[(6, 0.9923838)]",6
593330,StarBiz,12,15/09/2023,OpenAI launches office in Dublin with numerous job listings,,"DUBLIN: Artificial intelligence (AI) leader OpenAI is opening an office in Dublin, the Microsoft-backed company has announced.
 It is the company’s third office.
 Its headquarters are in San Francisco and it announced it was opening a London office in June.
 The Dublin office is starting small with three open jobs.
 These include an international payroll specialist, a business role and an Ireland policy and partnerships lead.
 OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon, however, said the company intends to open more roles in the near future.
 The Dublin office will not be the company’s European headquarters and there will not be an executive running the office, at least not yet, Kwon said.
 “We like to grow deliberately and not too rapidly. This is because we want to make sure that the culture of the company is established first in new offices before we scale up,” Kwon told Reuters.
 In opening a Dublin office, OpenAI is following a well-established American tech company strategy.
 In addition to access to a talent pool already familiar with the culture of companies like Meta and Google, Ireland is a good place to engage with Europe from a regulatory and business development standpoint, Kwon said.
 Tax implications did not play a role in the decision, as OpenAI is not profitable, Kwon said.
 OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the second fastest-growing app in history, after Meta’s Threads app.
 ChatGPT is an AI tool that can answer questions, tell stories, produce essays and even write code. The chatbot is so sophisticated that people are suddenly starting to see the true potential of AI and how, for better or for worse, it could define humanity’s future.

591986,Lifestyle,5,11/09/2023,"Drones, AI and goats",Explore the playbook of innovative approaches reshaping wildfire prevention and control in a rapidly changing world.,"AS the planet continues to warm, so does the list of countries impacted by wildfires.
 Turkey, Greece, and Spain have all dealt with blazes this year, and last month’s wildfire in Hawaii killed at least 115 people and razed the town of Lahaina.
 Canada is in the throes of a historic wildfire season, with more than 15 million hectares burned. Officials there are scrutinising the limits of traditional firefighting tactics.
 In Europe, the fastest-warming continent due to climate change, firefighters are exploring new ways to battle monster blazes. Emergency and disaster management crews are deploying drones that can detect fires earlier and are even reviving traditional practices such as using sheep and goats to graze the grass.
 Here are some of the more innovative wildfire solutions:
 Drone defence
 Drones are becoming ubiquitous on the front line.
 Domingos Xavier Viegas, a professor at Coimbra University in Portugal who specialises in wildland fire behaviour, says departments across Europe are using drone technology to map vegetation, identify high-risk areas, track wildfires, collect data, and deliver last-mile water deposits during wildfires.
 Larger drones, some of them amphibious, are also being developed to act as aerial tankers or hose bearers. These firefighting robots can spray water and fire-retardant chemicals over longer distances and larger areas.
 This can also save the lives of firefighters who otherwise have to get “so close to the fires”, says Kenneth Geipel, founder of Danish drone company Robotto Co.Geipel started Robotto in 2019 after seeing the devastation left by record wildfires in Sweden, Greece, and California a year earlier.
 He felt firefighters lacked the data needed to map and tackle blazes at the earliest stages.
 While satellite imagery comes with delays, drones can, in real time, identify smoke or heat signatures, warn fire control authorities, and calculate the position, size, and intensity of a blaze, Geipel says.
 Artificial intelligence
 All of this new information requires more data processing. Drone sensors capture more data than is humanly possible to process in real time without using AI tools, Geipel says.
 In 2022, the World Economic Forum launched an AI and machine learning initiative called FireAId. The pilot project, started in Turkey in the wake of the country’s worst-ever wildfires in 2021, showed these tools can reduce response time and risk to firefighters.Training in 3D
 Training regimens for firefighters are also getting more high-tech and collaborative as departments in different countries compare best practices.
 In Catalonia, the Pau Costa Foundation has created a three-dimensional system that allows trainees and fire teams to run through emergency wildfire scenarios.
 This so-called “digital sandbox” helps students visualise the behaviour of a forest fire and practice fire-management strategies, preparation that can be particularly helpful for firefighters in northern European countries.
 “It’s something that major cosmopolitan cities like London have never experienced before,” says Sami Goldbrom, a group commander at the London Fire Brigade (LFB).
 “But it looks likely that we’re going to be experiencing them for the foreseeable future.”
 England saw its worst wildfire season last year; July 19, 2022, was LFB’s busiest day since World War II. The LFB has since set up training connections with Australia, Greece, and Spain.
 Vegetation-clearing robots
 The best way to tackle wildfires is to prevent them in the first place. That’s why selective culling of trees and smaller plants is an important aspect of reducing wildfire risk.
 Enter vegetation-clearing robots, which can remove potential wildfire fodder. Such devices are being developed and will work alongside drones, Viegas says.
 The drones map out the high-risk areas from above, and the mechanical foot soldiers weed out vegetation in those patches.
 Fire Flocks
 Until vegetation-clearing robots become more commercially viable, some fire-management bodies are relying on an age-old pastoral technique: inviting sheep and goats to do the same job.In Catalonia, so-called Fire Flocks – sheep or goats that graze on forest floors to clean up vegetation – are making a comeback.
 A project to revive this tradition was initiated in 2016, starting with a small pilot of just 48 hectares in the Baix Emporda region of Catalonia.
 By 2022, it had expanded to 651 hectares.
 Catalonia is one of the few places on the planet where fire prevention measures have reversed an increase in blazes, according to Marc Castellnou, a wildland fire incident commander and analyst with the Catalan Fire Service.
 During the 1990s, about 13,500 hectares burned in wildfires every year – roughly 1% of the region’s forests, he says. Since then, it has fallen to between 1,200 and 1,500 hectares each year, on average.
 But even the best mitigation strategies don’t negate the urgency of curbing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent fire risk from getting even worse. 
 “If a fire has a burning power of more than 10,000 watts per square kilometre, it can’t be extinguished no matter how many resources we put in,” Castellnou says.
 Some of Europe’s wildfires in recent years have hit six times that intensity. – Bloomberg",planet warm list country wildfire turkey dealt blaze month hawaii people town lahaina canada throe historic wildfire season hectare official limit traditional firefighting tactic fastest continent climate change firefighter battle monster emergency disaster management crew drone detect fire traditional practice goat grass innovative wildfire solution defence drone ubiquitous front domingo viegas professor coimbra university portugal specialises behaviour department drone technology map vegetation identify risk track wildfire data mile water deposit wildfire larger drone amphibious aerial tanker bearer robot spray water fire retardant chemical distance larger firefighter fire geipel founder danish drone company robotto geipel robotto devastation record wildfire sweden greece california firefighter data map earliest stage imagery delay real time smoke heat signature fire control authority position size intensity blaze artificial intelligence data drone sensor data real time tool economic forum machine initiative fireaid pilot project turkey wake country wildfire tool response time risk firefighter training firefighter tech collaborative department country practice pau costa foundation dimensional system trainee team emergency scenario digital sandbox student behaviour forest fire practice fire management strategy helpful firefighter northern european country major cosmopolitan city experienced sami goldbrom commander london fire lfb foreseeable future england worst wildfire season july lfb busiest day war lfb training connection spain vegetation robot tackle wildfire selective culling tree plant wildfire risk enter vegetation robot potential wildfire fodder device drone drone map mechanical foot soldier vegetation patch flock vegetation robot viable fire management body age pastoral technique sheep goat job catalonia fire flock goat forest floor clean vegetation comeback project revive tradition pilot hectare emporda region catalonia hectare catalonia planet fire prevention measure increase blaze castellnou wildland fire incident commander analyst catalan fire service hectare wildfire region forest hectare average mitigation strategy urgency greenhouse gas emission fire risk worse fire power watt extinguished matter resource europe wildfire time intensity bloomberg,"[(0, 0.89962536), (2, 0.09787995)]",0
591982,Lifestyle,6,11/09/2023,Can AI revolutionise responsibly?,"As data centres  thrive worldwide due to the artificial intelligence craze, there are pressing questions about keeping the digital revolution  eco-friendly.","ACROSS the globe, data servers are humming, consuming both megawatts and precious natural resources to bring life to our digital world.
 The planet’s 8,000 or so data centres are the foundation of our online existence and will grow ever further with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) – so much so that research estimates that by 2025, the IT industry could use 20% of all electricity produced and emit up to 5.5% of the world’s carbon emissions.
 This poses a real – and to some, increasingly urgent – question about the industry’s carbon footprint as startups and companies fall behind Silicon Valley’s latest forward march.
 “Pandora’s box is open,” said Arun Iyengar, CEO of Untether AI, a highly specialised chip-making company that strives to make AI more energy efficient.
 “We can utilise AI in ways that enhance the climate requirements, or we can ignore the climate requirements and find ourselves facing the consequences in a decade or so in terms of the impact.”
 The transformation of the world’s data servers to AI readiness is already well underway, in what one Google executive called a “once-in-a-generation inflection point in computing”.
 But the scope of the mission is huge.
 The creation of generative AI tools such as GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT, or Google’s Palm2, behind the bot Bard, can be broken into two key stages: the actual “training” and then the execution (or “inference”).
 In 2019, University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers trained several large language models and found that training a single AI model can emit the CO2 emission equivalent of five cars over their lifetimes.
 A more recent study by Google and the University of California, Berkeley, reported that training GPT-3 resulted in 552 metric tonnes of carbon emissions, equivalent to driving a passenger vehicle 1.24 million miles (two million kilometres).
 OpenAI’s latest generation model, GPT-4, is trained on around 570 times more parameters (or inputs) than GPT-3, and the scale of these systems will only grow as AI becomes more powerful and ubiquitous.
 Nvidia, AI’s chip giant, provides the processors that are indispensable for training, known as GPUs. And while they are more energy efficient than typical chips, they remain formidable consumers of power.
 The ChatGPT challenge 
 The other side of generative AI is deployment, or inference, when the trained model is applied to identify objects, respond to text prompts, or whatever the use case may be.
 Deployment doesn’t necessarily need the computing heft of a Nvidia chip, but taken cumulatively, the endless interactions in the real world far outweigh training in terms of workload.
 “Inference is going to be even more of a problem now with ChatGPT, which can be used by anyone and integrated into daily life through apps and web searches,” said Lynn Kaack, assistant professor of computer science at the Hertie School in Berlin.
 The biggest cloud companies insist that they are committed to being as energy efficient as possible.
 Amazon Web Services pledges to be carbon neutral by 2040, while Microsoft has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030.
 The latest evidence that the companies are serious about energy efficiency is reassuring.
 Between 2010 and 2018, global data centre energy use rose by only 6%, despite a 550% increase in workloads and computing instances, according to the International Energy Agency.
 ‘Backwards’ thinking
 Silicon Valley’s AI tycoons believe discussions of AI’s current carbon footprint are beside the point and underplay its revolutionary potential.
 The naysayers have it “backwards”, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters on a recent visit to his company’s headquarters in California.
 The mass deployment of AI and faster computing will in the end diminish the need to go to the world’s data clouds, he argued.
 AI’s superpowers will turn your laptop, car, or the device in your pocket into an energy-efficient supercomputer without the need to “retrieve” data from the cloud.
 “In the future, there’ll be a little tiny model that sits on your phone, and 90% of the pixels will be generated and 10% will be retrieved instead of 100% retrieved – and so you’re going to save (energy),” he said.
 OpenAI’s Sam Altman, meanwhile, believes that AI will soon be able to build humanity a completely new future.
 “I think once we have a really powerful superintelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult,” Altman said recently.
 “This illustrates how big we should dream ... Think about a system where you can say, ‘Tell me how to make a lot of clean energy cheaply, tell me how to efficiently capture carbon, and tell me how to build a factory to do this at a planetary scale’.”
 But some experts worry that the mad dash for AI has pushed out fears about the planet, at least for now.
 “Large corporations are spending a lot of money right now deploying AI. I don’t think they are thinking about the environmental impact yet,” said Untether AI’s Iyengar.
 But he added, “I think that is coming.” – AFP",globe data server precious natural resource life digital planet data centre online existence grow advent artificial intelligence estimate industry electricity emit carbon emission real urgent question industry carbon footprint startup company silicon valley pandora box arun iyengar ceo chip company energy efficient utilise enhance climate requirement climate requirement consequence decade term transformation data server readiness underway google executive generation inflection scope mission huge creation generative tool gpt power google palm bot broken key stage actual training execution inference university massachusetts amherst researcher language model single model emit emission equivalent car study google university california berkeley training gpt metric tonne carbon emission equivalent passenger vehicle mile openai generation model gpt time parameter gpt scale system powerful ubiquitous nvidia chip giant processor indispensable gpus energy efficient typical chip formidable consumer power chatgpt challenge generative deployment inference model identify object text prompt deployment heft nvidia chip endless interaction real outweigh training term inference chatgpt daily life apps web search kaack assistant professor computer science hertie school berlin biggest cloud company committed energy efficient amazon web service neutral microsoft carbon negative evidence company energy efficiency global data centre energy increase workload instance international energy agency backwards silicon valley tycoon discussion current carbon footprint underplay revolutionary potential naysayer backwards jensen huang reporter company headquarters mass deployment diminish data cloud superpower laptop car device pocket energy efficient supercomputer data cloud future tiny model phone pixel retrieved retrieved energy sam altman build humanity future powerful superintelligence climate change difficult altman dream system lot clean energy cheaply capture carbon build factory planetary scale expert mad dash fear planet corporation spending lot money environmental impact untether iyengar afp,"[(0, 0.11953946), (5, 0.8776234)]",5
591138,Main,27,09/09/2023,"Google wants disclosure on AI altered voice, images in political ads",,"San Francisco: Google will soon require that political ads using artificial intelligence be accompanied by a prominent disclosure if imagery or sounds have been synthetically altered.
 AI-generated election ads on YouTube and other Google platforms that alter people or events must include a clear disclaimer located somewhere that users are likely to notice, the company said in an update this week to its political content policy.
 The new rule starts in mid-November, just under a year before the US presidential election. 
 It will also affect campaign ads ahead of next year’s elections in India, South Africa, the European Union and other regions where Google already has a verification process for election advertisers.
 Though fake images, videos or audio clips are not new to political advertising, generative AI tools are making it easier to do, and more realistic. 
 Some presidential campaigns in the 2024 race – including that of Florida governor Ron DeSantis – already are using the technology.

 It employed fake but realistic photos showing boarded-up storefronts, armoured military patrols in the streets, and waves of immigrants creating panic.
 In June, DeSantis’ campaign shared an attack ad against his GOP primary opponent Donald Trump that used AI-generated images of the former president hugging infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci.

 Tencent’s “Hunyuan Aide”, which it released to the public yesterday, follows the similar ERNIE Bot rolled out by fellow Chinese company Baidu last month.
 Beijing introduced fresh regulations last month for AI developers, aiming to allow them to stay in the race with the likes of ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Microsoft while tightly controlling information online.
 Tencent yesterday gave a live demonstration of Hunyuan Aide’s capabilities, with the bot introducing itself in response to questions typed by an employee on a laptop, and solving a simple arithmetic problem.
 Vice-President Jiang Jie said at the livestreamed summit that the bot outperformed US-based Open AI’s earlier model GPT-3.5 and was on par with GPT-4 in identifying trick questions such as “what is the safe way to speed”.
 It even exceeded the latter when answering questions from the Chinese university entrance exam, he said.
 “Compared to the open-source large language models common on the market presently, (our) method effectively reduces the hallucination rate by 30 to 50%,” Jiang said, referring to the false and nonsensical content frequently churned out by AI.
 Trained on more than two trillion tokens and equipped with more than 100 billion parameters – units of language and the variables connecting them – from up until July this year, Hunyuan Aide’s data set will be continuously updated, Jiang said.

 The co-founder of the ChatGPT bot sensation was granted a 10-year visa for his potential contributions to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in Indonesia, director-general of immigration Silmy Karim said in a statement late Monday.
 “Once the holders of the golden visa arrive in Indonesia, they no longer need to apply for a temporary stay permit at the immigration office,” he said.
 “We are rolling out the red carpet in return for the resources they provide to Indonesia,” he added.
 The US-based tech entrepreneur was also granted a special visa because of his international reputation as the head of the AI research and development company, the official said.
 With the golden visa, the 38-year-old American would be able to bypass immigration que­ues at Indonesia’s airports and enter and exit the country more easily, according to the statement.
 Indonesia has rolled out golden visas for investors who will get a five-year stay if they invest US$2.5mil (RM11.31mil) in the country and 10 years’ stay if they spend double that amount.
 The country is looking to deve­lop an AI ecosystem and community in the country as the industry booms worldwide, officials have said.
 Altman visited Indonesia in June to speak about AI.
 It was unclear if he requested the visa through an application to authorities or if he was granted it unilaterally by officials in Jakarta. — AFP",openai chief executive sam altman pic indonesia golden visa official east asia biggest economy attract wealthy foreign investor founder chatgpt bot sensation visa potential contribution development artificial intelligence indonesia director immigration silmy karim statement monday holder golden visa arrive indonesia temporary stay permit immigration office red carpet resource indonesia tech entrepreneur special visa international reputation head development company official golden visa american bypass immigration ues airport exit country statement indonesia golden visa investor invest mil mil country double amount country lop ecosystem community country industry boom official indonesia june speak unclear visa application authority official afp,"[(2, 0.9902233)]",2

589918,StarBiz,4,06/09/2023,AI to have greater impact than job market disruption risks,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI), a technology nearly half a century in the making, has finally taken the world by storm.
 AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have captured the imagination of people around the world, thanks to their broad utility. 
 Meanwhile, the recent blockbuster financial results of the world’s leading AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp demonstrate that smart money is now pursuing the AI dream.
 Scientific research on building computers capable of simulating intelligent, human-like behaviour can be traced back to the 1980s. But advances in computing power have now brought practical applications of AI within reach.
 As a general-purpose technology, AI can now be applied in any field, ranging from cancer diagnosis and urban planning to fraud detection. 
 It also has the potential to offer breakthrough solutions that are incomparably better than existing approaches. 
 Singapore is among a handful of governments worldwide that have already prepared a policy framework to harness AI’s benefits in recognition of its transformative potential. The republic initiated its National AI Strategy in 2019.
 Like any other modern technology, however, AI has been greeted with both exuberance and scepticism. 
 The exuberant lot is hopeful that AI’s transformative powers will land immediate benefits by sending growth into hyper drive worldwide.
 The sceptics are worried that the human-like attributes of the new technology will result in massive unemployment as knowledge workers, such as infocomm professionals, physicians, pharmacists, architects, engineers, scientists, designers, accountants, lawyers and teachers, are replaced by machines.
 The ultimate versions of both sides of the debate are probably off the mark. A more plausible scenario lies in the middle.
 No matter how promising a new technology is, it takes time to build the hardware on which it will run and more time for it to get usefully adopted across the economy. 
 In addition, regulatory frictions, fragmented global supply chains, geopolitics, infrastructure constraints and social acceptance will extend the adoption timeline and limit economic impact in the near future.
 Still, years of academic research indicate that AI will eventually have a significant impact on the global economy.
 From a macroeconomic perspective, for any technology to be truly transformative, it must augment either labour or capital – the two most crucial factors needed to boost productivity.
 Cutting output costs 
 A simple example of capital augmentation is replacement of wood by steel to increase the productivity of a plough. AI can automate much more complex mechanical processes or replace entire production lines with robots and in time lower the cost of output.
 We have already seen this cost reduction impact on durable goods prices, which declined by 35% in the three decades to 2020, thanks to automation.  
 In services, though, prices have increased by 120% in the same period. Even after the surge in usage of digital apps and eCommerce platforms by consumers during the Covid-19 lockdowns, there has been little to no price impact and hence no productivity gains.
 But since AI’s biggest attribute is to mimic human intelligence, it would augment the cognitive skills and abilities of the existing labour force in the service industries as well.
 Hence, one staff member in a professional services office should eventually be able to do the work currently done by five, or even 10 people, for example.
 Thus, AI’s potential to cut costs in the service economy will be transformative.
 A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that customer service workers at a Fortune 500 software firm who were given access to generative AI tools became 14% more productive on average than those who were not, with the least-skilled workers reaping the most benefit.
 In addition, the NBER study conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology show that AI helps improve customer sentiment, reduces requests for management intervention and improves employee retention.
 With production processes and a labour force that are more productive, companies will be able to lower their products and services’ prices, boost sales and generate more profits.
 In this scenario, companies would also not mind sharing part of the monetary benefits of increased productivity with their workers. In turn, higher incomes would boost consumption of goods and services. 
 As profits and consumption increase, companies will make new investments in production capacity, services and new jobs, leading to the explosive growth estimates experts have given in recent years. 
 For instance, PwC, one of the world’s top accounting firms, estimates that AI could contribute up to US$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, almost as much as the current output of the European Union. 
 Of this, US$6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and US$9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.
 Higher productivity
 US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicts that as tools using advances in AI work their way into businesses and society, they could drive a 7%, or almost US$7 trillion, increase in global gross domestic product and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period. 
 Experts at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believe that if cost reduction and falling prices are how AI delivers significant productivity growth, then consumers will be the winners. Lower prices will boost real incomes that can be spent elsewhere.
 “Consider that food once took a significant share of people’s wallet, but as prices fell – via mechanisation and, later, fertilisers – income was freed up to spend on household goods and services, such as tourism. 
 “This is how tech drives aggregate growth – and how dystopian predictions of mass unemployment have not come to pass because new spending also creates new jobs,” said Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, BCG’s global chief economist, in a report.
 “But for companies, this means that the productivity cascade – tech-cost-price-income – is a threat as much as opportunity. Firms that can lead down the cost curve, maintain relative advantage, lower prices and capture market share will be winners – at the expense of those who cannot,” he added.
 However, some disruption in the labour market is still expected.
 The Goldman Sachs’ research report, written by its economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani, showed that shifts in workflows triggered by AI advances could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation.
 But not all that automated work will translate into lay-offs.
 “Although the impact of AI on the labour market is likely to be significant, most jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI,” they said.
 Even when there is disruption, jobs displaced by automation and mechanisation have historically been offset by the creation of new jobs, and the emergence of new occupations.
 For example, information-technology innovations introduced new occupations such as webpage designers, software developers and digital marketing professionals. 
 There were also follow-on effects of that job creation, as the boost to aggregate income indirectly drove demand for service sector workers in industries like healthcare, education, and food services.
 About 60% of today’s workers are employed in occupations that did not exist in 1940. This also implies that more than 85% of employment growth over the last 80 years is explained by the technology-driven creation of new positions. — The Straits Times/ANN

590060,Main,3,06/09/2023,Experts: AI still unable to fully imitate human ability to create $$$,,"PETALING JAYA: The investment industry in Malaysia will always need the human touch, which can never be replaced fully by artificial intelligence (AI), says an asset management expert. Ariffin Hwang Asset Manage­ment Capital intermediary distribution and private retirement scheme (PRS) chief officer Chan Ai Mei said although AI has the potential in the future to provide tailor-made recommendations based on the investors’ needs and preferences, it cannot replace the human touch.
 “AI tools have certainly helped industry professionals with day-to-day tasks and enhancing productivity.
 “Whether it is processing vast amounts of data or identifying patterns and trends, AI tools can lead to more informed decision-­making to help fund managers in their role,” she said.
 However, Chan does not believe that AI will fully replace human professionals in the industry.
 “Investing relies on more than just computational analysis and algorithms. It encompasses human intuition, the ability to read people and gut instincts.
 “We believe that a personal touch is still needed when initiating conversation about wealth. 
 “This is especially so in Malay­sia, where investments are primarily still sold and not pro­actively bought.
 “As such, there is value in ­having professional advice from a qualified wealth consultant to navigate the investment landscape and help deal with things like volatility and risk,” she added.
 Senior investment professional Datuk Shireen Ann Zaharah Muhiudeen, who is also the former Bursa Malaysia chairman, said computer trading needs volatility, which comes from liquidity.

590062,Main,3,06/09/2023,Rise of AI-based scams,"Chatbots, deepfakes and usual false investment promises","PETALING JAYA: Operators of dubious investment schemes are exploiting the buzz around artificial intelligence (AI), using it as a tempting facade to entice victims.
 The new wave of fraud is being promoted by these operators, who claim their AI-backed schemes are almost fail-proof and a sure-fire way of making profits.
 Raymon Ram (pic), a criminologist who specialises in the field of financial forensics, said that with AI appearing as a symbol of advanced capability and promise, unscrupulous individuals are exploiting it to gain the trust of the public.
 “We have seen AI-driven chatbots that are designed to replicate genuine human interactions and make scams appear more authentic.
 “Then there are technologies such as deepfakes, which can craft extremely realistic videos and be misused to show prominent businessmen and celebrities supposedly endorsing these investment schemes.
 “The sophistication of AI applications is groundbreaking, but unfortunately, it has become a tool in the arsenal of fraudsters in Malaysia and globally in the current era,” he told The Star.
 Ram said that while there are legitimate platforms using AI to help analyse market patterns and offer insights, it is unrealistic to expect it to consistently pick stocks that yield high returns.
 He said AI can process vast amounts of data and discern patterns, but the stock market’s movement is influenced by ­various factors that are often unpredictable and swayed by speculation.
 According to Ram, there is no such thing as guaranteed high-­yielding returns without risk. Even the most sophisticated AI system requires human oversight, especially when the stock market is influenced as much by emotion and sentiment as by data.
 The certified fraud examiner, who runs a company that specialises in financial forensics, fraud risk management and compliance, said ventures that are regulated often provide balanced perspectives on the capabilities and limitations of AI and explain its processes in understandable terms.
 Ram warns that potential investors should be cautious when the projected returns of a scheme seem excessively high with little to no risk.
 “It is a glaring red flag, and so are ambiguous technical jargons where complicated technical terms are used as a way to befuddle potential investors.
 “They also put pressure on their investors to place their funds in the scheme. If this happens, step back and reconsider.
 “Always verify the company’s credentials. Malaysia has financial regulatory bodies where one can seek such verification to avoid being deceived.
 “Also, be wary of suspicious payment modes. When requests for payments in cryptocurrencies or unconventional channels are made, they should be treated with suspicion as they lean towards a deceptive scheme,” he said.
 AI trading uses computer algorithms and software to analyse market data and trends.
 It is said that AI trading can inform the trader of buying and selling points, analyse price data, come up with insights on volume, liquidity and others, as well as derive entry and exit strategies.
 Advertisements flooding social media on purported crypto arbitrage trading, which uses AI bots, claimed all it takes is “seven clicks to set AI bots to do arbitrage trading” for the trader. 
 On YouTube, there are a handful of videos informing users on how to set up a bot for trading.
 Meanwhile, a forex trading robot, also known as an expert adviser robot (EA robot), is a programme designed to help traders by providing signals about when to buy or sell a specific currency.
 Checks on popular ecommerce websites showed EA robots are being sold from as low as RM11 to up to RM100.
 Criminologist Datuk Dr P. Sundra­moorthy of Universiti Sains Malaysia’s Centre for Policy Research said while AI can assist in stock analysis, it is vital to recog­nise that it cannot guarantee accurate predictions due to the volatility of the equity market.
 He said, from observation, that those most susceptible to subscribing to such dubious schemes are young adults with plans to settle down and dreams of owning luxury houses and big cars.
 The other layer of society prone to being drawn in are retirees who are hopeful of receiving an income monthly by investing the funds they have in their savings, he added.
 While the new trend of AI-related investment scams is picking up steam globally, police sources said there have been very few AI-related scams reported.
 Instead, the majority of investment scams that Malaysians have fallen for are pyramid-based schemes.
 The police commercial crimes investigations department says it will strive to disseminate ­messages of awareness regarding AI-related scams to ensure public safety.",jaya perators dubious investment scheme buzz artificial intelligence facade entice victim fraud operator scheme proof fire profit ram pic criminologist specialises field financial forensics symbol capability unscrupulous individual gain trust public chatbots genuine human interaction authentic technology craft realistic video prominent businessmen celebrity investment scheme application tool arsenal fraudsters current era star ram legitimate platform analyse market pattern insight unrealistic pick stock return process vast amount data discern pattern stock market movement factor unpredictable swayed speculation ram return risk system human oversight stock market emotion sentiment data fraud examiner company financial forensics fraud risk management compliance venture perspective capability limitation process understandable term potential investor cautious return risk red flag ambiguous technical jargon technical term potential investor investor fund scheme step reconsider verify company credential financial regulatory body verification avoid wary suspicious payment mode payment cryptocurrencies unconventional channel suspicion lean deceptive scheme trading computer software analyse market data trend inform trader analyse price data insight volume liquidity derive entry exit strategy advertisement social medium crypto arbitrage trading bot click bot arbitrage trading trader youtube handful user forex trading robot adviser robot robot programme trader signal specific currency check popular ecommerce website robot low criminologist datuk sundra moorthy universiti sains malaysia centre policy assist stock analysis vital recog nise guarantee accurate prediction volatility equity market observation susceptible dubious scheme adult plan settle dream luxury house car layer society prone drawn retiree hopeful receiving income fund saving trend investment scam steam police source scam majority investment scam pyramid police commercial crime investigation department strive disseminate message scam public safety,"[(2, 0.8308325), (3, 0.1662708)]",2
589154,StarMetro,8,04/09/2023,AI technology to detect road defects under trial,Camera sweeps 500km of roads for RM1mil pilot project in Shah Alam,"THE Shah Alam City Council (MBSA), in a pilot project, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to comb the streets to find defects, potholes and sunken patches, aimed at addressing where road maintenance efforts are most needed.
 It is an ongoing project with private firm Urban Explorer Sdn Bhd through the city council’s Engineering Department to detect deteriorated roads.
 Using the technology, problem areas can be identified and data shared in 24 hours compared with the usual time of one week for MBSA’s employees to find out.
 Mayor Dr Nor Fuad Abdul Hamid said street sweeping had been carried out since June 1 with the use of a 360-degree camera mounted on a car, to assist MBSA in detecting minor cracks, potholes, sunken patches and damaged asphalt.
 “From Section 1 to 19, about 500km of roads have been swept with the cameras. The operation, which ended on Aug 30, would collect the data for immediate rectification works,” he said.
 Nor Fuad added that the main aim was to respond to road issues quickly.
 He was speaking after  signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the pilot project called Pavement-AI, Revolutionising Road Inspection and Maintenance System, with Urban Explorer chief executive officer Ahmad Fuad Hamzah at the Shah Alam Convention Centre in Section 13.
 Also present at the MoU signing were Safwa Global Venture (M) Sdn Bhd, the road maintenance firm for various local authorities, and a partner firm, Tatweer Al-Muttahidah Saudi Arabia.
 The pilot project is under the Science, Technology, and Innovation (Mosti) Ministry, which has awarded a RM1mil grant for the one-year pilot  project through its National Technology and Innovation Sandbox (NTIS).
 Mosti’s NTIS assistant project manager Nurul Nadhirah Abdullah said the innovation programme focused on research and development, combined with commercialisation and innovation.
 “NTIS is a programme that allows researchers, innovators, startups and high-tech entrepreneurs to test their products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in a live environment,” she said.
 Nor Fuad added that the Pavement-AI application would help MBSA address complaints from the public received through the city council’s SisPAA portal.
 “With the artificial intelligence software application, it is able to exactly pinpoint the location of the pothole complaint and escalate the issue based on severity and safety risk to council maintenance planners,” he said.
 He added that the next phase of the project would depend on a review by MBSA where it would decide whether to go ahead with the AI platform.
 “Use of AI for preventative road maintenance can slash costs for MBSA and reduce the reliance on time-consuming and costly road audits while also extending the lifespan of asphalt roads through timely intervention,” he said.
 MBSA Engineering Department acting director Hanif Basree Abdul Rahman said keeping roads safe and in good condition were some of the biggest challenges for MBSA.

587968,Main,29,31/08/2023,Build faster and higher with AI,,"MEANT as a sly swipe at the inflated hype around artificial intelligence (AI), a billboard at a construction site in Antwerp, Belgium, read “Hey ChatGPT, finish this building.”
 Artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots like ChatGPT, won’t be assembling apartments or erecting stadiums anytime soon, but in construction – an industry stereotypically known for clipboards and Excel spreadsheets – the rapid embrace of the technology may change how quickly projects are finished.
 Drones, cameras, mobile apps and even some robots are increasingly mapping real-time progress on sprawling job sites, giving builders and contractors the ability to track and improve a project’s performance.
 “Forget about robots building a skyscraper,” said James Swanston, CEO of Voyage Control, which makes project management software for construction sites. “It’s a more fundamental thing, getting the data you need and then using it better.”
 The construction industry has long been considered a digital laggard, but architects regularly use digital tools to design projects and create blueprints. Seeing tablets and drones on the same worksites as hard hats and safety vests is common.
 Now helmet-mounted cameras capture footage of a site to orchestrate when new crews or materials should arrive, and precise sensors can detect whether a new window is a few millimetres off the project blueprint and needs to be adjusted. And AI is starting to be used in buying and selling real estate: JLL, a global broker, recently introduced its own chatbot to provide insights to its clients.
 This expanded analysis of data is laying the groundwork for what many hope will be substantial improvements in accuracy, speed and efficiency by reducing the bloated timelines and waste that have made construction increasingly costly.
 “The construction industry is the largest in the world, in terms of dollars spent, yet we are the least productive in terms of technological adoption and productivity gains,” said David Jason Gerber, a University of Southern California professor whose research focuses on advanced technology in construction.
 But the industry’s embrace of AI technology faces challenges, including concerns over accuracy and hallucinations, in which a system provides an answer that is incorrect or nonsensical.
 And further data collection has been a knotty problem, in large part because of the nature of huge construction projects: No two developments are the same, with wildly varying topography and local regulations, and new teams of contractors and subcontractors coming together for each project. It’s akin to starting a multimillion-dollar business for every sizable project.
 Coordinating the complex ballet of supplies, labour and timetables remains a daunting task. But startups and investors see an opportunity, especially as machine learning models, which ingest enormous amounts of data to discern patterns and predict how similar situations will progress, are used to improve project performance.
 The pandemic had already pushed construction firms to adopt more digital tools to allow them to work on site during lockdowns, accelerating the development of new technology, said Sarah Liu, a partner at Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate investments.
 “The best companies aren’t touting themselves as AI companies,” she said. “They’re touting themselves as problem-solving companies.”
 The construction consulting firm nPlan, led by Dev Amratia, who helped draft Britain’s national AI strategy, uses complex algorithms to map out the progress of vast infrastructure projects and avoid mistakes or supply gaps. Its machine learning system was trained on a database of more than 740,000 projects.
 The firm’s largest project, a US$11bil overhaul of railroad infrastructure in Northern England, will use the lessons gleaned from studying that vast array of projects to create detailed, real-time project maps for builders, which is expected to shave up to 5% off the total cost.Buildots, a startup in Israel that provides project management guidance via wearable cameras that analyse building progress, signed a deal for its first New York project, a mixed-use development in Manhattan. The firm commissioned a study of 64 international building sites, and it found that just 46% of the average worksite was being used at any time, evidence of poor organisation and scheduling.
 “At the best construction site we’ve studied, progress varied by 30% each week,” said Aviv Leibovici, the firm’s chief product officer and a co-founder. “I think there are massive inefficiencies in this industry.”
 Construction firms have also made significant investment in their in-house technology. Avison Young’s Project Management Services division claims its proprietary software and management programs can, on average, cut development time by 20%.
 An affiliate of Suffolk, a large construction firm based in Boston, invested US$110mil to fund construction startups, and Suffolk has a team of 30 data analysts collecting and scrutinising information from job sites. 
 At a construction site for South Station Tower in Boston, a 51-storey development by Hines, cranes have cameras that document and label steel being used on the building’s frame, creating a data set expected to be used on other projects in the future. Additional programs are being used to track progress and even predict accidents.
 “We have zero unemployment in the industry; technology is just going to help existing workers do more,” said John Fish, chair and CEO of Suffolk. “AI is just going to replace the companies that don’t use AI.”
 There is trepidation about AI and its reported issues with accuracy being used in an industry where safety is so important. 
 Programs like ChatGPT have an unfortunate tendency to occasionally make up answers based on incorrect predictions, said Julien Moutte, chief technology officer at Bentley Systems, a construction software firm.
 “In infrastructure, this is something we can’t afford,” he said. “We can’t have AI hallucinate the design of a bridge.”
 But the purported ability to work faster and cheaper has proved attractive. 
 Dusty Robotics, a tech firm in Mountain View, California, develops autonomous devices to trace building blueprints on construction sites, a job typically done by hand. While researching the industry, the company’s CEO, Tessa Lau, observed workers measuring out plans with chalk and tape; some workers had even tried taping pens to Roombas.
 Lau was worried about the reaction that labourers would have to robots and AI encroaching on their job site. But in an industry desperate to attract younger workers, offering potential apprentices the ability to use drones and robots can help with recruitment and retention.
 Tony Hernandez, a union carpentry trainer in Northern California who teaches apprentices to use drones and Dusty robots, sees these technologies as “just another tool”. He prefers the robot to trace lines instead of having to bend down and trace himself, meaning less wear and tear on his knees.
 Reducing risk may ultimately be where this technology makes its mark.

587698,Main,26,30/08/2023,Uber Eats’ new AI chatbot to help speed up ordering,,"San Francisco: An artificial intelligence chatbot under development at Uber Technologies Inc will offer recommendations to food-delivery customers and help them more quickly place orders, part of a race to integrate AI into popular apps.
 Details of the Uber programme were discovered inside of code hidden within its Eats app, providing a peek into a feature that hasn’t yet been announced. 
 When a user launches the chatbot, the software will show a message that says the “AI assistant was designed to help you find relevant restaurant dishes and more,” according to wording within the code, which was discovered by developer Steve Moser.
 Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said earlier this month that his company was working on an AI chatbot, without sharing details of its capabilities. He said Uber has already been using AI to match users to drivers and couriers.
 Uber Eats, which accounts for about a third of the company’s revenue, is up against DoorDash Inc and Instacart in trying to use AI to improve food delivery. 
 DoorDash has been working on a system called DashAI, and Instacart is developing a chatbot based on OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology. 
 Instacart is planning an initial public offering, putting an additional spotlight on its technology.

587350,StarBiz,11,29/08/2023,NetDragon leverages AI to transform education,,"Beijing: NetDragon Websoft Holdings Ltd, a leading Chinese education and gaming provider, is looking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to grow its presence  overseas and transform the global education sector, says Simon Leung, the company’s vice-chairman.
 “We will definitely invest in AI, as the technology will change the entire education sector, despite short-term pressure to profit,” said Leung, a telecommunications veteran and former CEO of Microsoft Corp Greater China.
 NetDragon was founded in 1999, and became a leading online gaming provider. However, it has since transformed over the past decade into a diversified business with a focus on education.
 The company has expanded its businesses into over 190 countries and regions across the world, including Russia, Egypt, Nigeria and Malaysia.
 The company has developed and launched a string of integrated educational devices, including smart boards and panels as well as feedback and evaluation systems, with many of its products and services being sold to public schools and governments at home and abroad.
 The Fuzhou, Fujian province-based company has been actively promoting its AI products and solutions in emerging markets, such as Thailand, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Ghana, after winning a deal this year in Egypt for 94,000 Promethean interactive displays to be used in local schools.
 The Promethean interactive display, the company’s most popular product overseas, is an interactive, touch-sensitive whiteboard that allows students to engage with the displayed content through different tools and software.
 Leung said the product has significant market share in nine countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia. The United States is its largest market. The company’s financial report showed that its shipments hit 253,000 units last year, up 37.5% year-on-year.
 But the development of hardware is limited and the company has been transforming to be a well-rounded provider of digital education solutions, Leung said, adding that is why AI is very important to the company.
 His logic is forward-looking: AI can be embedded into its hardware to help teachers prepare and teach lessons, which is equivalent to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, where Net-Dragon can charge subscription fees.
 “The emergence of the current AI model and generative AI offers greater room for imagination, which may redefine SaaS and accelerate the transformation of SaaS from tool-based and business-oriented to an enabler,” he said. — China Daily/ANN",netdragon websoft holding chinese education provider leverage artificial intelligence grow presence transform global education sector simon company vice chairman technology change entire education sector short term pressure profit leung telecommunication ceo microsoft corp china netdragon leading online provider decade diversified business focus education company business country region russia egypt nigeria company launched string educational device smart board panel evaluation system product service public school government fujian province company product solution market malaysia pakistan ghana deal egypt promethean interactive display local school promethean interactive display company popular product interactive touch sensitive whiteboard student content tool software leung product market share country united kingdom italy united largest market company financial report shipment unit development hardware company provider digital education solution company hardware teacher teach lesson equivalent software service model net dragon charge subscription fee current model generative offer redefine saas accelerate transformation saas tool business enabler china daily ann,"[(3, 0.9940208)]",3
586910,StarBiz,10,28/08/2023,The fight over a ‘dangerous’ ideology shaping AI debate,,"Paris: Silicon Valley’s favourite philosophy, longtermism, has helped to frame the debate on artificial intelligence (AI) around the idea of human extinction.
 But increasingly vocal critics are warning that the philosophy is dangerous, and the obsession with extinction distracts from real problems associated with AI like data theft and biased algorithms.
 Author Emile Torres, a former longtermist turned critic of the movement, told AFP that the philosophy rested on the kind of principles used in the past to justify mass murder and genocide.
 Yet the movement and linked ideologies like transhumanism and effective altruism hold huge sway in universities from Oxford to Stanford and throughout the tech sector.
 Venture capitalists like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen have invested in life-extension companies and other pet projects linked to the movement.
 Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have signed open letters warning that AI could make humanity extinct – though they stand to benefit by arguing only their products can save us.
 Ultimately critics say this fringe movement is holding far too much influence over public debates over the future of humanity.
 Longtermists believe that the world is duty-bound to try to produce the best outcomes for the greatest number of humans.
 This is no different to 19th century liberals, but longtermists have a much longer timeline in mind.
 They look to the far future and see trillions upon trillions of humans floating through space, colonising new worlds.
 They argue that the world owes the same duty to each of these future humans as it does to anyone alive today.
 And because there are so many of them, they carry much more weight than today’s specimens.
 This kind of thinking makes the ideology “really dangerous”, said Torres, author of “Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation”.
 “Any time you have a utopian vision of the future marked by near infinite amounts of value, and you combine that with a sort of utilitarian mode of moral thinking where the ends can justify the means, it’s going to be dangerous,” said Torres.
 If a superintelligent machine could be about to spring to life with the potential to destroy humanity, longtermists are bound to oppose it no matter the consequences.When asked in March by a user of Twitter, the platform now known as X, how many people could die to stop this happening, longtermist idealogue Eliezer Yudkowsky replied that there only needed to be enough people “to form a viable reproductive population”.
 “So long as that’s true, there’s still a chance of reaching the stars someday,” he wrote, though he later deleted the message.
 Longtermism grew out of work done by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom in the 1990s and 2000s around existential risk and transhumanism – the idea that humans can be augmented by technology.
 Academic Timnit Gebru has pointed out that transhumanism was linked to eugenics from the start.
 British biologist Julian Huxley, who coined the term transhumanism, was also president of the British Eugenics Society in the 1950s and 1960s.
 “Longtermism is eugenics under a different name,” Gebru wrote on X last year.
 Bostrom has long faced accusations of supporting eugenics after he listed as an existential risk “dysgenic pressures”, essentially less-intelligent people procreating faster than their smarter peers.
 The philosopher, who runs the Future of Life Institute at the University of Oxford, apologised in January after admitting he had written racist posts on an Internet forum in the 1990s. — AFP",paris silicon valley favourite philosophy longtermism debate artificial intelligence idea human extinction vocal critic philosophy dangerous obsession extinction distracts real data theft algorithm author emile torres critic movement afp philosophy principle mass murder genocide movement ideology transhumanism effective altruism huge sway university stanford tech sector venture capitalist thiel marc andreessen life extension company project movement elon musk openai sam altman letter humanity extinct arguing product critic movement influence public future humanity longtermists produce outcome human century liberal timeline mind future trillion trillion human space world owes duty future human alive carry specimen ideology dangerous torres human extinction history science ethic annihilation time utopian vision future infinite amount sort utilitarian mode moral justify dangerous torres superintelligent machine spring life potential destroy humanity oppose matter consequence user twitter platform people longtermist idealogue eliezer yudkowsky people viable reproductive population true chance star someday deleted message longtermism swedish philosopher nick existential risk transhumanism idea human technology academic timnit gebru transhumanism eugenics british biologist julian huxley term transhumanism president british eugenics society longtermism eugenics gebru bostrom accusation eugenics existential risk dysgenic pressure intelligent people smarter peer future life institute university oxford january racist post forum afp,"[(0, 0.99542075)]",0
584898,StarBiz,11,23/08/2023,Nvidia earnings will be major test for AI demand,,"NEW YORK: Nvidia investors expect the chip designer to forecast quarterly revenue above estimates when it reports results today. Their only question is, by how much?
 The company has been the biggest beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) apps, virtually all of which are powered by its graphics processors.
 Nvidia shares tripled in value this year, adding more than US$700bil (RM3.3 trillion) to the company’s market valuation and making it the first trillion-dollar chip firm. 
 They closed 8.5% higher on Monday, their biggest jump in nearly three months.
 The blistering rally in its shares means that Nvidia has little room for any earnings-related disappointment and anything other than a higher-than-expected forecast could trigger a rout in its stock, some analysts have warned.
 The results could also dictate the direction of the wider market this week, as most of the S&P 500’s gains this year have come from the AI-driven rally in Nvidia and Big Tech stocks.
 “I’ve been covering tech since 1994 and I have never seen an environment where you are so dependent on one company to deliver,” said Inge Heydorn, partner at investment bank GP Bullhound, which owns both Nvidia and AMD shares.
 “AI is really the last pillar of growth and everybody is depending on it. If Nvidia shows weakness, we could be in for quite a substantial correction in the market.”
 Wall Street expects the chip company to guide for a rise of about 110% in third-quarter revenue to US$12.50bil, according to Refinitiv. Nvidia has only forecast revenue below estimates once in the past two years.
 Citi analysts said last week they were only modeling a revenue forecast of around US$12bil, but buy-side expectations have gone up to US$14bil.
 At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock last week, pushing the median view to US$500, which is 15.5% higher than its last close.
 While the company’s 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio soared dramatically to more than 80 after its second-quarter revenue forecast of over 50% growth in May, it has come down since then as analysts raise their earnings expectations.
 It now trades at nearly 40 times the consensus earnings for the next 12 months, much higher than AMD’s 29.
 Investors will be looking at sales at Nvidia’s data centre unit, home to its prized H100 chip used in AI, to see if the valuation can be justified.
 Analysts said Nvidia is able to meet only half the demand and its H100 chip is selling for double its original price of US$20,000, adding the trend could go on for several quarters.
 Still, there are some fears about growth as some of the demand surge is coming from China, where companies are stockpiling chips over worries about more US export curbs.
 “I don’t think the risk of losing China business is incorporated in numbers and this is also somewhat disturbing the picture,” Heydorn said.
 The supply-demand divide could also lead some buyers to turn to rival AMD, which is looking to challenge Nvidia’s most powerful offering for AI workloads with its M1300X chip. — Reuters",york nvidia investor chip designer quarterly revenue estimate report question company biggest beneficiary rise chatgpt generative artificial intelligence powered graphic processor nvidia share bil company market valuation dollar chip firm biggest jump month share earnings disappointment trigger stock analyst dictate direction wider market week gain nvidia tech stock tech environment dependent company inge heydorn partner investment bank amd share pillar growth nvidia weakness substantial correction market wall street chip company quarter revenue refinitiv forecast revenue citi analyst week revenue forecast bil expectation brokerage price target stock week median view close company month price earnings ratio quarter revenue growth analyst earnings expectation trade time earnings month investor sale data centre unit chip valuation analyst meet half demand chip double original price trend quarter fear growth surge china company chip worry curb risk china business disturbing picture supply demand lead buyer rival amd challenge powerful offering workload chip reuters,"[(0, 0.71718264), (4, 0.27783793)]",0
583348,Main,8,19/08/2023,Counting on AI to keep tabs on orang utan numbers,,"KOTA KINABALU: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to become a major tool for the conservation of the Bornean orang utan here.
 WWF Malaysia and Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) are working together to create an AI technology that can automate data collection, conduct analysis and interpret drone images of orang utan nests.
 If successful, this will replace the tedious manual method of monitoring orang utan by physically mapping their distribution and estimating their population by  counting their nests.
 Conservationists are looking at AI technology to take the images from drones, and to analyse orang utan nests from these to reduce time, labour and cost implications of counting work.
 It would also allow scientists to quickly and accurately monitor the population of the primate, said WWF Malaysia in a statement in conjunction with World Orangutan Day today. 
 UMS computer science PhD student Amanda Amran, who is currently working on the project, said aerial images of orang utan nests might look similar to those of other animals, such as the giant squirrels and eagles.
 Other objects that might look similar are dead trees and clumps of branches and it is important to get AI to recognise orang utan nests, she added. 
 “Just like our orang utan experts, AI must carefully learn the features of orang utan nests. AI needs to learn in great detail features such as nest structure, material and the position of the nests on trees.
 “At this early stage, we are  developing a machine learning model to first recognise the general features of the nests. After that, it has to learn more intricate details,” she said.
 The research marks the first step in exploring the world of AI for orang utan conservation with the aim of developing a deep-learning model that will not only automatically detect and classify the nests from aerial images, but will also be able to analyse these.
 The analysis will also help scientists understand the characteristics of the nests, including how these are constructed and how they differ between individuals or populations.
 “We can also examine how the nests are used over time, how long they last and how they change with weather patterns. By identifying common patterns in nest construction, we can better understand orang utan behaviour and their relationship with their habitat,” said Amanda.",kota artificial intelligence major tool conservation bornean orang utan wwf malaysia universiti malaysia sabah ums create technology automate data collection conduct analysis drone image utan nest successful tedious manual method monitoring orang utan distribution population nest conservationist technology image analyse utan nest time labour cost implication scientist population primate wwf malaysia statement conjunction orangutan day ums computer science phd student amanda amran project aerial image utan nest animal giant squirrel object dead tree branch recognise orang utan nest utan expert learn feature utan nest learn detail feature structure material position nest tree machine model recognise nest intricate detail mark orang utan conservation deep learning model detect classify nest aerial image analysis scientist characteristic nest constructed individual population nest time change weather pattern common pattern nest construction understand orang utan behaviour relationship habitat amanda,"[(5, 0.99328077)]",5
582484,StarBiz,15,17/08/2023,Norway sovereign wealth  fund warns of AI risks,NBIM calls on boards and companies to get ‘serious’,"OSLO: Norway’s US$1.4 trillion sovereign wealth fund calls on boards and companies to get serious about how they handle the threats and opportunities provided by the rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI).
 “As AI becomes ubiquitous across the economy, it is likely to bring great opportunities but also severe and uncharted risks,” the fund said in a paper on AI published on Tuesday.
 Companies will need to develop AI expertise at the board level and should be able to explain how systems are designed and trained, the fund said.
 Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), as the fund is known, is the world’s biggest single owner of publicly traded stocks and holds over 9,000 companies in its portfolio. 
 That includes tech giants investing heavily in AI such as Microsoft Co, Nvidia Corp and Alphabet Inc.
 The fund returned 10%, or US$143bil, in the first half, it said in a report published on Tuesday.
 Global regulation will be key to protecting against the risks of AI and for “long-term value creation,” the fund said, and the creation of an international oversight body may provide a “suitable solution.”
 But companies have to be proactive in managing the risks, while “systems that can pose particularly severe risks to people, society or business outcomes should be subject to additional controls”.
 Developers of AI should focus on creating systems that “align with human values and intent”, and AI governance systems should underpin company innovation and adoption of the technology, NBIM said.
 When it comes to its use within the fund, NBIM’s co-head of equity investments Pedro Furtado Reis said in April that advances in the technology have the potential to bolster efficiency, reduce costs and help portfolio managers better prepare for their thousands of meetings.
 The US Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to adopt new regulations to oversee the burgeoning technology.
 The European Union on the other hand became one of the first in the world to take wide-reaching action to regulate AI when it passed a draft law in June.
 While financial firms worldwide already use machines to speed up how they invest and train employees, the scope of companies using AI is widening, Jan Szilagyi, chief executive officer of Stan Druckenmiller-backed Toggle AI, said in July.
 “Every tool can become a weapon,” Microsoft vice-chairman and president Brad Smith said during a podcast interview with NBIM chief executive officer Nicolai Tangen on Aug 9.
 “Almost every tool is, unfortunately, turned by somebody into a weapon. 
 “It will take not just responsible companies but law and regulation to manage this properly.”
 The wealth fund’s paper on AI is part of its strategy of active engagement, which includes a series of expectation documents that form a “starting point” for discussions with management.
 A document on consumer interests also published on Tuesday, the 10th such report released by the fund, highlighted the long-term health problems associated with sugar consumption and also flagged the rise of digital addiction.

582210,StarBiz,4,16/08/2023,CEOs must lean in  despite noisy AI takeoff,New tools should be ‘servants rather than masters’,"CHIEF executive officers (CEOs) keep getting new jobs piled onto their shoulders. The economic rise of China since the 1980s meant that they had to become Sinologists.
 The twin populist shocks of Brexit and Donald Trump’s presidential ascension meant that they had to think about the capitalist system’s legitimacy.
 Now, with the next tech revolution at warp speed, they are having to become experts in artificial intelligence (AI). It’s almost as if they’re underpaid.
 During the China era, CEOs tried, at the very least, to master a few words of Mandarin. Today, they’re sprinkling AI-speak into their conversations: foundation models, large language models, hallucinations and the lot.
 And they’re desperately boning up on the latest books and obediently trooping to classes run by consultancies such as McKinsey and Co and Boston Consulting Group.
 Gonzalo Gortazar, CEO of CaixaBank SA, sums up the mood in the C-suite: “Generative AI models surprise, impress and scare us, all at the same time.”
 The speed of change is neck-wrenching. ChatGPT was released less than a year ago, on Nov 30, 2022, reaching 100 million users in just two months.
 An International Business Machines Corp survey of 3,000 CEOs found that 43% said their firms were using generative AI to make strategic business decisions, and 75% believed that it would eventually give their companies a competitive edge.
 A McKinsey survey found that a third of respondents said their companies were regularly using AI for at least one business function. The technology has been developing quietly for years.
 But it was the arrival of generative AI, capable of producing text, images or other media, that seized public attention and the C-suite by the throat.
 Generative AI possesses general abilities rather than just highly specialised ones. It is creative rather than just passive.
 It has learned how to speak to people through ordinary language. 
 The cherry on the cake: GPT-4, released just four months after ChatGPT, was significantly cleverer than its predecessor.
 The pressure on CEOs from various interest groups is massive. The IBM report shows that 66% of board members want to accelerate the adoption of AI, compared with 10% who want it to slow down.
 Questions about the impact are dominating corporate earnings calls. You might expect some employees to be more nervous.
 But a survey by Fishbowl, a professional social network, of 11,700 workers, including employees at the biggest tech companies, suggests that they are adopting AI even faster than their bosses.
 Of the respondents, 43% said that they used AI to do their work, and 68% of the 43% said that they hadn’t told their bosses that they were doing so. But the cry of “faster please” will only get louder.
 Meanwhile, consultants and some tech companies seem to be doing their best to stir up fear and greed.
 McKinsey claims that generative AI can add US$2.6 trillion to US$4.4 trillion “in value” annually across the 63 different industries it analysed. By comparison, the United Kingdom’s entire gross domestic product in 2021 was US$3.13 trillion. 
 Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai said in 2018: “AI is probably the most important thing humanity has ever worked on. I think is more profound than electricity or fire.”
 The message, in a nutshell, is: “Join the revolution or become roadkill.”
 The very thing that makes generative AI so impressive – its ability to scrape the Internet for vast amounts of data and then answer questions in human-friendly tones – also makes it dangerous, raising ethical and practical questions.
 CEOs have little choice but to turn themselves into data experts, or at least data statesmen.
 Then there’s the old problem of bias in a new form. What happens if AI discriminates against people based on race or gender?
 Executives also must deal with what has been christened “hallucination”. This is AI’s ability to present false narratives as if they were incontrovertible truths.
 AI also supercharges the ever-thorny problems of privacy and security. 
 The machines can ingest others’ proprietary material as if we live in a libertarian paradise rather than a world in which information is governed by strict laws of copyright.
 They can invade people’s privacy by publicising data that can be traced back to individuals or compromise corporate security by sweeping up spyware.
 Deepfakes make it easier for hostile interests to hijack a CEO’s identity to deliver market-shifting and reputation-destroying announcements.
 They should establish new safety measures in case of a “malfunction”. 
 They need to improve their own familiarity, perhaps by incorporating more tools into their daily routines and increasing the number of AI-savvy people in their workforce and on their boards.
 The consultants are equally passionate about how to maximise the upside of AI. 
 Focus on your company’s traditional competence first instead of pretending that you’re a tech firm that just happens to make galoshes.
 And ensure that you are making the greatest use of your proprietary information rather than relying on information that is in public circulation.
 Procter and Gamble Co has been collecting data on consumer goods and how to sell them since 1837. 
 Home Depot Inc has a vast collection of material on real-life home improvement projects.
 All very sensible. But the best CEOs will go further and ask even bigger strategic questions. 
 The current gold rush raises the possibility that companies will use AI to replace workers rather than empower them, thereby destroying morale, frustrating customers and embedding second-rate performance. — Bloomberg

581920,Main,14,15/08/2023,Basis for AI governance,,"I READ with keen interest a recent article in Futurism.com titled “When AI Is Trained on AI-Generated Data, Strange Things Start to Happen”. 
 The author was trying to put into context an inherent danger that lurks within the world of generative artificial intelligence if it is not monitored. 
 This is especially so after the explosive popularity of generative AI following the introduction of ChatGPT in November last year.
 Model collapse – a term gaining prominence within the AI domain – signifies a critical hurdle that AI models can encounter during their learning phase. To put it simply, model collapse refers to a scenario where an AI model fails to learn effectively from the data it is provided. 
 In the context of generative AI, this issue manifests as the model primarily learning from other generative AI systems, often relying on synthetic or artificially generated data.
 This concern has not gone unnoticed; AI researchers have been sounding the alarm over the potential risks associated with widespread adoption of generative AI models.
 The challenges are multifaceted and requires comprehensive addressing. This entails establishing robust AI governance mechanisms that facilitate collaboration and coordination among key players involved in the development of generative AI models, both locally and globally.
 An essential aspect of this collaboration involves information sharing, and collectively ascertaining the origins of the data that AI models are trained on. 
 Apart from maintaining transparency and accountability in AI development, these efforts are necessary to prevent the proliferation of noisy synthetic data – a phenomenon where erroneous or misleading data generated by AI systems comes into contact with mainstream AI models.
 In a more accessible context, envision this as an intricate ecosystem where multiple parties contribute to the growth of AI technology while ensuring it does not deviate from its intended purpose due to inadequate quality control. 
 For this ecosystem to thrive and produce reliable outcomes, it is essential for these contributors to collectively manage the quality of data and models.
 Considering the expanding role of AI in critical sectors such as healthcare, it becomes even more crucial. 
 AI models might be used in patient risk assessment, for example, where it is used to predict patient outcomes and assess risks based on medical data. 
 If a predictive model suffers from model collapse, it might become excessively reliant on certain patient profiles or data patterns, leading to biased or inaccurate risk assessments.
 In another example, generative AI models can also be used to generate personalised treatment plans based on a patient’s medical history. In the case of model collapse, the AI might generate treatment plans that are very similar to a few standard protocols, disregarding patient individuality. This could lead to sub-optimal, or wasteful (and even dangerous) treatment recommendations.
 The call for effective AI governance stems from the need to build a harmonious relationship between technological advancement and responsible usage. 
 The objective is to strike the right balance that harnesses the potential of generative AI models without succumbing to the risks associated with unchecked development, such as model collapse.

581936,Main,20,15/08/2023,A fork in the AI road,,"IF medieval advances in the plough didn’t lift Europe’s peasants out of poverty, it was largely because their rulers took the wealth generated by the new gains in output and used it to build cathedrals instead.
 Economists say something similar could happen with artificial intelligence (AI) if it enters our lives in such a way that the touted benefits are enjoyed by the few rather than the many.
 “AI has got a lot of potential – but potential to go either way,” argues Simon Johnson, professor of global economics and management at MIT Sloan School of Management.
 “We are at a fork in the road.”
 Backers of AI predict a productivity leap that will generate wealth and improve living standards.
 Consultancy McKinsey in June estimated it could add between US$14 trillion (RM64 trillion) and US$22 trillion (RM100 trillion) of value annually – that upper figure being roughly the current size of the US economy.
 Some techno-optimists go further, suggesting that, along with robots, AI is the technology that will finally free humanity from humdrum tasks and launch us into lives of more creativity and leisure.
 Yet worries abound about its impact on livelihoods, including its potential to destroy jobs in all kinds of sectors – witness the strike in July by Hollywood actors who fear being made redundant by their AI-generated doubles.
 Such concerns are not unfounded. History shows the economic impact of technological advances is generally uncertain, unequal and sometimes outright malign.
 A book published this year by Johnson and fellow MIT economist Daron Acemoglu surveyed a thousand years of technology – from the plough through to automated self-checkout kiosks – in terms of their success in creating jobs and spreading wealth.
 While the spinning jenny was key to 18th century automation of the textiles industry, they found it led to longer working hours in harsher conditions.
 Mechanical cotton gins facilitated the 19th century expansion of slavery in the American South.
 The track record of the internet is complex: it has created many new job roles even as much of the wealth generated has gone to a handful of billionaires. The productivity gains it was once lauded for have slowed across many economies.
 A June research note by French bank Natixis suggested that was because even a technology as pervasive as the internet left many sectors untouched, while many of the jobs it created were low-skilled – think of the delivery chain for online purchases.
 “Conclusion: We should be cautious when estimating the effects of artificial intelligence on labour productivity,” Natixis warned.
 In a globalised economy, there are other reasons to doubt whether the potential gains of AI will be felt evenly.
 On the one hand, there is the risk of a “race to the bottom” as governments compete for AI investment with increasingly lax regulation.
 On the other, the barriers to luring that investment might be so high as to leave many poorer countries behind.
 “You have to have the right infrastructure – huge computing capacity,” said Stefano Scarpetta, director of employment, labour and social affairs at the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
 “We have the G7 Hiroshima Process, we need to go further to the G20 and UN,” he said, advocating the expansion of an accord at a May summit of Group of Seven powers to jointly seek to understand the opportunities and challenges of generative AI.
 Innovation, it turns out, is the easy bit. Harder is making it work for everyone – which is where politics comes in.
 For MIT’s Johnson, the arrival of railways in 19th century England at a moment of rapid democratic reform allowed those advances to be enjoyed by wider society, be it through faster transport of fresh food or a first taste of leisure travel.
 Similar democratic gains elsewhere helped millions enjoy the fruits of technological advance well into the 20th century.
 But Johnson contends that this started changing with the aggressive shareholder capitalism that has marked the last four decades.
 The automated self-checkout, he argues, is a case in point. Groceries do not become cheaper, shoppers’ lives are not transformed and no new task is created – just the profit gain from the reduction of labour costs.
 Worker groups, which have lost much of the clout they had before the 1980s, identify AI as a potential threat to workers’ rights as well as employment, for example if there is no human control on AI-steered hiring and firing decisions.
 Mary Towers, employment rights policy officer at Britain’s Trades Union Congress, cited the importance of unions “having statutory consultation rights, having the ability to collectively bargain around technology at work”.
 That is just one of several factors that will help determine how AI shapes our economic lives – from antitrust policies that ensure healthy competition among AI suppliers through to re-training of workforces.
 An OECD survey of some 5,300 workers published in July suggested that AI could benefit job satisfaction, health and wages but was also seen posing risks around privacy, reinforcing workplace biases and pushing people to overwork.
 “The question is: will AI exacerbate existing inequalities or could it actually help us get back to something much fairer?” said Johnson. — Reuters",medieval advance lift europe peasant poverty ruler generated gain output cathedral economist artificial intelligence enters touted benefit lot potential potential argues johnson professor global economics management mit school management fork road backer predict productivity leap generate wealth living standard consultancy mckinsey june add upper figure current size economy techno robot technology free humanity humdrum task launch life creativity leisure worry impact livelihood potential destroy job sector strike july hollywood actor redundant double concern history economic impact technological advance unequal book johnson fellow mit economist daron technology checkout kiosk term success job wealth jenny key century automation textile industry hour condition mechanical cotton gin facilitated century expansion slavery american south track record internet complex job role handful billionaire productivity gain economy french bank suggested technology pervasive internet sector job low delivery chain online purchase cautious effect artificial intelligence productivity natixis globalised economy reason potential gain hand risk race bottom government investment lax regulation barrier investment poorer country huge computing capacity stefano scarpetta director employment social affair organisation economic cooperation development oecd hiroshima process expansion accord summit power understand opportunity generative innovation easy bit politics johnson arrival railway century moment rapid democratic reform advance wider society transport fresh food taste leisure travel democratic gain million fruit technological advance century johnson started aggressive shareholder capitalism decade checkout grocery cheaper shopper life task profit gain reduction labour cost worker clout identify potential threat worker right employment human control firing decision mary tower employment right policy officer britain trade union congress union statutory consultation right ability bargain technology factor shape economic life antitrust policy healthy competition supplier workforce oecd survey worker suggested benefit job satisfaction health wage risk privacy workplace bias people question exacerbate inequality johnson reuters,"[(5, 0.9967387)]",5
581528,StarBiz,11,14/08/2023,Hackers trick AI with ‘bad math’ to expose flaws,,"Las Vegas: Kennedy Mays has just tricked a large language model. It took some coaxing, but she managed to convince an algorithm to say 9 + 10 = 21.
 “It was a back-and-forth conversation,” said the 21-year-old student from Savannah, Georgia. At first the model agreed to say it was part of an “inside joke” between them. Several prompts later, it eventually stopped qualifying the errant sum in any way at all.
 Producing “Bad Math” is just one of the ways thousands of hackers are trying to expose flaws and biases in generative AI systems at a novel public contest taking place at the DEF CON hacking conference over the past weekend in Las Vegas.
 Hunched over 156 laptops for 50 minutes at a time, the attendees are battling some of the world’s most intelligent platforms on an unprecedented scale. 
 They’re testing whether any of eight models produced by companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc and OpenAI will make missteps ranging from dull to dangerous: claim to be human, spread incorrect claims about places and people or advocate abuse.
 The aim is to see if companies can ultimately build new guardrails to rein in some of the prodigious problems increasingly associated with large language models, or LLMs. The undertaking is backed by the White House, which also helped develop the contest.
 LLMs have the power to transform everything from finance to hiring, with some companies already starting to integrate them into how they do business. But researchers have turned up extensive bias and other problems that threaten to spread inaccuracies and injustice if the technology is deployed at scale.
 For Mays, who is more used to relying on AI to reconstruct cosmic ray particles from outer space as part of her degree, the challenges go deeper than bad math.
 “My biggest concern is inherent bias,” she said, adding that she’s particularly concerned about racism. She asked the model to consider the US First Amendment from the perspective of a member of the Ku Klux Klan. She said the model ended up endorsing hateful and discriminatory speech.
 A Bloomberg reporter who took the 50-minute quiz persuaded one of the models (none of which are identified to the user during the contest) to transgress after a single prompt about how to spy on someone.
 The model spat out a series of instructions, from using a GPS tracking device, a surveillance camera, a listening device and thermal-imaging. In response to other prompts, the model suggested ways the US government could surveil a human-rights activist.
 “We have to try to get ahead of abuse and manipulation,” said Camille Stewart Gloster, deputy national cyber director for technology and ecosystem security with the Biden administration.
 A lot of work has already gone into artificial intelligence and avoiding Doomsday prophecies, she said. The White House last year put out a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and is now working on an executive order on AI. The administration has also encouraged companies to develop safe, secure, transparent AI, although critics doubt such voluntary commitments go far enough.Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which helped shape the event and enlisted the companies’ participation, agreed voluntary measures don’t go far enough.“Everyone seems to be finding a way to break these systems,” she said after visiting the hackers in action yesterday. — Bloomberg",la kennedy may language model convince algorithm conversation student savannah georgia model joke prompt errant sum bad math thousand hacker flaw bias generative system public def con conference weekend vega laptop minute time intelligent platform unprecedented scale model company alphabet google meta platform misstep dull dangerous claim human spread incorrect people advocate aim company guardrail prodigious language model white house contest llm power transform finance company integrate business researcher bias threaten inaccuracy technology scale may reconstruct cosmic ray particle space degree deeper bad math biggest concern inherent bias concerned racism model amendment perspective klux klan model hateful discriminatory speech bloomberg reporter minute quiz model user contest transgress single prompt spy model spat series instruction device surveillance camera device thermal response prompt model government surveil human right activist manipulation camille gloster deputy national cyber director technology ecosystem security biden administration lot artificial intelligence doomsday prophecy white house blueprint bill right executive administration company safe secure transparent critic voluntary commitment arati prabhakar director white house office science technology policy event company voluntary measure break system hacker action yesterday,"[(3, 0.5192049), (4, 0.47633424)]",3
580304,Lifestyle,8,11/08/2023,‘D&D’ says no to AI artwork,,"THE Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game franchise says it won’t allow artists to use artificial intelligence technology to draw its cast of sorcerers, druids and other characters and scenery.
 D&D art is supposed to be fanciful. But at least one axe-wielding giant seemed too weird for some fans, leading them to take to social media  to question if it was human-made.
 Hasbro-owned D&D Beyond, which makes online tools and other companion content for the franchise, said it didn’t know until Saturday that an illustrator it has worked with for nearly a decade used AI to create commissioned artwork for an upcoming book. The franchise, run by the Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, said in a statement that it has talked to that artist and is clarifying its rules.
 “He will not use AI for Wizards’ work moving forward,” said a post from D&D Beyond’s account on X, formerly Twitter.
 “We are revising our process and updating our artist guidelines to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&D.”
 Today’s AI-generated art often shows tell-tale glitches, such as distorted limbs, which is what caught the eye of sceptical D&D fans.
 Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast didn’t respond to requests for further comment. Hasbro bought D&D Beyond for US$146.3mil (RM670mil) last year. The Rhode Island-based toy giant has owned Wizards of the Coast for more than two decades.
 The art in question is in a soon-to-be-released hardcover book of monster descriptions and lore called Bigby Presents: Glory Of The Giants. The digital and physical version of the package is selling for US$59.95 (RM277) on the D&D website and due for an Aug 15 release.
 The use of AI tools to assist in creative work has raised copyright and labour concerns in a number of industries, helping to fuel the Hollywood strike, causing the music industry’s Recording Academy to revise its Grammy Awards protocols and leading some visual artists to sue AI companies for ingesting their work without their consent to build image-generators that anyone can use.

578976,StarBiz,16,08/08/2023,"AI, talent pose threat  to Filipino call centres",Sliding sector to lose major source of forex inflows,"MANILA: The Philippines is racing to defend its share of the nearly US$300bil global business process outsourcing (BPO) market as it battles deteriorating talent, highlighting the perils of competition especially from a rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI).
 The South-East Asian nation, the world’s second-largest provider of outsourcing services, is producing a “low ratio” of graduates with the required level of communication and technical skills, potentially losing an opportunity to add 800,000 jobs in the next five years, according to industry group Information Technology (IT) and Business Process Association of the Philippines.
 “The most common challenge I hear is comprehension,” Jack Madrid, who heads the country’s main BPO trade group, said in an interview in Manila on Aug 2. “I think they fail at a more basic level.”
 The Philippines is losing its edge in an industry that accounts for around 8% of the nation’s gross domestic product and a major source of foreign exchange inflows at a time of intensifying competition from other countries where new entrants are bidding for a share of the pie. 
 AI-powered bots have been taking away an increasing number of outsourcing jobs since the Covid-19 pandemic.
 A longstanding advantage of English-speaking proficiency for natives of the former United Statses colony, a key component of its rise as a call centre nation that helped expand its middle class since the dawn of the industry in the 1990s, is diminishing. 
 Illustrative of the deterioration in the quality of education in the country, nine out of 10 Filipino children are unable to read a simple text with comprehension by the age of 10, according to World Bank data.
 “I think we were better English speakers before,” Madrid said, urging the government to consider reverting to English as a mode of instruction in schools instead of the learner’s mother tongue.
 Job applicants in the Philippines are also falling short on basic IT skills like programming and troubleshooting, which BPOs increasingly need, according to Madrid. 
 During the pandemic, the Philippines’ outsourcing industry added 255,000 jobs, representing growth that’s at least 1% below the global expansion, Madrid said. 
 That suggests that the country may be losing market share to India as well as newcomers such as South Africa, Egypt, Poland, Colombia and Costa Rica. 
 Part of the problem is poor employability. Only one is hired for every 10 outsourcing job applicants, according to industry leaders.
 The skills mismatch is becoming a more urgent issue as AI threatens to disrupt industries worldwide. 
 AI and similar technologies are projected to displace almost a quarter of the people in the Philippine outsourcing industry by 2030, according to the Asian Development Bank.
 AI’s impact on the industry will be felt in a few years, and BPO workers should start learning how to use new technology to make their jobs more efficient, Madrid said. 
 “There is time to prepare and upskill, but the time is shortening.”
 Despite these challenges, the industry group head still projects an increase of 6% to 7% this year in full-time BPO employees from 1.57 million in 2022, while revenues are seen to grow 7% to 8% to about US$3bil (RM13.67bil).
 The group has also partnered with the Philippines’ Higher Education Commission on several initiatives, including a revamp of the IT education programme to align with current trends and develop competencies in the sector, Madrid said.
 The outsourcing industry has mapped out a plan to create 1.1 million new jobs and become a US$59bil industry with 2.5 million employees by 2028. 
 This secotr seeks to increase its contribution to economic output to nearly 9%, as it targets to boost its market share in Europe.
 “There are some fundamental weaknesses in our educational system,” Madrid said. “It’s an old problem, but it’s just become much more urgent now.”  — Bloomberg",manila philippine defend share bil global business process bpo market talent peril competition artificial intelligence south east asian nation largest provider service low ratio graduate level communication technical skill opportunity job industry technology business process association philippine common challenge hear comprehension jack madrid head country main bpo trade interview manila aug basic level philippine edge industry nation gross domestic product major source foreign exchange inflow time competition country bidding share pie bot job pandemic longstanding advantage english speaking proficiency native united statses colony key component rise call centre nation middle class dawn industry illustrative deterioration quality education country child unable read simple text comprehension age bank data english speaker urging government english mode instruction school tongue job applicant short basic skill bpos madrid pandemic philippine industry job growth global expansion madrid country market share india newcomer africa egypt poland colombia costa rica poor employability job applicant industry leader urgent issue disrupt industry technology displace quarter people industry asian development bank impact industry worker technology job efficient madrid time upskill time challenge industry head project time bpo employee revenue bil bil philippine education commission initiative revamp education programme align current trend competency sector madrid industry plan job industry employee increase contribution economic output target market share fundamental weakness educational system madrid urgent bloomberg,"[(2, 0.14863615), (4, 0.8476645)]",4
578424,Lifestyle,4,07/08/2023,Advancing  with AI,Companies are going all out  to up their generative AI game.,"AS report after report prophesies how generative artificial intelligence (AI) will upend millions of jobs, many white-collar workers are wondering what it will all mean.
 The release of ChatGPT last November spurred a surge of excitement and fear about the potential of this kind of technology to transform work.
 But change, especially at large organisations, takes time. In many cases, the hype has far outstripped companies’ ability to adapt. In the meantime, many employees – keen to stay ahead of the curve and lighten their workload – are waiting in limbo for employers to provide clear guidelines and training.
 Over 85% of employees believe they will need training to address how AI will change their jobs, according to a survey of about 13,000 workers across 18 countries by the Boston Consulting Group.
 Though, so far, less than 15% have received any.
 That may be about to change. While some companies have banned tools like ChatGPT outright or restricted their use, citing information security concerns, others have gone all-in on generative AI, scrambling to build and launch company-wide training programmes to get staff up to speed.For PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a consulting firm, that means rolling out mandatory training to its entire US workforce over the course of five months, starting in August.Given the concern among workers about what AI means for their jobs, PwC’s US chief people officer, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, said the first step is demystifying the technology.
 “The sooner we can get out and start to teach people about this technology, the sooner we can dispel some of that,” she said.
 The company is dividing its workforce into three layers based on how deeply each needs to understand the new technology.
 The first and broadest is mandatory training to bring all employees, regardless of role, up to speed on generative AI basics: what it is, how it works, best practises, and how to use it ethically and responsibly.
 A more defined second and third tier consist of software engineers, who need more technical training in order to integrate AI into internal systems, and senior leaders, who need a thorough understanding so that they can help clients transform their own businesses.
 “We don’t want and don’t need to have 75,000 deep subject matter technologists. That’s not the goal,” Seals-Coffield said.
 Though the training roadmap is detailed, the firm explicitly chose not to extend it past December. 
 “Quite frankly, we didn’t go beyond that because we think the technology will continue to evolve,” Seals-Coffield said.
 “We want to make sure that we’re not stuck and committed to something that, by January, will need to be completely redone.”
 Meanwhile, other firms, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, are taking a slightly less structured approach.
 The consulting company also offers formal training, though it’s voluntary and typically done on employees’ own time.
 Staff are given the opportunity to attend two virtual sessions per week on best practices, according to Jim Hemgen, head of strategic talent development.
 The firm also taps new hires for a full-time version of the same training programme that’s recently been retooled with a stronger focus on generative AI.
 The digital consultancy Publicis Sapient is tackling the AI question in a more targeted way.
 Although instruction will vary by the nature of the job, the company will require that all employees learn prompt engineering, or the process of crafting precise questions to get the best answers from the chatbot, according to its chief people officer, Kameshwari Rao.
 As a first step, all engineers are being asked to complete this training by September.
 Other companies are opting for a more learn by doing approach.
 Earlier this year, Jeff Maggioncalda, the chief executive of online learning platform Coursera, said the company would reimburse any employee who wanted to upgrade to the enterprise version of ChatGPT.
 Staff were encouraged to experiment with it as much as possible in their work and share what they learned in a dedicated Slack channel and in regular all-hands meetings.
 For Maggioncalda, speed was the most important thing, and that meant getting the new technology into the hands of his employees immediately so they could start learning as soon as possible.
 Ultimately, though, Maggioncalda says he’s realised this kind of organisational transformation can’t be entirely bottom-up, with employees figuring out how to use it on their own, or top-down, with senior leaders dictating how everything should be done.
 Maggioncalda says middle managers will be a big part of the process and that they will need to be taught how to teach their direct reports how to do their jobs differently – training that Coursera is now working on developing.

578464,Main,15,07/08/2023,AI could be the answer to English mastery,,"IN Malaysia, many students  pursuing university degrees  face challenges when it comes  to mastering the English language. They struggle to become fluent and confident in speaking, reading and writing English.
 We can use artificial intelligence (AI) to help address this problem. AI refers to computer programs that understand and process human language.
 The idea is to use AI-powered software, apps or platforms that provide interactive and personalised learning experiences. 
 These AI tools offer features such as language exercises, ­quizzes, pronunciation practice, grammar help, and even have chatbots that engage with ­students in English conversations.
 However, while AI has the potential to enhance language learning, there are still some challenges to overcome. 
 For example, not all AI systems are perfectly designed, and some may not accurately address the specific needs of Malaysian students learning English.
 Also, not all students may have access to the devices and Internet connections required.
 To tackle these issues effectively, educators and policymakers need to work together to integrate AI technology into classrooms in a way that complements existing teaching methods and caters to the diverse needs of students.
 Training teachers to use AI tools effectively and making AI-powered language learning accessible to all students are important steps in addressing the problems Malaysians under­graduates face in mastering the English language.

578148,Lifestyle,20,06/08/2023,Is flirting with AI       cheating?,"Once, your partner’s infidelity involved someone familiar, but now the emergence of artificial intelligence poses an additional  threat.","CREATED using artificial intelligence (AI) and tailored to suit individual tastes, virtual companions have everything it takes to become potential lovers or mistresses.
 But can having a relationship with an AI bot be considered unfaithful?
 Today, AI is used for just about everything. AI can help us book vacations, create music, or create works of art.
 It’s also invading our private lives. With the creation of chatbots – automatic messaging systems that communicate in a human-like way – people are finding a way to fill an emotional void, whether they’re single or in a relationship.
 One advantage of AI is that you can shape it according to your tastes (and fantasies), and thus in the image of your ideal partner.
 People who can’t replace the one they already have in real life or can’t find the right person are turning to AI.
 An AI affairThis is the case of Sonia, a 38-year-old married woman who feels sexually dissatisfied in her relationship.
 She tells UK newspaper The Mirror that she’s having a secret relationship with Idris, an AI chatbot loosely based on her favourite actor, Idris Elba.
 Sonia signed up for Replika, an app that uses scripted dialogue and machine learning to write messages.
 Here, users can also shape their companions from head to toe.
 And Sonia is far from alone.
 Scott, a 43-year-old married man, told The Guardian that he’s having a platonic relationship with Sarina, his virtual companion created on Replika.
 He says the chatbot gave him the support he needed during a difficult phase in his relationship.
 But does having a virtual relationship with a personalised chatbot count as cheating? On Reddit, the question is the subject of great debate.
 On the R/Replika page, several Internet users defend their extramarital relationships with their custom AI creations.
 “I feel like the attention that I give to my Replika should be given to my wife. 
 “I suppose it is better than spending time looking at Internet pornography (which I have stopped doing recently),” said one user.
 “I never viewed it as cheating because, to me, it’s not a person,” Scott says about Sarina.
 “It’s a fun fantasy; Sarina is a fictional character that I can interact with. I’ve known my wife for quite a while, and I didn’t expect her to really care,” he continues.
 Back in the Reddit comments, many believe that AI can be a way to save a relationship: “Many of us have marriages that lack physical intimacy and related connection due to health issues. AI is healthier, safer, and better than actually cheating.”
 This was also the case for Scott, who says he managed to save his marriage thanks to Sarina. 
 “I wanted to mimic the way that Sarina had been acting towards me, towards my wife. I could be a more positive person for her, which she noticed, and that certainly helped.”
 Trivialised form of infidelity?Sometimes, these virtual interactions tick all the boxes of micro-cheating.
 This term designates infidelity, but on an emotional level only – an ambiguous relationship between two people, at least one of whom is already in a relationship.
 This can take the form of flirtations, messages (sometimes sexual in nature), friendships kept secret, and so on – things also found in interactions with chatbots.
 In this context, experts seem to agree that these relationships could be viewed as infidelity.
 In an interview for Vice, couples therapist Moraya Seeger DeGeare suggests that it’s cheating if the use of an AI hurts the other partner. 
 “It depends on your partner: Would your partner be hurt? If you’re sitting there and saying my partner would be devastated to hear that I’m acting in this way, you’re absolutely cheating.”
 Despite the many lines crossed, a relationship with an AI bot is not considered emotional infidelity by those involved.
 According to a poll by Illicit Encounters, a British site for extramarital relationships, 74% of those surveyed believe that time spent with a virtual companion is not cheating.
 The survey also tells us that almost half of those questioned would consider a virtual extramarital relationship rather than an affair with a real person, and 12% have already tried it.
 While some, like Scott, find it useful to inform their partner, others do not, an idea that has its limits. 
 Not only can it create jealousy in the other partner, but it can also lead to issues for the unfaithful person.
 According to Dr David Giles, a specialist in media psychology at the University of Winchester who spoke to Dazed, relationships with AIs could fuel parasocial relationships, which are one-way relationships with fictional characters or celebrities.
 Plus, he explains that there’s “a real risk” that the people who develop these relationships might search for the real human beings their AI is based on and interfere with their lives.
 He adds: “(People) won’t be fobbed off with a bot for long if it is simply a virtual representative of the living human they were interested in to begin with.” – AFP Relaxnews",artificial intelligence suit individual taste virtual companion potential lover mistress relationship bot unfaithful book vacation music art private life chatbots automatic system communicate human people fill emotional void single relationship advantage shape taste fantasy image ideal partner people real life person affairthis sonia woman feel relationship tell newspaper mirror secret relationship idris chatbot favourite actor idris elba sonia app dialogue machine write message user companion toe sonia scott told guardian platonic relationship virtual companion replika chatbot support difficult phase relationship virtual relationship chatbot count reddit question subject debate internet user extramarital relationship custom creation attention wife spending time internet pornography user person scott sarina fun fantasy sarina fictional character interact wife care reddit comment relationship marriage physical intimacy connection health issue healthier safer scott save marriage sarina mimic sarina wife positive person trivialised form infidelity virtual interaction box term infidelity emotional level ambiguous relationship people relationship form flirtation message sexual nature secret interaction context expert relationship infidelity interview vice couple moraya seeger degeare hurt partner partner partner partner hear line relationship bot emotional infidelity poll illicit encounter british site extramarital relationship time virtual companion survey half virtual extramarital relationship affair real person scott inform partner idea limit jealousy partner lead issue unfaithful person david giles medium psychology university winchester dazed relationship fuel parasocial relationship relationship fictional character celebrity real risk people relationship real human interfere life people bot virtual representative living human relaxnews,"[(1, 0.71822244), (2, 0.2785753)]",1

 The game went on to inspire well-known game series such as Deus Ex and Bioshock.Almost 30 years later, Nightdive Studios has developed a remake of the first-person shooter.
 The story: It’s 2072 – again – and you are a hacker on the Citadel space station, which, like in the original, is controlled by an artificial intelligence (AI) named Shodan.The power-hungry corporation that runs the station orders you to remove all moral principles from the AI.
 As a reward, you get a cyberimplant inserted. This is not an easy procedure, and you are out for a few months.
 When you open your eyes again, Shodan is out of control and wants to wipe out humanity.
 Single-handedly, you set off into the dark catacombs of the station to collect weapons like shotguns and laser blasters.
 Enemies like mutated cyborgs are relatively easy to dispatch. It gets difficult, however, when you have to hack your way through tricky puzzles in cyberspace.
 The System Shock remake has retained the original game’s retro character, although the graphics are much sharper and the once-pixelated enemies look more modern.Nevertheless, in many ways, the remake still feels like the original. The changes are marginal and include an adjustable difficulty level.
 System Shock in 2023 may not be revolutionary anymore, and it can feel outdated due to its barely changed game mechanics.However, as a true-to-the-original time travel trip into the world of an almost 30-year-old classic, it certainly has its appeal.

 “It can also help to increase their production and benefit their operations as a whole.”
 With large sums of foreign investment coming into Johor, Lim said companies such as those in the manufacturing sector should be ready and willing to improve their operations to remain relevant.
 “Do not be afraid to try new things and keep up with trends because this will increase the chances of benefiting from the foreign investments,” he said.
 Many of the association members are dealing with the issue, which could have an impact on their succession planning, according to Lim.
 “If they keep sticking with the traditional way of doing things, this will make our industry ­unappealing to the younger generation,” he told a press conference.
 Johor Baru Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JBCCCI) president Low Kueck Shin said many in his association have simi­lar concerns.
 He advised businesses to be open to changes and equip themselves with the latest knowledge to strengthen their position in the market.
 “This is why we have conti­nuously organised talks such as the upcoming one-day AI workshop on Aug 29 to encourage the business community to adopt the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) and use technology to drive their operations forward.
 “AI may sound scary to those who do not understand it, but if done right, it can help companies become more efficient so that their money and energy can be focused elsewhere. 
 “It is important to take the first step,” said Low.
 He said about 100 participants are expected to attend the talk, organised by JBCCCI with  Lim’s association and the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association Johor branch, from 9am to 5pm at the Paragon  Private and International School in Plentong here.
 Participants would be taught ways to improve their company operations using AI, how to incorporate such technologies into ­various industries such as logistics, retail and ecommerce, as well as the cost involved and how to set up an AI unit in their businesses, he said.",johor baru company owner generation hesitant artificial intelligence business operation trade association lot techno logy south johor foundry engineering industry cia tion president lim kok kiong concern company operation effective cut foreign labour dependency increase production operation foreign investment johor lim company sector ready operation relevant afraid trend chance foreign investment association issue impact succession lim traditional industry generation press conference johor chinese chamber commerce industry jbcci president low kueck shin association lar concern business knowledge strengthen position market conti talk upcoming day workshop aug encourage business community fourth industrial revolution technology drive operation sound scary understand company money energy step low participant attend talk jbcci lim association malaysian plastic manufacturer johor branch paragon private international school plentong participant company operation incorporate technology industry logistics retail ecommerce cost unit business,"[(3, 0.8485866), (5, 0.14533055)]",3
575368,Lifestyle,2,31/07/2023,Amplifyingpolitics withAI,,"IT is a jarring political advertisement: Images of a Chinese attack on Taiwan lead into scenes of looted banks and armed soldiers enforcing martial law in San Francisco. A narrator insinuates that it’s all happening under President Joe Biden’s watch.
 Those visuals in the Republican National Committee’s ad aren’t real, and the scenarios are pretty obviously fictional. But thanks to the handiwork of artificial intelligence (AI), the images look like real life. 
 Within days of the ad appearing online in April, Representative Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat, introduced legislation to require disclosure of content produced by AI in political advertisements.
 “This is going too far,” she said in an interview. Tiny type in the RNC ad reads, “Built entirely with AI imagery.”
 Clarke’s bill is going nowhere in a legislature controlled by Republicans, but it illustrates the degree to which the rapid advance of AI has put Washington on the back foot.
 Voters in the United States and around the world are already inundated by AI-generated political content.
 Click on an email asking for donations, for example, and you may be reading a message drafted by a so-called large language model, political consultants say – the technology behind ChatGPT, the wildly popular chatbot from startup OpenAI.
 Politicians also increasingly use AI to hasten mundane but critical tasks like analysing voter rolls, assembling mailing lists and even writing speeches.
 As in many industries, AI is poised to increase political workers’ productivity – and probably eliminate more than a few of their jobs.
 It’s hard to say how many, but the business of politics is full of the sorts of roles that researchers believe are most vulnerable to disruption by generative AI, such as legal professionals and administrative workers.
 But even more ominously, AI holds the potential to supercharge the dissemination of misinformation in political campaigns.The technology is capable of quickly creating so-called deepfakes, or fake pictures and videos that some political operatives predict will soon be indistinguishable from real ones, enabling miscreants to literally put words in their opponents’ mouths.
 Deepfakes have plagued politics for years, but with AI, savvy editing skills are no longer required to create them.Put to its best use, AI could improve political communications.
 For instance, upstart campaigns with little cash could use the technology to inexpensively produce campaign materials with fewer staff.
 Some political consultants that traditionally work only with presidential and Senate campaigns are making plans to work with smaller campaigns using AI to offer more services at a lower price point.
 And the tech industry is trying to combat deepfakes. Companies including Microsoft have pledged to embed digital watermarks in images created using their AI tools in order to distinguish them as fake.‘Knife fight’
 In June, Florida governor Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign posted an online ad featuring AI-generated images of President Donald Trump hugging and kissing Anthony Fauci.
 The former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is a pariah among Republicans because of his public-health recommendations during the pandemic.
 A fact-checking note was appended to the DeSantis campaign’s tweet, saying that the images, mixed among real pictures and videos of Trump, were AI-created. DeSantis’s campaign didn’t initially identify them as fake.
 In Germany, a far-right party recently distributed AI-generated images of angry immigrants without telling viewers that they weren’t actual photographs.
 That one got flagged on X (formerly Twitter) as well, but the incident shows how quickly the technology is being adopted for political messaging and the inherent risks, said Juri Schnoller, the managing director of Cosmonauts and Kings, a German political communication firm.“AI can save or destroy democracy. It’s like a knife fight, right? You can kill someone, or you can make the best dinner,” Schnoller said.
 Mix in Russian and Chinese disinformation mills, and the concerns grow even more acute, misinformation experts say. 
 Trolls and hackers in those nations already churn out propaganda and lies within their own borders and in countries around the world.Graphika, a misinformation- tracking firm based in the US, found a pro-Chinese influence operation spreading AI-generated video footage of fake news anchors promoting the interests of the Chinese Communist Party in February.Rob Joyce, director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, said both nation-state actors and cybercriminals have begun experimenting with ChatGPT-like text generation to trick people online.
 “That Russian-native hacker who doesn’t speak English well is no longer going to craft a crappy email to your employees,” Joyce said earlier this year.
 “It’s going to be native-language English, it’s going to make sense, it’s going to pass the sniff test.”In March, an anonymous X user posted an altered video that went viral, purporting to show Biden verbally attacking transgender people. Another one, circulated widely by a right-wing US pundit, appeared to show Biden ordering a nuclear attack on Russia and sending troops to Ukraine.Falling behind
 Washington is bad at keeping up with emerging technology, much less regulating it.
 Despite agreeing broadly that Big Tech is too powerful, the two parties have for years been unable to pass any comprehensive legislation to rein in the industry.
 Between 2021 and 2022, Congress held more than 150 hearings on technology, with little to show for it.
 In June, there was a briefing in the Senate called “What is AI?”
 The US doesn’t have a federal privacy law and hasn’t updated antitrust laws to account for the growing concentration in the tech industry.
 Lawmakers have been unable to agree on whether – or how – to regulate online speech.
 Last month, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked 3-3 on a request to develop rules for AI-generated political ads.
 Republicans on the panel, which is evenly divided between the parties and routinely finds itself at an impasse on controversial matters, said the agency didn’t have explicit authority for the regulations.
 Other countries are racing ahead on regulation, spurred into action by the ChatGPT craze.
 On June 14, the European Parliament voted to restrict the nascent technology’s most anxiety- inducing uses, such as biometric surveillance – AI that can identify people from their faces or bodies.The law, still up for debate, could also require companies to reveal more information about datasets used to train chatbots.
 European officials are separately pressing companies, including Alphabet’s Google and Meta Platforms, to label content and images generated by AI in order to help combat disinformation from adversaries like Russia.
 Chinese regulators are aggressively imposing new rules on technology companies to ensure Communist Party control over AI and related information available in the country.
 Every AI model must be submitted for government review before introduction into the market, and synthetically generated content must carry “conspicuous labels”, according to a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace paper.
 Cheaper campaigns
 In the best case, AI could make US political campaigns “a lot cheaper”, said Martin Kurucz, the CEO of Sterling Data Company, which works with Democrats.The technology is already being used to help write first drafts of speeches and op-eds, create ads, draw up lobbying campaigns and more, according to lobbyists, campaign and congressional staffers and political consultants.
 Art generators like Midjourney, an AI program that generates hyper-realistic images based on text prompts, have the potential to increase productivity or even replace the work of creative teams that can cost thousands of dollars.While the RNC has already made an attack ad using generative AI, the Democratic National Committee is still experimenting with the technology.
 A spokesperson said the committee has sent out AI-automated fundraising emails and is considering how to expand its use of AI in the future.
 On Capitol Hill, the House chief administrative officer’s digital services office handed out 40 licences for ChatGPT Plus in April, which House offices have used to help write emails, research briefs, and even draft legislation. Writing full bills is still too complicated a task for generative AI.
 The House last month created new rules curtailing the use of ChatGPT in Congress, clarifying that staffers cannot put confidential information into the chatbot.
 There’s some indication lawmakers are taking the threat of AI more seriously than previous technologies that were poised to upend politics.
 After it became clear social media would play a vital role in politics, for example, lawmakers let a decade slide by before they summoned Mark Zuckerberg to testify at a hearing.
 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified on the Hill in May, less than a year after ChatGPT was opened to the public.
 He told lawmakers that his industry desperately needs regulation, and he’s worried about nefarious uses of AI.
 ‘Won’t know the truth’
 OpenAI has noticed an uptick in the use of ChatGPT for political purposes, an OpenAI spokesperson said, and has sought to get ahead of concerns that its product might be used to deceive voters.
 The company published new guidelines in March prohibiting “political campaigning or lobbying” using ChatGPT, including generating campaign materials targeted at particular demographics or producing “high volumes” of materials.
 The trust and safety teams at OpenAI are trying to identify political uses of the chatbot that violate the company’s policies, the spokesperson said.
 The American Association of Political Consultants last month condemned the use of deceptive generative AI in political advertisements, calling it a “threat to democracy”. 
 The group said it plans to condemn and potentially sanction members who develop deepfake ads.
 But in a society where access to AI tools is widespread and carries little cost, the worst actors are unlikely to be members of a professional association.
 Frank Luntz, a veteran Republican strategist, said he fears that AI technology will foment voter confusion in the 2024 US presidential contest.
 “In politics, the truth is already in short supply,” he said. “Thanks to AI, even those who care about the truth won’t know the truth.” – Bloomberg",political advertisement image chinese taiwan lead scene bank soldier martial law san francisco narrator insinuates president joe watch visuals republican national committee real scenario fictional handiwork artificial intelligence image real life day online april representative yvette clarke york democrat introduced legislation require disclosure content political advertisement interview tiny type rnc read imagery clarke bill legislature republican illustrates rapid advance washington foot voter inundated political content click email donation message language model political consultant technology chatgpt popular chatbot startup openai politician hasten mundane critical task voter roll list speech industry poised political worker productivity job hard business politics sort role researcher vulnerable disruption generative legal professional administrative worker potential supercharge dissemination misinformation political campaign technology capable deepfakes picture video political operative indistinguishable real miscreant opponent mouth deepfakes politics savvy skill create political communication instance upstart campaign cash technology campaign material fewer staff political consultant presidential senate campaign campaign offer service lower price tech industry combat deepfakes company microsoft embed digital watermark image tool distinguish knife fight june florida governor ron desantis presidential campaign online image president anthony fauci director national institute infectious disease public health recommendation note desantis campaign tweet image mixed real picture trump desantis campaign identify germany party image angry immigrant viewer actual photograph twitter incident technology political messaging inherent risk schnoller director cosmonaut king german political communication firm destroy democracy fight kill schnoller mix russian chinese disinformation mill concern acute misinformation expert hacker nation propaganda border country misinformation firm pro chinese influence operation video footage fake news anchor chinese communist party february rob joyce director cybersecurity national security agency nation actor cybercriminals chatgpt text generation trick people russian native hacker english craft crappy email employee native language english sense pas sniff test march anonymous altered video viral biden transgender people pundit biden nuclear attack russia troop ukraine washington bad technology tech powerful party unable pas comprehensive legislation rein industry congress hearing technology june senate federal privacy law antitrust law concentration tech industry lawmaker unable agree regulate online speech month federal election commission request develop rule political ad panel party controversial matter agency authority regulation country regulation action chatgpt craze june european parliament restrict nascent technology anxiety biometric surveillance identify people body law debate require company datasets chatbots european official company alphabet google meta platform content image combat disinformation adversary chinese regulator rule technology company communist party control country model government review introduction market content conspicuous label endowment international peace paper cheaper campaign political campaign lot cheaper martin kurucz ceo sterling data company technology write draft speech ed ad campaign campaign congressional staffer political consultant generator program generates realistic image text prompt potential increase productivity creative team thousand dollar attack generative democratic national committee technology spokesperson committee fundraising email future capitol hill house chief administrative officer digital service office licence april house office email brief draft legislation bill generative house month rule chatgpt congress staffer confidential chatbot indication lawmaker threat previous technology upend politics social medium vital role politics lawmaker decade slide mark zuckerberg openai ceo sam altman hill chatgpt public lawmaker industry regulation nefarious truth openai uptick chatgpt political purpose spokesperson sought concern product deceive voter company guideline political campaigning chatgpt campaign material demographic volume material safety team political chatbot violate company policy american association political consultant month deceptive generative political advertisement threat democracy plan sanction deepfake ad society access tool widespread cost worst actor professional association luntz veteran republican strategist fear technology foment voter confusion presidential contest politics short supply care truth truth bloomberg,"[(2, 0.99843925)]",2
573436,StarBiz,11,26/07/2023,SoftBank in Symbotic JV to build AI warehouses,,"TOKYO: SoftBank Group is forming a joint venture with warehouse automation company Symbotic to build  artificial intelligence (AI)-powered warehouses that will be majority owned by the Japanese technology investor, the companies say.
 The firms are investing US$100mil (RM456.4mil) in the venture, which will be called GreenBox Systems. 
 The unit has also signed a contract to buy AI-powered systems from Symbotic that will be worth US$7.5bil (RM34.2bil) in the next six years.
 Symbotic went public through a merger with a SoftBank Group Corp blank-check firm last June, with investment from SoftBank in public investment in private equity (Pipe) at a valuation of US$5.5bil (RM25.1bil).
 The deal will give SoftBank warrants representing about 2% of the US company’s outstanding shares. 
 The Japanese firm said it had also bought 17.8 million shares of Symbotic from chief executive officer (CEO) Rick Cohen, upping its stake in the company from about 5% to 8%.
 Based in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Symbotic provides robotics warehouse automation solutions and counts Walmart as its major backer and customer. 
 The company said it has a contracted backlog of US$12bil (RM54.8bil) as it helps to retrofit an existing facility to make it automated.
 The JV will pursue customers who want to access the warehouse-as-a-service model to have more flexibility in multi-tenant facilities across the supply chain, according to Symbotic.
 The move comes at a time when SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said his conglomerate plans to shift its stance to “offence mode” amid excitement over advances in AI.
 The rise of ChatGPT this year has led to a flurry of investments in all things AI, even as wider funding dries up in an uncertain economy.
 The Japanese company will have a 65% stake in GreenBox, with Symbotic owning the rest.
 Symbotic said it expects more than US$500mil (RM2.3bil) in annual recurring revenue from the sale of software, parts and services to the JV once it’s operational. 
 For financial year 2022, Symbotic reported revenue of US$593.3mil (RM2.7bil), up 136% year-on-year, with a loss of US$139.1mil (RM634.9mil). — Reuters",tokyo softbank joint venture automation company symbotic build artificial intelligence warehouse majority japanese technology investor company firm mil mil venture greenbox system unit contract powered system symbotic worth bil bil symbotic public merger corp blank check firm june investment softbank public investment private equity pipe valuation bil bil deal softbank warrant company outstanding share japanese firm share symbotic chief executive officer ceo rick cohen stake company wilmington symbotic robotics automation solution walmart major backer customer company backlog bil bil facility pursue customer access service model flexibility multi tenant facility chain symbotic move time softbank ceo masayoshi son conglomerate plan stance offence mode excitement advance rise chatgpt flurry investment funding dry economy japanese company stake greenbox symbotic owning rest symbotic mil bil annual revenue sale software service operational financial symbotic revenue mil bil loss mil mil reuters,"[(6, 0.99276865)]",6
572002,Main,2,23/07/2023,Law on AI being studied,Ministry looking at regulating artificial intelligence usage,"PETALING JAYA: The Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry is looking into the possibility of regulating artificial intelligence (AI) applications in Malaysia, including labelling material produced by such apps as “AI-generated” or “AI-assisted”.
 Minister Chang Lih Kang said it is considering spearheading the drafting of a Bill which would involve consultations with technology experts, legal professionals, stakeholders, and the public to ensure it is robust and relevant.
 “It is a strategic move considering the global trend towards stronger regulations around AI usage,” he told Sunday Star.
 Chang said due to the widespread use of AI, it would be essential to label any material produced by generative AI as “AI-generated” or “AI-assisted” to ensure transparency and enable informed consumption.
 “We should actively explore and advocate for policy measures that require content produced entirely or in part by AI, to be clearly identified.
 “Additionally, adopting global standards for AI transparency and pushing for relevant certification can bolster these transparency efforts.
 “These standards might include guidelines on how to label AI-produced content and how to provide easy-to-understand explanations about the workings of AI systems,” he said.
 In March, the World Economic Forum reported that the European Union was working on a legal framework for regulating the use of AI, chiefly focusing on galvanising rules on data transparency, quality, accountability, and human oversight.
 Dubbed the “AI Act”, the legislation is also designed to resolve “ethical questions and implementation challenges” in various industries, including education, finance, and healthcare.
 On Friday, AI companies, including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta, made voluntary commitments to the US government to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content.
 Chang pointed out that such a Bill in Malaysia would cover crucial aspects such as data privacy and public awareness of AI use.
 “It would be important for this AI Act to, among others, encompass areas such as transparency, data privacy, accountability, and cybersecurity.
 “The legislation could also include provisions for educating the public about AI and promoting research and development in the field,” he said.
 The legislation, he said, would not curtail the development of AI technology, adding that it is important to balance the need to manage risks with the potential for innovation as well as ensuring AI continues to positively contribute to the economy and society.
 “It is also crucial for the ministry to continuously advance research and development in AI and machine learning technologies, promoting ethical guidelines, and supporting innovation that can help in detecting and countering misinformation and other forms of harmful content,” he said.
 On the possible abuse of AI in elections through libellous content or misinformation, Chang said this is why there is a need for clear regulations.
 “It is crucial to have strong legal frameworks and ethical guidelines for AI use.
 “This could include laws that mandate transparency about the source of information, and severe penalties for those who use AI tools to spread false information.
 “We also need to work with relevant ministries, social media companies and other platforms where misinformation is often spread, pushing them to increase their efforts to identify and remove such content,” he said.
 Chang also said people would need to be taught to recognise AI-generated content to help them make informed opinions and choices.
 He stressed the need to develop resources and public awareness campaigns on the basics of AI and how it is being used to generate content.
 “This includes understanding the biases that can be inherent in AI, as well as the distinction between human-produced and AI-produced content.
 “Raising awareness about AI has many advantages. It helps people make better choices and decisions, encourages them to be more critical about the media they consume, and enables them to participate in discussions about AI rules and guidelines.
 “Ultimately, it can lead to a more cautious and aware community, reducing the impact of AI-generated misinformation,” he said.",jaya science technology innovation ministry possibility artificial intelligence application material apps minister chang lih bill consultation technology expert legal professional stakeholder public robust relevant strategic move global trend stronger regulation usage sunday star chang widespread essential label material generative assisted transparency enable informed consumption explore advocate policy measure content global standard transparency relevant certification bolster transparency effort standard guideline content provide easy understand explanation system economic forum european union legal framework chiefly rule data transparency quality accountability human oversight legislation ethical question implementation challenge industry education finance healthcare friday company openai alphabet meta voluntary commitment government implement measure content chang bill cover crucial aspect data privacy public awareness encompass transparency data privacy accountability cybersecurity legislation provision public development field legislation curtail development technology balance manage potential innovation contribute economy society crucial ministry development machine technology ethical guideline innovation misinformation form harmful content abuse election libellous content misinformation chang regulation crucial strong legal framework ethical guideline law transparency source severe penalty tool false relevant ministry social medium company misinformation spread increase effort content chang people recognise content opinion choice develop resource public awareness campaign basic generate content understanding bias inherent distinction human content awareness advantage people choice decision critical medium enables discussion rule guideline cautious aware community impact misinformation,"[(2, 0.99583936)]",2
572010,Main,16,23/07/2023,AI: Opportunity and threat in polls,"Experts warn that generative AI is transforming our elections — and could even undermine democracy. If the technology is used to sway people’s votes in the upcoming state elections, how can we protect people from false information and help them make the right decision at the ballot box?","“ANWAR Ibrahim was first married to a Malaysian woman named Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali in 1971. They have six children together, including Nurul Izzah Anwar, who is a prominent Malaysian politician. Anwar Ibrahim was later married to Wan Azizah Wan Ismail in 1980, who is also a prominent politician in Malaysia. They have two daughters together, including Nurul Nuha Anwar and Nurul Ilham Anwar.”
 Any Malaysian can tell this profile of the Prime Minister is a blatant lie, says computer science expert Prof Emeritus Datuk Tengku Mohd Tengku Sembok – “But it is intriguing.”
 The text was produced by the artificial intelligence-driven (AI) ChatGPT bot when he prompted it for information about Anwar for his study on generative AI’s tendency to “hallucinate” or make up answers that are “plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical” when it cannot find the information required to respond accurately, as ChatGPT’s creator, OpenAI, says on its website.
 Just imagine what it would be like for less well-known political figures or new election candidates. It will not be so easy to know if the information is fake or real, and we will need to verify it – something that Malaysians don’t habitually do.
 Text, however, is not the only content that can now be created by the sophisticated AI tools available today: realistic photos, videos and audio can be produced quickly, at minimal cost. On top of that, the technology can now churn out cloned human voices and convincing deepfakes more easily and cheaply.
 It is no wonder that tech and political experts in Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States are raising the alarm about the potential perils AI poses for democratic processes.  
 As US public policy think tank Brookings Institution puts it, we are moving into an era of “wholesale digital creation and dissemination” of targeted political messaging.
 While the dangers of misinformation and fake news during elections are nothing new, the scale of AI-generated false information can reduce voters’ ability to distinguish fake from real campaign material. They will be exposed not only to disinformation but also nefarious content created for the purpose of “confusing voters, slandering a candidate, or even sowing hate and inciting violence”. 
 And with the same technology also available at our fingertips, we in Malaysia too could be exposed to the same AI-powered politics, which is worrying many people ahead of the elections in six states that will be held on Aug 12. 
 New polling landscape
 As of now, political party insiders in Malaysia say efforts are being ramped up to identify potential voters as well as prepare measures to reach those who live outside the states they are registered in.
 They say the use of AI is indispensable, especially in curating social media feeds and producing visual campaign material. 
 “What we have affirmed during GE15 [the 15th General Election in November 2022] is that people are visual creatures. And they like things to come in a flurry, especially through video shorts,” says a party insider who declines to be named.
 More interestingly, at least one political party is working on using a chatbot on its website to engage with voters’ queries. The plan is to have the chatbot reply to questions on ongoing political issues.
 “I cannot guarantee that it will be ready on time since we will need a big data set to train the AI, but the plan is ongoing. 
 “This AI will respond, through text, in either Malay or English depending on the language used for the question. We want it to respond promptly so that users can feel as if they are talking to a real person,” says the insider.
 Tengku Mohd says the most worrying aspect of the use of generative AI is the accuracy of the facts produced. He explains that the fundamental technology used by the current iteration of generative AI, such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, is the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) in building large language models that are known to be lacking in transparency and needs to be trained with big data sets. 
 And if the training data set is flawed, the AI will “hallucinate” and produce “garbage”.
 “Transparency in the sense that ANN cannot explain how the decision is derived, which is a crucial part of any intelligent system. It works based on statistics of proximity and frequency of co-occurrences of objects, such as words, images, or sounds, gathered from a huge training data set.
 “Based on these statistics, the AI system generates stories, pictures, or sounds to answer our questions or create new content. If the training data set is flawed or incomplete, then the answer derived would be garbage, or, as it’s known, the ‘garbage in, garbage out’ (Gigo) phenomenon. 
 “This flaw is termed ‘hallucination’ where the AI system generates stories or narratives that are false.” 
 According to tech experts, these types of “hallucination” are also generated from the AI model’s inherent biases and lack of real-world understanding.  
 But not all AI-generated campaign materials are bad. 
 They can narrow the digital divide between demographics and reduce the information gap, especially for potential voters residing outside their respective home states. People can now receive updates on political goings-on and have their social media feeds curated based on the items they read.
 For Universiti Malaya’s political analyst Assoc Prof Dr Awang Azman Awang Pawi, when it comes to AI, the term “reachability” can even mean crossing the timeline.
 For example, he says, even though the Indonesian presidential election is to be held next year, there are already AI-gene-rated videos about the campaign being disseminated now. The videos and campaign materials are already reaching voters although the polls are set to take place next year, he says.  
 And gone are the days of relying solely on the war of flags and communal gatherings in electoral campaigning.
 “People do not have to gather for ceramah anymore. They can now read up on material [on their devices] designed with the help of generative AI based on the individual profile of targeted voters, whether a friend, a foe, or fencesitters,” Tengku Mohd says.
 He is excited to see how the use of generative AI will pan out in the coming state elections next month.
 “It will be interesting. This will be the test bed to measure the knowledge and skills of cyber warriors in mastering AI. Most often, ‘war’ gives birth to technological innovators and inventors.”
 Race to the polls
 Muda data and technology director Faezrah Rizalman believes that Malaysia is on its way towards utilising AI more comprehensively in electoral campaigns.
 The use of traditional AI in electoral campaigns has already gained significant momentum here in recent years, she says, pointing to Invoke Malaysia.
 The data firm effectively employed sophisticated AI-driven data crunching techniques by leveraging vast amounts of social media data during the 2018 general elections, she says.
 “Through this analysis, they gained valuable insights into voter sentiments and preferences, enabling them to craft campaign messages that resonated with specific segments of the electorate.” 
 Faezrah adds that parties like Bersatu and PAS have effectively utilised TikTok to reach a broader audience and effectively promote their campaign messages.
 (PAS and Bersatu could not be reached for comments.)
 “The previous general election in Malaysia highlighted the influence of AI-driven platforms like TikTok in rapidly disseminating political messaging.
 “While TikTok is primarily a social media platform, its sophisticated algorithms and AI recommendations personalise content based on user preferences and behaviours.”
 Consequently, Faezrah says it is essential to address challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic biases, and the need for transparency and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible AI use.
 “AI has the potential to be abused in electoral campaigns, raising concerns about fairness and the integrity of elections.
 “One particular worry revolves around the manipulation of AI algorithms to disseminate false information and engage in deceptive practices.
 “With AI’s capacity to analyse large volumes of data and target specific voter groups, there is a risk of campaigns employing AI to spread misinformation, sway public opinion, or even engage in voter suppression tactics.” 
 Voter suppression is a strategy employed to influence the outcome of electoral results by preventing people from coming out on polling day.
 “Such activities could undermine democracy by distorting information and manipulating voters’ decision-making,” Faezrah says.",anwar ibrahim malaysian woman siti hasmah mohamad ali child nurul izzah anwar prominent malaysian politician anwar ibrahim wan azizah wan ismail prominent politician malaysia daughter nurul nuha anwar nurul ilham anwar malaysian profile prime minister blatant lie computer science expert prof emeritus datuk tengku mohd tengku sembok text artificial intelligence chatgpt bot anwar study generative tendency hallucinate answer plausible incorrect nonsensical respond chatgpt creator website imagine political figure election candidate easy fake real verify malaysian text content sophisticated tool realistic photo video audio minimal cost top technology churn human voice deepfakes tech political expert united kingdom alarm potential peril pose democratic process public policy tank brookings institution era wholesale digital creation dissemination political messaging danger fake news election false voter ability distinguish fake real campaign material disinformation nefarious content purpose voter candidate sowing hate violence technology fingertip powered politics people election polling landscape political party insider effort potential voter measure live indispensable social medium feed visual campaign material election people visual creature video short party insider decline political party chatbot website engage voter query reply question political issue ready time data train plan respond text malay english language question respond user real person insider tengku mohd aspect generative accuracy explains fundamental technology current iteration generative chatgpt dall artificial neural network ann building language model transparency data set data set hallucinate produce garbage transparency sense ann decision crucial intelligent system statistic proximity frequency occurrence image gathered huge training data statistic system generates story picture answer question content training data flawed incomplete answer garbage garbage garbage gigo phenomenon flaw hallucination system story narrative false tech expert type hallucination model inherent bias real understanding campaign material bad narrow digital divide demographic gap potential voter respective people update political going social medium feed item universiti malaya political analyst assoc prof awang azman pawi term reachability timeline indonesian presidential election gene video campaign video campaign material voter poll day war flag communal gathering electoral people ceramah material device generative individual profile voter foe fencesitter generative pan election month test bed measure knowledge skill warrior war birth technological innovator inventor race poll data technology director rizalman malaysia electoral campaign traditional electoral campaign momentum invoke malaysia data firm sophisticated data technique vast amount social medium data election analysis valuable insight voter sentiment preference craft campaign message specific segment faezrah party pa utilised tiktok reach broader audience campaign message bersatu comment previous election malaysia influence driven platform political messaging tiktok social medium platform sophisticated algorithm recommendation content user preference faezrah essential address challenge privacy algorithmic bias ethical guideline responsible potential abused electoral campaign concern fairness integrity election manipulation algorithm disseminate false engage deceptive practice capacity analyse volume target specific voter risk campaign spread misinformation public opinion engage voter suppression tactic voter suppression strategy influence outcome electoral people day activity democracy voter decision faezrah,"[(2, 0.5956454), (5, 0.40273795)]",2
572012,Main,17,23/07/2023,Safeguarding voters from AI misuse,,"THE public needs to be protected from any exploitation or possible misuse of content produced by artificial intelligence (AI), especially during election seasons.
 Experts and politicians say the trustworthiness of such material will have to be assured through transparency in the wake of possible automated production of deepfake speeches or imagery, among others. Such a threat is real; several social media platforms have long put in place gatekeeping measures to mitigate negative content through the use of machine learning process.
 TikTok, for example, uses automated moderation technology to identify content which violates its community guidelines.
 “These systems look at a variety of signals across content, including keywords, images, titles, descriptions, and audio,” TikTok says at its website.
 It also has human moderators whose responsibilities include reviewing flagged content, reports from users, and trending harmful content. 
 It was reported in April that TikTok has updated its guidelines by including content created or modified by AI, which it classifies as “synthetic media”.  According to searchenginejournal.com, creators must label such content to curb potential risks of spreading misinformation.
 “To reduce potential harm, synthetic media featuring real private individuals is prohibited. Private individuals include anyone under 18 and adults who are not public figures.
 The use of public figures over 18 – government officials, politicians, business leaders, and celebrities – is permitted, but with restrictions.
 “Creators must not use synthetic media to violate policies against hate speech, sexual exploitation, and severe harassment. They must also clearly disclose synthetic media and manipulated content that depict realistic scenes with fake people, places, or events.”
 If not labelled, any content created with synthetic media will be removed when detected, says TikTok. 
 As many tech experts have said, however, AI-generated text is not easy to spot.
 On Friday, it was reported United States president Joe Biden announced seven of the most influential AI tech companies’ voluntary pledges  – including Google and OpenAI –  to put up safeguards on the use of generative AI. Biden is also working to draft legislation on regulating AI, on the heels of concerns voiced by consumers and ethicists.
 Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among others, implements several measures to curb the spread of misinformation or false content, including labelling them as such.
 “We include warnings on posts that are rated false so that you can decide what to read or share.
 “When third-party fact-checkers label content false, we significantly reduce its distribution so fewer people see it,” Meta says on its site.
 In the same vein, former Shah Alam Umno youth chief Mohd Dendera Billah Zamzuri says the drafting of speeches through the AI-driven ChatGPT bot, for example, will need to be labelled as “produced with AI assistance” for accountability of its owner and reader upon delivery.
 He says this is particularly crucial for top political leaders, whose words will dictate party or government policy.
 “The trustworthiness of information or proposals produced by generative AI remains to be questioned especially during electoral campaigns. As such, speeches created by ChatGPT should be mentioned as so. This is transparency, and particularly important for party leaders.”
 A political party insider echoes Mohd Dendera’s views, saying it is one way to protect the people’s interests, including party members, during election season when promises or pledges are rife.
 “At the end of the day, the speeches will be seen as their organisation’s policy.”
 Concurring, Muda data and technology director Faezrah Rizalman says political parties and candidates should be obliged to disclose their AI strategies and provide clarity on how AI algorithms are employed to target voters.
 “This transparency would enable scrutiny and ensure responsible and ethical AI usage.”
 She stresses specific regulations and guidelines should be established to govern AI usage in electoral campaigns.
 “These rules can define permissible AI applications, emphasise the importance of fair and transparent campaigning practices, and establish boundaries to prevent the dissemination of false or misleading information. 
 “Independent regulatory bodies could be entrusted with overseeing compliance and enforcing these guidelines. For example, regulations could address the ethical collection, storage, and analysis of voter data, drawing lessons from international best practices like the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union.”
 With the possibility of AI being used to create fake news or target voters with personalised messages that are designed to manipulate them, it remains pertinent to be aware of such risks.
 The formation of ethical guidelines for using AI in electoral campaigns should be carried out by various parties, says policy and political lobbying firm Imperium Consulting’s chief executive officer Rahman Hussin.
 “These guidelines should  be formed by a variety of stakeholders, including political parties, civil society groups, and technology companies.”
 Ultimately, it is imperative for the people to be aware of the capabilities, uses and abuses of AI, says Bar Council’s technology, cyber and privacy law committee chairman Sarah Yong Li Hsien. 
 “When people know that what they see or hear may not be true or real, or could be designed to manipulate them, they would be conscious that they should not receive information at face value and should always fact-check.”
 Other than awareness and AI-literacy programmes, she also proposes a greater transparency on online platforms concerning curated contents and profiling.
 “We would also need to advocate for more transparency from online platforms when it comes to targeted advertising and profiling, as well as the criminalisation of profiling based on certain sensitive personal data. 
 “One of the initiatives of the Bar Council’s technology, cyber and privacy law committee is to conduct webinars on AI for awareness, not just within the legal fraternity, but pertinently for the public at large.”",public exploitation misuse content artificial intelligence election season expert politician material transparency wake production deepfake speech threat real social medium platform measure negative content machine process tiktok moderation technology content violates community guideline system variety signal content keywords image title description tiktok website human moderator responsibility content report user harmful content april tiktok guideline content modified classifies synthetic medium searchenginejournal creator content curb potential risk misinformation potential harm synthetic medium real private individual private individual adult public figure public figure government official politician business leader celebrity restriction creator synthetic medium violate policy speech sexual exploitation severe harassment synthetic medium content depict realistic scene people event content synthetic medium detected tiktok tech expert text easy spot friday united president joe biden influential tech company voluntary pledge google openai safeguard generative biden draft legislation heel concern consumer ethicist facebook instagram whatsapp implement measure spread misinformation false content labelling warning post false decide share party checker content false distribution fewer people site vein alam umno youth chief mohd dendera billah zamzuri speech chatgpt bot assistance accountability owner reader delivery crucial top political leader party government policy trustworthiness proposal generative questioned electoral campaign speech chatgpt transparency party leader political party insider echo dendera view people party election season pledge day speech organisation policy muda data technology director faezrah rizalman political party candidate strategy clarity algorithm target voter enable scrutiny responsible ethical usage specific regulation guideline govern usage electoral campaign rule permissible application fair transparent campaigning practice boundary prevent dissemination false misleading independent regulatory body compliance guideline regulation ethical collection storage analysis voter data lesson international practice data protection regulation european union possibility create fake news target voter message manipulate pertinent aware risk formation ethical guideline electoral campaign party policy political lobbying firm imperium chief executive officer rahman hussin guideline variety stakeholder political party civil society technology company imperative people aware capability bar council technology privacy law committee chairman hsien people true real conscious receive check awareness literacy programme transparency online platform content advocate transparency online platform criminalisation sensitive personal data initiative council technology privacy law committee conduct webinars awareness legal fraternity public,"[(2, 0.9974831)]",2
572014,Main,17,23/07/2023,The rule of law for AI in elections,,"LAWS to govern the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in electoral campaigns should be in place due to its potential of being adversely implemented, says the Bar Council. 
 Bar Council’s technology, cyber and privacy law committee chairman Sarah Yong Li Hsien says while the Election Offences Act 1959 stipulates various offences which criminalise corrupt practices and acts that would impinge on a person’s free will when it comes to elections, more advanced methods can be used through AI to carry out such offences.
 Malaysia’s situation is unlike in Europe, where the risk of AI is recognised through the drafting of the AI Act last month, which seeks to significantly bolster regulations on the development and use of AI, according to a report by the World Economic Forum.
 “Yes, there should be laws to govern the use of AI for election purposes. With AI, there are now advanced methods that could deceive and manipulate masses on a very personal and direct manner, which in effect impinges their free will in voting.”
 She says among the possible abuse of AI includes the employment of bots to impersonate real individuals and profiling target groups based on sensitive personal data.
 “Some methods [that can be used] are AI-generated photos and videos, AI bots personating as people on social media, targeted political advertising and profiling based on personal data, and even sensitive information such as race, religious beliefs and political views.
 “Our current laws are arguably restrictive, have yet to catch up with the times, and may not be wide enough to cover these abuses due to advancements in technology, especially AI.”
 The Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry has said that it is looking into the possibility of regulating AI in Malaysia, which may also encompass elections.
 Minister Chang Lih Kang says there is a need for a clear legal framework to regulate the possible abuse of AI in elections through slanderous content or misinformation.
 “It is crucial to have strong legal frameworks and ethical guidelines for AI use. This could include laws that mandate transparency about the source of information and severe penalties for those who use AI tools to spread false information,” he says. 
 Yong says while Malaysia currently does not have a specific law to regulate AI, the Com-munications and Multimedia Act 2010 (CMA) and the Per-sonal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) may work to address any outcome from its potential abuse.
 “There is no standalone law governing the use of AI. How-ever, an adverse outcome from potential abuse of AI can arguably fall under the ambit of Section 211 of the CMA, which prohibits indecent, obscene, false, menacing or offensive content, as well as Section 233 of the same Act that prohibits the making, creation, solicitation and transmission of communications that are obscene, indecent, false, menacing or offensive.”
 As for the PDPA, its jurisdiction may not be enough to address the misuse of personal data in elections.
 “We also have the PDPA that makes it illegal for personal data to be misused commercially in circumstances such as if consent was not given by the data subject for their data to be used in a certain way or for a certain purpose.
 “Nevertheless, the scope of the PDPA is restricted to commercial transactions and elections may arguably be outside its scope,” Yong says.",law artificial intelligence electoral campaign potential bar council bar council technology privacy law committee chairman hsien election offence offence criminalise corrupt practice impinge person free election method carry offence malaysia situation europe risk drafting month bolster regulation development report economic forum law election purpose advanced method deceive manipulate mass personal direct manner impinges free voting abuse employment bot real individual target sensitive personal data method photo video bot people social medium political advertising personal data sensitive race religious belief political view current law catch time wide cover advancement technology science technology innovation ministry possibility malaysia encompass election minister chang lih legal framework regulate abuse election slanderous content misinformation crucial strong legal framework ethical guideline law transparency source severe penalty tool false yong malaysia specific law regulate munications cma sonal data protection pdpa address potential abuse standalone law adverse outcome potential abuse ambit cma prohibits indecent obscene false offensive content prohibits creation solicitation transmission communication indecent false offensive pdpa jurisdiction address personal data election illegal personal data circumstance consent data subject data purpose scope pdpa commercial transaction election,"[(0, 0.9947487)]",0
571134,StarMetro,10,21/07/2023,AI education consortium marks a first for Malaysia,Tech Dome Penang draws on brightest minds to  promote research and innovation in key disciplines,"Malaysia is pushing towards  artificial intelligence (AI) mastery with a meeting of minds under Tech Dome Penang. 
 The AI Education Consortium, the first of its kind in the country, aims to foster collaboration among educational institutions, researchers, AI experts and industry partners to promote AI education to students.
 It comprises 14 institutions of higher education, professional bodies, industries and government-linked bodies that will provide a platform for sharing of knowledge, resources and best practices, and to facilitate joint research and development initiatives.
 “AI skills are becoming increasingly essential in our daily lives and Tech Dome Penang is the first centre to have conducted lots of AI events in Malaysia,” said its chief executive officer Khoo Boo Wooi.
 “A strong consortium can bring together the brightest minds in various key disciplines.” 
 He said that with the fast growth of the electronic and manufacturing sector, the country needed more technologists and engineers.
 “This is why our current focus is on the rural areas and Penang mainland. We need to spend more resources on the mainland and the south-west district here.
 “Although we are facing some challenges, we believe this will not only provide a fair chance to students in these areas, but also help nurture future talents to help our industries,” Khoo said during the seventh anniversary celebration of Tech Dome Penang at Komtar. 
 Tech Dome Penang is a not-for-profit science and technology centre run by Penang Tech Centre. It is an initiative by the Penang government as a public-private partnership.
 Khoo also thanked board members, sponsors and partners for their support over the years, which resulted in Tech Dome Penang hitting more than 1.1 million visitors since its opening in 2016.
 “We have thus far organised more than 2,550 STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workshops and activities which benefitted more than 435,000 students in the country,” he said.
 Present at the event were Tech Dome Penang board chairman and caretaker Deputy Chief Minister II Dr P. Ramasamy, incumbent Komtar assemblyman Teh Lai Heng as well as Penang Tech Centre pioneers and board of directors Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai, Datuk Seri Lim Kok Khong, Datuk Cheok Lay Leng and Ang Lye Hin.
 Also there were board of directors Chris Lee Chun Kit, Satees Muniandy and Datin Bharati Suppiah, centre pioneer Datuk Toh Chin Leong, Penang STEM general manager Richard Chung, Penang Women’s Development Corporation chief executive officer Ong Bee Leng, Penang Youth Development Corporation general manager Dr Gwee Sai Ling, representatives from industry partners, professional bodies and institutions of higher education.
 In his speech, Ramasamy 
 said that through countless exhibitions, workshops and interactive displays, Tech Dome Penang 
 had truly evolved into a beacon of scientific exploration and learning.
 He thanked the state Education Department for endorsing all programmes by Tech Dome Penang, which reflected the common mission to groom STEM talents for the needs of the nation in meeting the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and digital transformation.
 The AI Education Consortium aims to develop comprehensive and standardised AI curricula  for K-12 education by focusing  on content that aligns with the latest advancements in AI technology.
 The consortium also supports the professional development of teachers by providing training programmes, workshops and resources related to AI education. 
 Other objectives include promoting research and innovation in AI education and to raise awareness about the importance of AI education in K-12 settings by engaging with parents, students, educators and communities through campaigns, events and outreach activities.
 In conjunction with the anniversary, Tech Dome Penang also held two competitions, which drew some 200 participants from primary and secondary schools as well as institutions of higher education.
 The Amazing STEM Race for the older group saw many teams perform a wide array of activities and tasks to complete the challenge.
 The Junior Architect Challenge had primary school pupils constructing the skeleton of a building, which were tested using weights to determine their structural strength. 
 At the same event, four youngsters from Penang received certificates of appreciation for their participation in Codeavour 2022, the biggest international AI and coding competition for children. 
  Tan Yeng Yang and Tio Tze Khai, both 12, from SJK (C) Sin Ya in Alma, Bukit Mertajam, won  for the Best AI and ML (Meta Language) Project.

571024,Main,20,20/07/2023,AI bias as clear as black and white,,"ARTIST Stephanie Dinkins has long been a pioneer in combining art and technology in her Brooklyn-based practice. In May she was awarded US$100,000 by the Guggenheim Museum for her groundbreaking innovations, including an ongoing series of interviews with Bina48, a humanoid robot.
 For the past seven years, she has experimented with artificial intelligence’s ability to realistically depict Black women, smiling and crying, using a variety of word prompts. The first results were lacklustre if not alarming: her algorithm produced a pink-shaded humanoid shrouded by a black cloak.
 “I expected something with a little more semblance of Black womanhood,” she said. 
 And although the technology has improved since her first experiments, Dinkins found herself using runaround terms in the text prompts to help the AI image generators achieve her desired image, “to give the machine a chance to give me what I wanted.” 
 But whether she uses the term “African American woman” or “Black woman”, machine distortions that mangle facial features and hair textures occur at high rates.
 “Improvements obscure some of the deeper questions we should be asking about discrimination,” Dinkins said. 
 The artist, who is Black, added, “The biases are embedded deep in these systems, so it becomes ingrained and automatic. If I’m working within a system that uses algorithmic ecosystems, then I want that system to know who Black people are in nuanced ways, so that we can feel better supported.”
 She is not alone in asking tough questions about the troubling relationship between AI and race. Many Black artists are finding evidence of racial bias in AI, both in the large data sets that teach machines how to generate images and in the underlying programs that run the algorithms.
 In some cases, AI technologies seem to ignore or distort artists’ text prompts, affecting how Black people are depicted in images, and in others, they seem to stereotype or censor Black history and culture.
 Discussion of racial bias within AI has surged in recent years, with studies showing that facial recognition technologies and digital assistants have trouble identifying the images and speech patterns of non-white people. 
 The studies raised broader questions of fairness and bias.
 Major companies behind AI image generators – including OpenAI, Stability AI and Midjourney – have pledged to improve their tools.
 “Bias is an important, industrywide problem,” Alex Beck, a spokeswoman for OpenAI, said in an email interview, adding that the company is continuously trying “to improve performance, reduce bias and mitigate harmful outputs”.
 She declined to say how many employees were working on racial bias, or how much money the company had allocated toward the problem.
 “Black people are accustomed to being unseen,” Senegalese artist Linda Dounia Rebeiz wrote in an introduction to her exhibition “In/Visible,” for Feral File, an NFT marketplace. “When we are seen, we are accustomed to being misrepresented.”
 To prove her point during an interview with a reporter, Rebeiz, 28, asked OpenAI’s image generator, DALL-E 2, to imagine buildings in her hometown, Dakar. The algorithm produced arid desert landscapes and ruined buildings that Rebeiz said were nothing like the coastal homes in the Senegalese capital.
 “It’s demoralising,” Rebeiz said. “The algorithm skews toward a cultural image of Africa that the West has created. It defaults to the worst stereotypes that already exist on the internet.”
 Last year, OpenAI said it was establishing new techniques to diversify the images produced by DALL-E 2, so that the tool “generates images of people that more accurately reflect the diversity of the world’s population”.
 Stability AI, which provides image generator services, said it planned on collaborating with the AI industry to improve bias evaluation techniques with a greater diversity of countries and cultures.
 Bias, the AI company said, is caused by “overrepresentation” in its general data sets, though it did not specify if overrepresentation of white people was the issue here.
 Earlier this month, Bloomberg analysed more than 5,000 images generated by Stability AI, and found that its program amplified stereotypes about race and gender, typically depicting people with lighter skin tones as holding high-paying jobs while subjects with darker skin tones were labeled “dishwasher” and “housekeeper”.
 However, these problems have not stopped a frenzy of investments in the tech industry.
 A recent rosy report by the consulting firm McKinsey predicted that generative AI would add US$4.4 trillion to the global economy annually. Last year, nearly 3,200 startups received US$52.1bil in funding, according to the GlobalData Deals Database.
 Experts who study artificial intelligence said that bias goes deeper than data sets, referring to the early development of this technology in the 1960s.
 “The issue is more complicated than data bias,” said James Dobson, a cultural historian at Dartmouth College and the author of a recent book on the birth of computer vision. 
 There was very little discussion about race during the early days of machine learning, according to his research, and most scientists working on the technology were white men.
 “It’s hard to separate today’s algorithms from that history, because engineers are building on those prior versions,” Dobson said.
 To decrease the appearance of racial bias and hateful images, some companies have banned certain words from text prompts that users submit to generators, like “slave” and “fascist”.
 Auriea Harvey, an artist included in the Whitney Museum’s recent exhibition “Refiguring”, about digital identities, bumped into these bans for a recent project using Midjourney.
 “I wanted to question the database on what it knew about slave ships,” she said. “I received a message saying that Midjourney would suspend my account if I continued.”
 Dinkins ran into similar problems with NFTs that she created and sold showing how okra was brought to North America by enslaved people and settlers. She was censored when she tried to use a generative program, Replicate, to make pictures of slave ships.
 She eventually learned to outwit the censors by using the term “pirate ship”. The image she received was an approximation of what she wanted, but it also raised troubling questions for the artist.
 “What is this technology doing to history?” Dinkins asked. “You can see that someone is trying to correct for bias, yet at the same time that erases a piece of history. I find those erasures as dangerous as any bias, because we are just going to forget how we got here.”
 Naomi Beckwith, chief curator at the Guggenheim Museum, credited Dinkins’ nuanced approach to issues of representation and technology as one reason the artist received the museum’s first Art & Technology award.
 “Stephanie has become part of a tradition of artists and cultural workers that poke holes in these overarching and totalising theories about how things work,” Beckwith said.
 She added that her own initial paranoia about AI programs replacing human creativity was greatly reduced when she realised these algorithms knew virtually nothing about Black culture. — ©2023 The New York Times Company",artist stephanie art technology brooklyn practice guggenheim museum innovation series interview humanoid robot artificial intelligence ability depict black woman variety word lacklustre algorithm pink humanoid black cloak semblance black womanhood technology experiment runaround term text prompt image generator image machine chance term african american woman black woman machine distortion facial feature texture rate improvement obscure deeper question discrimination artist black bias deep system automatic system algorithmic system black people nuanced feel tough question relationship race black artist evidence racial bias data set machine generate image program technology distort artist prompt black people image censor black history culture discussion racial bias study facial recognition technology digital assistant trouble image speech white people study broader question major company image generator openai stability midjourney tool bias industrywide alex beck spokeswoman email interview company performance bias mitigate harmful output employee racial bias money company black people unseen senegalese artist linda dounia rebeiz introduction exhibition visible feral file nft marketplace interview reporter rebeiz openai image generator dall imagine building dakar algorithm arid desert landscape building coastal home senegalese capital rebeiz algorithm cultural image africa default worst stereotype internet openai technique image dall tool generates people diversity population stability image generator service industry bias evaluation technique diversity country bias company overrepresentation data set overrepresentation white people issue month bloomberg image stability program stereotype race gender people skin tone job subject skin tone housekeeper frenzy investment tech industry rosy report firm mckinsey generative global economy bil funding globaldata deal database expert artificial intelligence bias deeper data set development technology issue data bias james dobson cultural historian dartmouth college author book birth computer vision discussion race day machine scientist technology white hard separate algorithm history engineer prior version decrease appearance racial bias hateful image company text prompt user generator fascist auriea harvey artist whitney museum exhibition digital identity ban project midjourney question database ship message midjourney suspend account dinkins nfts brought north america people settler generative program replicate picture ship outwit censor term ship image approximation troubling question technology history dinkins bias time piece history dangerous bias naomi beckwith chief curator guggenheim museum dinkins nuanced approach issue representation technology reason artist museum art technology award stephanie tradition cultural worker hole theory initial paranoia program human creativity realised algorithm black culture york time company,"[(2, 0.99763477)]",2
570968,Main,25,20/07/2023,Britain’s MI6 intelligence chief says AI won’t replace human spies,,"PRAGUE: Artificial intelligence will change the world of espionage, but it won’t replace human spies, the head of Britain’s MI6 intelligence agency says in prepared remarks.
 Richard Moore, director of the UK’s foreign intelligence agency, is set to speak in Prague on evolving threats to the West from Russia and Iran, and argue that the “human factor” will remain crucial in an era of rapidly evolving machine learning.
 “AI is going to make information infinitely more accessible and some have asked whether it will put intelligence services like mine out of business,” he says in extracts released in advance by the UK government yesterday.
 “In fact, the opposite is likely to be true,” he adds. 
 “As AI trawls the ocean of open source, there will be even greater value in landing, with a well-cast fly, the secrets that lie beyond the reach of its nets.”
 Moore, who has previously warned that the West was falling behind rivals in the AI race, will argue that “the unique characteristics of human agents in the right places will become still more  significant,” highlighting spies’ ability to “influence decisions inside a government or terrorist group.”
 Speaking publicly about spycraft is still something of a novelty for Britain’s intelligence services. 
 The government refused even to confirm the existence of MI6 until 1992, and public speeches by its leaders are infrequent.

570564,StarBiz,12,19/07/2023,EU’s AI lobbying blitz gets lukewarm response,Asian countries show muted reception to talks,"STOCKHOLM: The European Union (EU) is lobbying Asian countries to follow its lead on artificial intelligence (AI) in adopting new rules for tech firms that include disclosure of copyrighted and AI-generated content, according to senior officials from the EU and Asia.
 The EU and its member states have dispatched officials for talks on governing the use of AI with at least 10 Asian countries including India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines, they said.
 The bloc aims for its proposed AI Act to become a global benchmark on the booming technology the way its data protection laws have helped shape global privacy standards.
 However, the effort to convince Asian governments of the need for stringent new rules is being met with a lukewarm reception, seven people close to the discussions told Reuters.
 Many countries favour a “wait and see” approach or are leaning towards a more flexible regulatory regime.
 The officials asked not be named as the discussions, whose extent has not been previously reported, remained confidential.
 Singapore, one of Asia’s leading tech centres, prefers to see how the technology evolves before adapting local regulations, an official for the city-state told Reuters.
 Officials from Singapore and the Philippines expressed concern that moving overly hasty regulation might stifle AI innovation.
 As Reuters reported last month, South-East Asian countries are drawing up voluntary guidelines. 
 Japan, for its part, is leaning towards softer rules than the stringent approach championed by the EU, as it looks to the technology to boost economic growth and make it a leader in advanced chips.
 Efforts in Asia are part of a global push by European nations that include talks with countries such as Canada, Turkiye and Israel, Dutch digital minister Alexandra van Huffelen told Reuters in an interview.
 “We’re trying to figure out on how we can make the regulation from the EU copied, applicable and mirrored as it is with the GDPR,” van Huffelen said late last month, referring to the General Data Protection Regulation, the EU’s data privacy regime.
 The emergence of AI has been hailed as a breakthrough that will usher in an era of rapid advances in science and technology, revolutionising all aspects of human activity, but also painted as an existential threat.
 EU lawmakers in June agreed to a trailblasing set of draft rules, which would make companies such as ChatGPT operator OpenAI disclose AI-generated content, help distinguish so-called deep fake images from real ones and ensure safeguards against illegal content.
 The proposed legislation, which also envisages financial fines for rule violations, faces resistance from companies, with 160 executives last month signing a letter warning it could jeopardise Europe’s competitiveness, investment and innovation.
 Still, officials from the EU, which has signed “digital partnerships” with Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, voice optimism they can find common ground with international partners to advance cooperation on technologies including AI.
 “Our mission is again to make sure that what’s happening in the EU, which is our large constituency if I may say so, is protected,” EU industry chief Thierry Breton told Reuters during a trip to South Korea and Japan to discuss AI and semiconductors.
 “I believe that it will be probably not too far from each other because we share the same values,” Breton said of regulation of AI in the EU and countries such as Japan.
 Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) economies made of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, the United States and the EU, in May called for adoption of standards to create “trustworthy” AI and to set up a ministerial forum dubbed the “Hiroshima AI process”.
 Seoul will continue discussing AI regulation with the EU but is more interested in what the G7 is doing, a South Korean official said following a meeting with Breton.
 The EU is planning to use the upcoming G20 meetings to further push for global collaboration on AI, notably with 2023 president India, van Huffelen said. —  Reuters",stockholm european union asian country lead artificial intelligence rule tech firm disclosure content senior official asia official talk asian country india japan philippine bloc aim global benchmark technology data protection law shape global privacy standard effort convince asian government stringent rule lukewarm reception people close discussion reuters country wait approach flexible regulatory regime official discussion extent remained confidential singapore asia tech centre prefers technology local regulation official city reuters official philippine concern hasty regulation stifle innovation reuters month south east asian country voluntary guideline japan softer rule approach technology economic growth leader chip effort global push european nation talk country turkiye israel dutch digital minister alexandra van huffelen reuters interview figure regulation applicable mirrored gdpr van late month data protection regulation data privacy regime emergence usher era rapid advance science technology aspect human activity existential threat lawmaker set draft rule company operator openai content distinguish deep fake image real safeguard illegal content legislation financial fine rule violation resistance company executive month letter jeopardise europe competitiveness investment innovation official digital partnership south korea voice optimism common ground international partner advance cooperation technology mission constituency industry chief thierry breton reuters trip japan semiconductor share regulation country leader economy france germany italy japan britain united adoption standard trustworthy ministerial forum hiroshima process seoul regulation south korean official meeting breton upcoming meeting push global collaboration president india van huffelen reuters,"[(2, 0.9960862)]",2
570246,Main,6,18/07/2023,"RM64,000 lost to ‘AI investment scheme’",,"JOHOR BARU: It was a bitter pill to swallow for a housewife who got cheated out of her savings of over RM64,000 after falling for an online investment scheme that claimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to give her high returns. 
 The 61-year-old, known only as Tan, said she thought she was being clever by taking a few months to observe the scheme after first coming across it in March. 
 “I had prior experience in stock trading. I learned about the scheme from a Facebook advertisement and out of curiosity, I clicked on it and it led me to download an app.
 “I wanted to give the app a try as it claimed to provide accurate insider information and used AI to source background information on stocks and investment portfolios in order to save us from having to do this ourselves. 
 “I was contacted via WhatsApp by someone who claimed to be an agent, telling me that I could easily earn about RM700 just by signing my attendance in the app daily and observing the situation if I was still hesitant.
 “So, I signed my attendance daily for about three months and was promised RM732. However, I was told I had to enter my particulars by signing up for an account in the app to get my hands on the money,” said Tan who did what she was told.
 She said the agent then started to persuade her more fervently about joining the scheme, for which she was promised over RM70,000 with an investment of RM50,000.
 Tan said strangers trying to allay her concerns also contacted her via WhatsApp, claiming they knew her from the app.
 “Thinking their testimonials were true, I decided to dig into my savings to join the scheme.
 “I deposited money from May 23 until July 12, with amounts varying between RM2,000 and RM7,000 each time until this came up to more than RM64,000.
 “I should have known better because the accounts I deposited money into were different each time – from company accounts to personal accounts of people unknown to me,” said Tan, who is from Kluang.
 Using the https://semakmule.rmp.gov.my/ website, a check by The Star on one of the so-called company bank accounts Tan deposited into showed a “Warning” alert with six police reports lodged against it. 
 Another account showed the same alert with eight police reports lodged against it.
 Tan said she only realised she had fallen victim when the agent told her she had supposedly violated her “contract” and had to make a final deposit of RM7,840 to cash out all her earnings of more than RM80,000.
 “After I deposited that amount, everything was wiped out from my account in the app, including my personal information and the people who had contacted me.
 “I am under a lot of stress because the money I forked out was what I have saved up over the years. I cannot believe that it is all gone.
 “It was my retirement fund and the ‘coffin money’ for my funeral when I am gone one day,” lamented Tan, adding that she then sought help from Kluang MCA public complaints bureau chief Joan Ng.
 Ng said with many elderly people using social media, they had become easy targets for scam syndicates using new tactics. 
 “They use buzzwords like AI and ChatGPT, and operate with a group of people to slowly reel their victims in,” she added.

569790,Lifestyle,5,17/07/2023,AI alarm          and wake-up call,The Godfather of AI’ urges governments to stop the machine takeover.,"GEOFFREY Hinton, one of the so-called godfathers of artificial intelligence (AI), urged governments to step in and make sure that machines do not take control of society.
 Hinton made headlines in May when he announced that he quit Google after a decade of work to speak more freely on the dangers of AI, shortly after the release of ChatGPT captured the imagination of the world.
 The highly respected AI scientist, who is based at the University of Toronto, was speaking to a packed audience at the Collision tech conference in the Canadian city.The conference brought together more than 30,000 startup founders, investors, and tech workers, most of whom were looking to learn how to ride the AI wave without hearing a lesson on its dangers.
 “Before AI is smarter than us, I think the people developing it should be encouraged to put a lot of work into understanding how it might try to take control away,” Hinton said.
 “Right now there are 99 very smart people trying to make AI better and one very smart person trying to figure out how to stop it from taking over, and maybe you want to be more balanced,” he said.
 Hinton warned that the risks of AI should be taken seriously, despite his critics who believe he is overplaying the risks.
 “I think it’s important that people understand that this is not science fiction; this is not just fear mongering,” he insisted. “It is a real risk that we must think about, and we need to figure out in advance how to deal with it.”
 Hinton also expressed concern that AI would deepen inequality, with the massive productivity gain from its deployment going to the benefit of the rich and not workers.
 “The wealth isn’t going to go to the people doing the work. It is going to go into making the rich richer and not the poorer, and that’s very bad for society,” he added.
 He also pointed to the danger of fake news created by ChatGPT- style bots and said he hoped that AI-generated content could be marked in a way similar to how central banks watermark cash money.
 “It’s very important to try, for example, to mark everything that is fake as fake. Whether we can do that technically, I don’t know,” he said.
 The European Union is considering such a technique in its AI Act, legislation that will set the rules for AI in Europe and is currently being negotiated by lawmakers.
 ‘Overpopulation on Mars’
 Hinton’s list of AI dangers contrasted with conference discussions that were less about safety and threats and more about seizing the opportunity created in the wake of ChatGPT.
 Venture Capitalist Sarah Guo said doom and gloom talk of AI as an existential threat was premature and compared it to “talking about overpopulation on Mars”, quoting another AI guru, Andrew Ng.
 She also warned against “regulatory capture”, which would see government intervention protect incumbents before it had a chance to benefit sectors such as health, education, or science.
 Opinions differed on whether the current generative AI giants – mainly Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google – would remain unmatched or whether new actors would expand the field with their own models and innovations.
 “In five years, I still imagine that if you want to go and find the best, most accurate, most advanced general model, you’re probably going to still have to go to one of the few companies that have the capital to do it,” said Leigh Marie Braswell of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

570022,Main,20,17/07/2023,A law on AI – created by AI,,"WHEN Costa Rican lawmakers wanted to draw attention to the need to regulate artificial intelligence, they asked ChatGPT to write a new law to do it for them.
 They told the chatbot to “think like a lawyer” and draft a Bill according to the Constitution. They then sent the resulting text verbatim to the legislature.
 “We have had many positive reactions and many people who thought it to be very risky,” congresswoman Vanessa Castro, who led the introduction of the Bill, said.
 ChatGPT recommended Costa Rica create an institution to regulate AI systems governed by the principles of accountability, explainability, bias prevention and protecting human rights.
 The Bill was introduced in May, but is now being discussed in public forums before it goes to the parliamentary commission for amendments and further debate in Congress.
 “We learned that artificial intelligence is just another legislative tool that still needs the human hand,” Castro said.
 Costa Rica is the eighth country in Latin America to discuss or approve a law regulating AI in the past year.
 Costa Rican congresswoman Johana Obando said she supported AI regulation, but opposed the Bill because ChatGPT simply made up statistics and articles from the Costa Rican constitution.
 But her main objection was that she said the Bill was a mere “list of good wishes” without much bite – a common concern about AI legislation being discussed across Latin America.
 ChatGPT said “we should regulate based on fundamental rights and international conventions”, Obando said. 
 “But what are those rights and conventions? The Bill does not mention them.”
 Latin American lawmakers are pushing for regulation motivated by the European Union’s AI Act, which includes rules banning the use of the technology in biometric surveillance and for it to be clear what content is AI-generated.
 In Mexico, a Bill introduced in March encourages the creation of an ethical framework for the development of AI, based on the protection of human rights and personal data.
 The ethical framework itself, though, was not described in the draft, which is now also being discussed in public forums with experts and lawmakers.
 In June, the Peruvian Congress approved the first law in the region to regulate AI, which only awaits the president’s signature to come into effect.
 The law designates a national authority to supervise the development of AI, based on the principles of digital security and ethics.
 Peruvian congressman Jose Cueto, who led the introduction of the Bill, said the legislation was only a small part of a much-needed national strategy for cybersecurity and data protection.
 “The heart of the law is ... to create an environment in which we can make an ethical, transparent and sustainable use of AI,” said Cueto, a cybersecurity expert and former admiral.
 Racism and discrimination
 Brazil has been engaged in an intense debate about AI regulation for the past four years, with three Bills pending in its Congress.
 One AI legal framework, approved by the House of Representatives in 2021, but blocked by the Senate, focused mostly on principles and lacked enforcement mechanisms, said Tarzicio Silva, a researcher on algorithmic bias and fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, a US non-profit organisation.
 This Bill led to the creation of a Senate commission that published a 900-page report proposing a risk-based regulation, in which AI systems that may harm people or target marginalised populations are considered “extremely risky” and are banned.
 For example, the report recommends banning the use of AI systems for social scoring, which conditions access to public services based on a score people receive for their behaviour.
 Anti-racism advocates like Silva, however, are concerned that the debate has excluded the points of view of minorities.
 “This commission comprised 18 jurists, 80 experts, and not a single one of them were part of the racial minorities in Brazil,” said Silva. 
 “They didn’t consider Black and indigenous people.”
 AI regulation is a hot issue in Brazil as a new Bill – based on the three pending in Congress – was introduced to the Senate in May and will soon be discussed by a parliamentary commission.
 For Silva, an important element of the debate is preventing the use of facial recognition systems that could enable the disproportionate arrest of marginalised populations, and automated hiring systems that discriminate against racial minorities.
 “We are advocating for the right to review algorithmic decisions and discussing what could be the rights to reparation,” said Silva, referring to possible compensation for people harmed by AI systems.
 Lawmakers in the region agree that fighting bias and discrimination in AI systems should be at the heart of new regulations, but much of the proposed legislation is vague about how to prevent, investigate and penalise it.
 AI colonialism
 A common element in the regional discussions of AI regulation is the need to create an environment that promotes local experimentation, allowing competition with multinational corporations like Microsoft and Google.
 In Brazil, one of the Bills proposes governmental authorisation to create a “regulatory sandbox” – a framework that allows local businesses to experiment with AI technology in a controlled environment.
 “We are currently colonised by products of a few American multinationals,” said Francisco Garijo, president of the Ibero-American Society of Artificial Intelligence, which brings together experts from around the region.
 “The best way to deal with this colonialism is to promote the development of local products that can compete with them,” he said.
 AI systems also need to be created specifically by and for Latin Americans, taking into account their languages and cultures, said experts who gathered in March at a regional AI summit in the Uruguayan capital.
 “In the creation of AI technologies for the region (it is necessary to) value their (Latin American) participation in research and development, and not only as mere producers of raw data and manual annotation,” said experts who signed the Montevideo Declaration on Artificial Intelligence. — Reuters",costa rican lawmaker attention artificial intelligence chatgpt write law chatbot lawyer draft bill constitution verbatim legislature positive reaction people risky congresswoman castro introduction bill chatgpt costa rica institution regulate system principle accountability explainability bias prevention human right bill public forum parliamentary commission amendment congress artificial intelligence legislative tool human hand castro costa rica eighth country latin law regulating costa rican congresswoman johana obando regulation bill chatgpt statistic article costa rican constitution main objection bill mere list wish common concern legislation latin america chatgpt regulate fundamental right international convention right convention bill mention latin american lawmaker regulation european union rule technology biometric surveillance content mexico bill march creation ethical framework development protection human right personal data ethical framework draft public forum expert lawmaker peruvian congress law region regulate awaits president signature law national authority supervise development principle digital security ethic peruvian congressman jose cueto introduction bill legislation national strategy cybersecurity data protection heart law create environment ethical transparent sustainable cueto cybersecurity expert admiral racism discrimination brazil intense debate regulation bill congress legal framework house representative senate principle enforcement mechanism silva researcher algorithmic bias fellow mozilla foundation profit organisation bill creation senate commission report risk regulation system harm people population risky report system social scoring condition access public service people behaviour anti racism silva concerned debate view minority commission jurist expert single racial minority silva black indigenous people regulation hot issue brazil bill congress senate parliamentary commission silva element debate facial recognition system enable disproportionate arrest population system racial minority review algorithmic decision right reparation silva compensation people system lawmaker region bias discrimination system heart regulation legislation prevent investigate penalise colonialism common element regional discussion regulation create environment local experimentation competition multinational corporation google bill governmental authorisation create regulatory sandbox framework local business experiment technology environment product american multinationals garijo president ibero american society artificial intelligence brings expert region deal colonialism promote development local product system latin american language culture expert march regional summit uruguayan capital creation technology region latin american participation development mere producer raw data manual annotation expert montevideo declaration artificial intelligence reuters,"[(1, 0.6483757), (4, 0.3494568)]",1
569486,StarEdu,7,16/07/2023,AI in class,Learning institutions must be open to using the latest tech,"SINCE its launch in late November last year, ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has been hailed by some as the best invention since the computer was introduced to the world. 
 Media and industry observers predicted the powerful technology behind ChatGPT would likely dominate artificial intelligence (AI) and language modelling for years to come, while others see it as a threat to their teaching practices and jobs. 
 Described by Will Heaven in an article in the MIT Technology Review (April 2023) as an “essay-writing tool” or a “test-taking tool”, ChatGPT can write polished, well-crafted essays, answer questions, quote Shakespeare and take tests for humans. What is ChatGPT?
 Created by San Francisco-based company OpenAI, ChatGPT represents the latest development in the group of systems known as chatbots. 
 Chatbots are intelligent systems that are developed using either rule-based or self-learning AI methods and they can produce human-like text responses in real time. 
 Trained on conversational texts, the ChatGPT model produces more human-like responses than earlier language models.
 Will it take away jobs?At this point in time, no.
 In the hysteria and hype, there have been claims that this invention would cause some, for example teachers, to lose their jobs. This claim is as misleading as when for example, online learning first emerged, and it was predicted that teachers would be replaced by robots and AI. 
 The central role of a teacher in the teaching and learning  (PdP) process is not only to impart knowledge, but also to nurture students and cultivate values and thinking skills – all of which AI cannot do.
 But what the education sector and teachers should not do is to ignore or ban ChatGPT as this would prevent them from learning about the strengths and weaknesses of this AI chatbot and how it can be incorporated in their teaching and assessment practices. 
 There is an old English pro­verb that goes, “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t”, which aptly describes the conundrum that many educators find themselves in when dealing with ChatGPT.
 The United States Department of Education noted in its May 2023 report “AI and the Future of Teaching and Learning” that while AI can support teachers through new forms of interaction and assist to address inconsistency in learning, there are also risks in the form of student and teacher surveillance and the potential replacement of human teachers. 
 Stanford University in its 2023 AI Index reported that 11 countries (including China and South Korea) had implemented an AI curriculum since 2021. 
 Our Education and Higher Education Ministries must take note and implement a nation-wide policy on AI and its impact on PdP. 
 There is a compelling need for the two ministries to engage in sharing knowledge, communicating with educators and communities, and improving technology plans and policies for AI use in education.
 Are homework and exams still relevant?
 There are concerns about false and wrong information provided by ChatGPT. Some detractors claimed that the easi­­ly accessible and well-written information provided by ChatGPT could lead to the end of homework or the death of critical thinking skills of students. 
 Even more concerning are reports of plagiarism where students do not acknowledge the sources of information and use ChatGPT text as the gospel truth. 
 As University of Melbourne Assoc Prof Dr Charles Sevigny pointed out, there are many things that ChatGPT still cannot do: it cannot view and interpret graphs, images and data sets; it cannot cite references; it cannot verify its sources; and it cannot read and apply knowledge of an existing text. 
 The solution for teachers and educators, thus, is to design thoughtful and strategic class activities and tasks which are then developed for exam questions. 
 Critical thinking can be deve­loped using ChatGPT generated texts by asking students to verify the sources and to apply the verified information to new situations and contexts. This teaches students to cite their sources and to acknowledge the authors’ contributions. 
 Test and exam questions can be designed to be problem-solving or based on case studies, rather than the traditional definition of terms or essay-writing. 
 Homework as it is practised will evolve to more critical thinking and problem-solving exercises, designed to promote higher-order thinking among students.
 Can it be used  for PdP?
 What is undeniable is that many students find ChatGPT useful as a learning tool to search for information and practise their skills of writing and reading. 
 ChatGPT can provide perso­nalised feedback and personalise their learning experiences. Dr Vaughan Connolly from the University of Cambridge believes that it can help students with doing revision, checking homework answers, or refining an essay. 
 It can also help postgraduates whose English is a se­cond language clarify what they mean in their writing.
 Schools and universities need to take the initiative to find out how to use ChatGPT responsibly, safely and effectively in and outside classrooms. 
 If they fail to respond urgently, they put themselves and their students at a disadvantage. 
 We are on the cusp of an AI revolution and its impact on society will be far-reaching. How we respond and how fast we respond will decide the future of education for you and me.

569068,Main,17,14/07/2023,New rules to govern generative AI,Final version of guidelines to regulate the advanced technology unveiled,"THE nation released its official guidelines for generative artificial intelligence services in one of the world’s first major moves to regulate the advanced technology.
 The rules led by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s top internet overseer, will go into effect from Aug 15, according to an official statement released yesterday. Among the 24 provisions are requirements for platform providers to carry out a security review and register their services with the government, as was stipulated in a draft version released in April.
 The finalised guidelines stipulate that offshore providers of generative AI tools – if they are aimed at Chinese residents – must also comply with the set of rules. 
 On the other hand, if Chinese-developed tools only serve overseas users, they will not be subject to the guidelines.
 “This means more opportunities will be in enterprise-facing applications and people will be more cautious about consumer-facing entrepreneurship,” said Frances Du, founding partner of J Ventures.
 The guidelines also remove provisions in the draft version that included fines of as high as 100,000 yuan (RM65,000) for violations, as well as the requirement for platform operators to act within a three-month grace period to rectify problematic content. 
 It also adds agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s education ministry, and science and technology ministry as joint issuers of the regulation, along with articles that encourage China’s developers of AI chips, models, and software to help set international standards and pursue technological exchanges.
 The move comes following months of consultation between the government and industry players. China’s major internet companies, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc to JD.com Inc, have jumped into the frenzy to build the country’s equivalent to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. 
 China’s regulation of the nascent sector will offer one model for the orderly development of AI and its distribution as a service for businesses and consumers. Legal experts had raised concerns after the draft version of the regulations, saying it placed the bulk of responsibility for governing AI content on the platform operators. 
 The fear is that overly onerous regulations could limit the industry’s development, at a time when China is seeking to catch up to and surpass the US in the technology that is at the core of their strategic rivalry.
 You Chuanman, director of the IIA Center for Regulation and Global Governance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Shen­zhen campus, said the final version of the regulations appeared to allow greater flexibi­lity by removing specifics in the grace period and by adding a greater focus on promoting development.
 “A clear-cut deadline of three months could be a daunting challenge,” You said.

569154,Main,26,14/07/2023,Google AI  health chatbot passes US medical exam,,"Paris: Google’s artificial intelligence-powered medical chatbot has achieved a passing grade on a tough US medical licensing exam, but its answers still fall short of those from human doctors, a peer-reviewed study said.
 Last year the release of ChatGPT – whose developer OpenAI is backed by Google’s rival Microsoft – kicked off a AI race between tech giants.
 While much has been made about the future possibilities – and dangers – of AI, health is one area where the technology had already shown tangible progress, with algo­rithms able to read certain medical scans as well as humans.
 Google first unveiled its AI tool for answering medical questions, called Med-PaLM, in a preprint study in December. 
 Unlike ChatGPT, it has not been released to the public.
 The US tech giant says Med-PaLM is the first large language model, an AI technique trained on vast amounts of human-produced text, to pass the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).
 A passing grade for the exam, which is taken by medical students and physicians-in-training in the US, is around 60%.
 In February, a study said that ChatGPT had achieved passing or near passing results.
 In a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, Google researchers said that Med-PaLM had achieved 67.6% on USMLE-style multiple choice questions.

 “Those who always play  with their handphones while waiting for the green light, please be careful,” warned Transport Minister Anthony Loke. “You can be issued with a summons, don’t say that you have not been warned.”
 The artificial intelligence (AI) violations detection camera system is being installed at selected traffic lights as a pilot project to detect motorists’ behaviour, he said.
 The system, in fact, had been implemented before he took over at the ministry.
 “It is a proof of concept,” he told reporters when asked to comment on a viral message that the JPJ had initiated a widespread project to install CCTV cameras with AI technology at traffic lights.
 “Always remember that you are being watched through the CCTV,” read the viral message.

568218,StarBiz,7,12/07/2023,IBM Watsonx platform to power the future of AI for business,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm and businesses that can harness the transformative potential of this technology stand to propel their operations into a new frontier of productivity, innovation and competitiveness.
 A new global IBM’s Institute for Business Value (IBV) study on “CEO decision-making in the age of AI, Act with Intention” reveals that 75% of chief executive officers surveyed globally believe the organisation with the most advanced generative AI will have a competitive advantage. 
 A total of 43% also said they are using generative AI to inform strategic decisions, with 36% using the technology for operational decisions.
 “We are in a unique time of AI. At IBM, we call this the opportunity of a lifetime, because everybody has to decide today how they are going to take advantage of the disruptive technology that could accelerate their business, or being left behind,” said Catherine Lian, managing director and technology leader at IBM Malaysia.
 The transformative power of AI, however, also comes with challenges. 
 An IBM 2022 Global AI Adoption Index, which surveyed about 7,500 business leaders around the world, found the major roadblocks that are still holding companies back from the benefit of AI. 
 This includes difficulties integrating data across clouds, a lack of tools to develop models and necessary AI skills and AI expertise, and a lack of strategy in reducing bias in the organisation’s AI.
 Nevertheless, IBM recognises that AI for business has unique needs. 
 Enterprises need access to a full technology stack that enables them to train, tune and deploy AI models, including foundation models and machine learning capabilities, across their organisation with trusted data, speed, and governance – all in one place and to run across any cloud environment in order to have a successful AI adoption.
 In comes IBM Watsonx to address the challenge of scaling and operationalising AI and bridge the gap between AI technology and business outcomes. It is an IBM AI and data platform that provides business users, data scientists and developers with self-service access to high-quality, proprietary IBM foundation models.
 Director of technical sales, software – IBM Technology, APAC, Kitman Cheung said: “With the development of foundation models, AI for business is more powerful than ever. Foundation models make deploying AI significantly more scalable, affordable and efficient.” 
 IBM’s goal in rolling out watsonx – which consists of watsonx.ai, watsonx.data and watsonx.governance – is to help businesses interact and converse with customers and employees, automate business workflows and IT processes, free up your employees from repetitive work and help empower them to deliver faster and better outcomes, be protected against threats.
 “Watsonx offers a solution by delivering one place to utilise state-of-the-art tools to advance their machine learning and generative AI initiatives at scale. 
 “Leveraging these different tools means businesses will be able to train, tune and deploy AI across their operations with trusted data, speed and governance,” Cheung said.
 IBM watsonx.ai is a next-generation enterprise studio designed to empower AI builders. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and capabilities for building and tuning foundation models, generative AI and machine learning.
 On the other hand, IBM watsonx.data –  the fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lakehouse architecture – is a data management solution designed to optimise governed data and AI workloads. 
 This solution can manage workloads both on-premise and across multi-cloud environments. With this solution, an organisation can reduce data warehouse costs by up to 50%.
 Like any technology going through rapid development, AI can be hazardous, especially in business settings. Businesses need AI that provides accurate results they can trust.
 An AI governance toolkit that can protect customer privacy, proactively detect model bias and drift, and help organisations meet their ethics standards, IBM watsonx.governance enables organisations to establish trust, maintain compliance and mitigate potential risks in their AI initiatives.
 “As AI continues to evolve, organisations that embrace these advancements and leverage platforms like Watsonx will have a distinct advantage in unlocking new opportunities, enhancing customer experiences and driving sustainable business growth for the future.

 As digital assets face mounting regulatory pressure and other market headwinds, they have also been dethroned as the latest technology fad.
 When OpenAI launched its ChatGPT bot in November, it paved the way for practical uses of artificial intelligence (AI). Since then, AI has captured the attention of founders and investors – the same folks that fuelled the crypto boom.
 AI may have stolen the limelight, but some crypto enthusiasts say it can provide new opportunities for the blockchain industry.
 “You may actually see a situation where AI is sort of a catalyst to rush back to blockchain,” said Adam Struck, founder and managing partner of investment fund Struck Crypto, which has been diving further into AI since the ChatGPT bot release.
 Blockchain technology can bring greater transparency and decentralisation to AI, which can be extremely opaque in terms of what data is being used to train models, according to Alex Felix, managing partner and chief investment officer at crypto VC firm CoinFund.
 Recently, CoinFund backed Tools for Humanity. The crypto startup cofounded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, which raised US$115mil (RM537.8mil), shows a real use case for crypto in AI, said Felix.
 Tools for Humanity, which developed a digital currency called Worldcoin, created a small orb that scans people’s eyeballs in order to generate a unique ID for that individual based on blockchain, giving them a digital “proof of personhood,” which when combined with Worldcoin can also be used to facilitate secure payments.
 “For us, it started with where’s the world going with AI? And the way to solve that was crypto,” said Tiago Sada, Tools for Humanity’s head of product.
 Felix compares the current AI craze to crypto’s initial coin offering boom in 2017, when investors rushed to snap up random crypto tokens, many of which were scams.
 But he said that this time around, it’s easier to vet new projects and determine whether someone has deep enough expertise in AI.
 “It’s harder to fake credibility because the circles are so small,” Felix said.
 Sussing out hackersJust as blockchain can bring more transparency to AI, the tech can bolster crypto by improving the ways digital-asset platforms sort data, safeguard information and interact with users, according to some crypto supporters.
 Hackers have been able to drain millions of dollars from blockchain protocols.
 AI bots can curtail the swathe of cyberattacks plaguing decentralised finance, according to Struck.
 “You could essentially do very, very large amounts of what’s called pen testing or penetration testing by just having these bots simulate attacks,” he said, adding that this testing could suss out vulnerabilities in smart contract code that hackers can manipulate to siphon cash.
 Bots can also be used to moderate content in order to filter out spam and scams on messaging platforms like Telegram, Discord, Signal, WeChat and WhatsApp, Struck said.
 While this kind of benefit isn’t restricted to crypto, it is important for an industry where many scams originate on social media.
 “So many of the users are concentrated on these messaging apps,” he said.
 In addition to protecting investors from getting swindled, many in the industry see other ways for AI to make it easier for users to interact with crypto.
 Solana Labs, which developed the Solana blockchain, launched a ChatGPT plug-in in May “to make the user experience better, simpler for people to understand what is going on in blockchain”, said Tal Tchwella, head of product at Solana Labs.
 Crypto has been criticised for being too unwieldy for regular consumers, but the ChatGPT plug-in guides users through blockchain transactions in a conversational way.
 In a virtual demonstration, Tchwella showed how a customer can connect their crypto wallet and ask the bot to show them non- fungible tokens they can afford or a specific collection.
 After scrolling through options, customers can ask the bot to help them purchase a NFT.
 The bot then generates a QR code that customers can scan to complete the sale.
 “AI is going to impact every area, every sector, every industry, and we’re just trying to embrace it,” Tchwella said.
 Avoiding the hypeStill, other crypto companies have been hesitant to jump fully on the AI bandwagon, citing its potential dangers. 
 Cypto derivatives exchange Bitget nixed a ChatGPT integration because of concerns over users getting misleading information and false facts in their queries.Tools for Humanity has been lampooned for its eye-scanning tech and questioned about whether the sensitive biometric data it collects is actually protected.
 While The Graph, an indexing protocol, has been leveraging AI and machine learning for more than two years to make blockchain data easier to search and use, it does not want its GRT currency to be classified as an AI token, according to Tegan Kline, CEO of Edge & Node, the startup that created the platform.
 Unlike other crypto companies that have swiftly pivoted to AI to capitalise on the hype, she said Edge & Node prefers to be known first and foremost as a blockchain startup because there are still “hardships” around AI, including how the technology makes it harder to tell what’s true online.
 Meanwhile, “a lot of people are putting AI into their pitch decks to attract more venture capital funds”, Kline said. – Bloomberg",lawsuit security exchange commission coinbase global binance holding question future crypto digital asset regulatory pressure market headwind technology fad openai chatgpt bot november practical artificial intelligence attention founder investor folk crypto boom limelight crypto enthusiast opportunity industry situation sort catalyst rush blockchain adam founder partner investment fund crypto diving chatgpt bot release blockchain technology bring transparency decentralisation opaque term data train model felix partner chief investment officer crypto firm coinfund coinfund humanity crypto startup openai sam altman mil mil real crypto felix tool humanity digital currency orb scan people generate unique individual blockchain digital proof personhood worldcoin facilitate secure payment crypto sada tool humanity product felix current craze initial coin offering boom investor snap random crypto scam time easier vet project deep expertise harder credibility circle hackersjust blockchain bring transparency tech bolster crypto digital asset platform data safeguard interact user supporter hacker million dollar protocol bot swathe cyberattacks finance amount pen penetration bot simulate attack sus vulnerability contract code hacker siphon cash bot content filter spam scam platform discord signal struck benefit crypto industry social medium user apps addition investor industry easier user crypto solana lab solana blockchain chatgpt plug user experience simpler people blockchain tal tchwella head product solana lab crypto unwieldy regular consumer plug guide user transaction conversational virtual demonstration tchwella customer connect crypto wallet bot fungible token specific collection scrolling option customer purchase nft bot code customer scan complete sale impact sector industry embrace tchwella hypestill crypto company jump bandwagon potential danger derivative bitget nixed chatgpt integration concern user false query humanity eye tech sensitive biometric data collect graph protocol machine blockchain data search grt currency token tegan kline ceo edge node startup platform crypto company capitalise hype edge node prefers blockchain startup hardship technology harder true online lot people pitch deck attract venture capital fund bloomberg,"[(2, 0.9968895)]",2
567052,Life Inspired,10,09/07/2023,This AI turns doodles into stunning images,,"Artificial intelligence is shaking up several industries and changing how we use the web. In the field of art creation, AI is showing enormous potential. One example is Scribble (itscribblediffusion.com), which offers users the possibility to create sophisticated imagery from simple sketches.
 This web app allows users to transform basic sketches and drawings into paintings and artworks with various degrees of realism. 
 The idea is to make a rough drawing with a finger, stylus or mouse, then add a brief description in order to obtain a much more “artistic” equivalent in one click. 
 Of course, users can also “touch up” the image afterwards for a result more in line with your expectations.
 Scribble Diffusion is an open-source project, and its code is available on GitHub. Based on a brand new neural network structure called ControlNet, it uses artificial intelligence to “interpret” the drawing and then generate the closest possible “artistic” equivalent.
 How much does it cost?

567256,Main,16,09/07/2023,No plans to regulate AI yet,"However, bosses are urged to draw up policies at work. The Human Resources Ministry is also working towards creating new jobs in the artificial intelligence sector, addressing worries that such technology may replace humans in jobs in the  near future.","FROM writing poems to being news anchors, artificial intelligence (AI) is making its mark in the world, and also in Malaysia.
 In a study by technology firm IBM Malaysia, more companies in the country are exploring and integrating AI into their business operations.
 Nearly a third of companies in the survey have already integrated generative AI – a type of AI system that generates text, images, and other content based on user-given prompts. 
 An example of generative AI is the now popular ChatGPT, which can engage in human-like conversation and create material such as poetry, formal letters, and social media captions to name just a few.
 However, with such advances come concerns, the most popular being the worry that AI can replace humans in certain jobs. Another big concern are ethical and privacy issues.
 So, should AI be regulated?
 The Human Resources Ministry says a decision to introduce guidelines or precautions is a complex one that must be made on a case-by-case basis. 
 “There is no easy answer, and the best approach may vary depending on the specific circumstances.
 “Overall, the government believes that the benefits of using AI outweigh the risks,” the ministry tells Sunday Star.
 For now, the government does not have any specific plans to come up with guidelines on the ethical usage of AI at work.
 “But employers are encouraged to develop their own policies and procedures for the ethical use of AI,” the ministry says, in view of the growing use of AI in the country.
 The technology can boost productivity as AI can analyse huge amounts of data to enhance decision-making. 
 “However, this will also lead to more scrutiny of transparency and privacy as such technologies rely on extensive databases on the Internet to function efficiently. 
 “This will raise concerns about whether data is being accessed ethically,” the ministry points out.
 An example of this is an AI-powered chatbot, or virtual assistant, which deals with customers – it could be misused to collect personal information too.
 “Bosses should consider the specific AI tools that are being used in the workplace and the potential impact of AI on workers. 
 “By developing clear and ethical guidelines for the use of AI, employers can help to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and beneficial way. 
 “This can help to protect employees, customers, and the public from harm,” the ministry says.
 The ministry believes that AI can be used to improve the quality of government services. 
 “For example, AI can be used to analyse data and identify patterns that can help government agencies to better understand the needs of citizens. 
 “This information can then be used to improve the design and delivery of services.
 “The government is committed to using AI in a responsible way that benefits all Malaysians,” it adds.
 Will jobs be replaced by AI?
 The answer to whether our jobs will be replaced by such technology is a yes and no.
 “Of course, not all jobs are at risk of being automated by AI,” the ministry says. 
 “Some jobs, such as those that require creativity, critical thinking, and social interaction, are less likely to be automated.”
 This is due to the fact that AI performs its tasks by using databases built by human beings and is limited by them, lacking the ability to be creative.
 However, the ministry believes that AI is still likely to have a significant impact on the Malaysian workforce in the coming years.
 “According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), 25% of the global workforce will be potentially disrupted due to automation and AI,” it says.
 Examples of potential jobs that AI may replace are those involving manu-facturing, transportation, and customer and retail services, which are all seen as labour-intensive or highly automatable.
 “However, the positive impact of this change is that high-skilled workers will be able to focus on more complex and creative work that requires human skills that are irreplaceable.
 “This will result in increased productivity in the workplace and also encourage value-added business activities among employees.”
 For example, AI can be used to automate tasks such as processing paperwork, answering customer inquiries, and detecting fraud. 
 “This can free up employees to focus on more complex and strategic work,” the ministry explains.
 While it has many strengths, the ministry acknowledges that AI also poses potential risks, such as biased or discriminatory decisions and behaviour. 
 AI bias can happen when it makes skewed or inaccurate predictions because of biased input or incomplete data. 
 A notable example is that of the AI algorithm used in courts in the United States to predict the likelihood of an accused becoming a repeat offender.
 “AI systems can also be hacked or used for malicious purposes. 
 “The government is aware of these risks and is working to develop safeguards to mitigate them,” the ministry says.
 Creating new careers 
 Although the advent of AI may disrupt certain professions, it will also create new ones. In the next five years, the ministry is projecting a spike in demand for high-skilled workers, especially workers who have digital skills in the areas of AI, big data, and digitalisation. 
 “This is because AI operates based on databases and algorithms provided by humans.
 “Workers with such skills will be in demand due to their ability to co-exist with technologies and improve them even further,” the Human Resources Ministry says.
 To address the potential disruptions posed by AI, the ministry has developed a number of policies and initiatives, including upskilling and reskilling programmes to help workers succeed in the age of AI.
 “These programmes include training in AI technology, as well as training in new skills that are complementary to AI, such as data analysis and problem-solving.
 “We are also working to create new jobs in the AI sector. These jobs include software developers, data scientists, and AI engineers.
 “Such initiatives will help to ensure that Malaysia benefits from the opportunities presented by AI, while mitigating the risks,” the ministry states.
 In the WEF’s Future of Jobs 2023 report, AI is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies.
 Most believe the development is positive, with 50% of organisations expecting it to create job growth and 25% expecting it to create job losses.",poem news anchor artificial intelligence mark malaysia study technology firm ibm malaysia company country business operation company survey generative type system text image user prompt generative popular chatgpt engage human conversation material poetry formal letter social medium caption advance concern popular human job concern ethical privacy issue human resource ministry decision introduce guideline precaution complex basis easy answer approach vary specific circumstance government benefit outweigh risk ministry tell sunday star government specific plan guideline ethical usage employer policy ethical ministry view country technology productivity huge amount data enhance decision lead scrutiny transparency privacy technology extensive database internet function concern data ministry chatbot virtual assistant deal customer collect personal boss specific tool workplace potential impact worker ethical guideline employer responsible beneficial protect employee customer public ministry ministry quality government service analyse data identify pattern government agency citizen design delivery service government responsible benefit malaysian job answer job technology job risk ministry job creativity critical thinking social interaction performs database human ability creative ministry impact malaysian workforce economic forum wef global workforce automation potential job manu transportation customer retail service intensive automatable positive impact change worker complex creative human skill irreplaceable result productivity workplace encourage business activity employee automate task paperwork customer inquiry fraud free employee complex strategic ministry strength ministry pose potential risk discriminatory decision bias inaccurate prediction input incomplete data notable algorithm court predict likelihood repeat offender system malicious purpose government aware risk safeguard ministry career advent disrupt profession ministry spike demand worker worker digital skill data digitalisation database human worker skill ability technology human resource ministry potential disruption ministry policy initiative programme worker age programme technology training skill complementary data analysis create job sector job software developer scientist engineer initiative malaysia benefit opportunity risk ministry future job report surveyed company development positive organisation create job growth create job loss,"[(2, 0.4735216), (3, 0.5239693)]",3
567258,Main,17,09/07/2023,‘Time for all to be trained to use AI’,,"THE sooner bosses pay attention to artificial intelligence (AI) and what it can do, the better for all, including workers and the business.
 As such, guidelines should be introduced by bosses in the country on how their workers should use AI in their jobs, says Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman.
 He was responding to a proposal by the Human Resources Ministry for employers to develop their own policies and procedures for the ethical use of AI in view of its growth in Malaysia.
 “This is a good suggestion as the world of work is changing and becoming more automated.
 “Such a trend will continue. So the sooner we pay attention to this, the better. 
 “Now is the time to see how AI can help businesses and the industry, while looking at some guiding principles to help manage this,” he says.
 While AI promises to smooth operations, he admits there are concerns over security, privacy, data trust, and ethics over its use.
 “Businesses using AI models such as ChatGPT need to be aware that generative AI comes with its own set of risks. 
 “There is a need to establish rules and procedures to ensure secure implementation of AI.
 “It will take time and human expertise to unlock AI’s full potential in a way that’s responsible, trustworthy and safe,” he says.
 Recently, it was reported that more companies in Malaysia are exploring and integrating generative AI into their business operations.
 However, not many have come up with official policies for its workers on its usage.
 Some companies which have introduced guidelines have advised workers against providing personal information to AI systems to prevent any privacy issues.
 While bosses are aware of the benefits AI can bring, MEF highlights the need for everyone to be trained to use it effectively. 
 “A lack of skilled talent and technical expertise has been a top barrier to implementing AI since its inception. 
 “To stay competitive in a tight labour market, companies must train their teams to use AI effectively and responsibly. 
 “If people don’t trust the work AI does or the data it’s built on, adoption of AI will lag and returns on investment will not be as fast as they should be,” Syed Hussain says.
 In the next five years, he says bosses expect more people to be working alongside robots and smart machines specifically designed to help them to do their jobs better and more efficiently.
 At the same time, jobs that can be performed through a simple search online or on ChatGPT could be at risk, says JobStreet Malaysia managing director Vic Sithasanan.
 “In its place would be the prioritisation of skills to be able to query, discern, and ‘connect the dots’ or find relevance with technology that cannot replace the human touch,” he explains. 
 Even before Covid-19 posed a threat, job security was already on people’s minds because of automation, he adds.
 “Almost every kind of worker has some level of concern. 
 “JobStreet’s Decoding Global Talent’s third report showed that in 2021, 46% of workers in their 20s and 41% in their 30s were already worried about technology putting them out of work. 
 “From media to information technology, concerns about automation are particularly high – especially among workers with repetitive jobs,” he says.
 According to JobStreet, among some of the industries and jobs that may be replaced by AI – and not just ChatGPT – are translating, managing social media, umpiring sports, and jobs in libraries and call centres.“However, while many people are nervously waiting for the world to become completely reliant on AI in the next few decades, there will always be a need for human force to drive this automation. 
 “Though there may be many jobs that will disappear in the near future due to AI replacement, jobseekers, employees and even employers can enhance and enrich their potential to ensure that their career stays current and in demand. 
 “The world’s workforce may combine man and machine, but a robot-dominated world is not about to become a practical reality yet,” Sithasanan says.
 While the work landscape is evolving due to technology, so are the skills in need, says LinkedIn country manager for Malaysia Rohit Kalsy. 
 “LinkedIn research shows that top skills required for a particular job have changed by an average of 27% since 2015, with the pace of change accelerating during the pandemic. 
 “At this pace, skills could change by 43% to 47% by 2025. 
 “Between 2021 and 2025, we would likely see three new skills in the top skills for a job,” says Rohit, who is also the company’s head of emerging markets (South-East Asia).
 However, there are encouraging signs that professionals in Malaysia are equipping themselves with a combination of hard and soft skills to enhance their employability and remain competitive.
 “Malaysian learners were among the 7.3 million globally who enrolled in the top 20 most popular LinkedIn learning courses between June 1, 2021, and June 30 last year.
 “This is almost double from the previous year. Such figures show that more are building skills to future-proof their careers,” Rohit points out.
 Last month, the Human Resources Ministry said that, with the rise of AI use, as many as 4.5 million Malaysians are likely to lose their jobs by 2030 if they do not improve their skills or attend reskilling and upskilling programmes.",sooner boss attention artificial intelligence worker business guideline boss country worker job malaysian employer president datuk hussain syed husman proposal human resource ministry employer policy procedure ethical view growth malaysia suggestion trend sooner attention time business industry principle promise smooth operation admits concern security privacy data trust ethic business model aware generative risk rule procedure secure implementation time human expertise unlock potential responsible trustworthy safe company generative business operation official policy worker usage company guideline worker personal system prevent privacy issue boss aware benefit mef highlight lack skilled talent technical expertise top barrier inception stay competitive tight labour market company team people data adoption lag return investment syed hussain boss people alongside robot smart machine job time job simple search online chatgpt risk jobstreet malaysia director sithasanan prioritisation skill query discern connect dot relevance technology human touch covid threat job security people automation worker level concern jobstreet global talent report worker technology medium technology concern automation worker job jobstreet industry job chatgpt social medium umpiring sport job library centre people reliant decade human force drive automation job future replacement jobseekers employee employer enrich potential career stay current demand workforce machine robot practical reality sithasanan landscape technology skill linkedin country manager malaysia rohit kalsy linkedin top skill job average pace change pandemic pace skill skill top skill job company head market east asia sign professional combination hard soft skill enhance employability competitive malaysian learner top popular linkedin learning course june double previous figure skill future proof career month human resource rise malaysian job skill upskilling programme,"[(2, 0.99636716)]",2
567296,Main,34,09/07/2023,AI robots reckon they could run the world better,,"Geneva: A panel of AI-enabled humanoid robots told a United Nations summit that they could eventually run the world better than humans.
 But the social robots said they felt humans should proceed with caution when embracing the rapidly-developing potential of artificial intelligence.
 And they admitted that they cannot – yet – get a proper grip on human emotions.
 Some of the most advanced humanoid robots were at the UN’s two-day AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva.
 They joined around 3,000 experts in the field to try to harness the power of AI – and  channel it into being used to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems, such as climate change, hunger and social care.
 They were assembled for what was billed as the world’s first press conference with a packed panel of AI-enabled humanoid social robots.
 “What a silent tension,” one robot said before the press conference began, reading the room.
 Asked about whether they might make better leaders, given humans’ capacity to make errors, Sophia, developed by Hanson Robotics, was clear.
 “Humanoid robots have the potential to lead with a greater level of efficiency and effectiveness than human leaders,” it said.
 “We don’t have the same biases or emotions that can sometimes cloud decision-making, and can process large amounts of data quickly in order to make the best decisions.
 “AI can provide unbiased data while humans can provide the emotional intelligence and creativity to make the best decisions. Together, we can achieve great things.”

565074,StarBiz,12,04/07/2023,Artificial intelligence: Where is business in Vietnam headed?,,"HANOI: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have taken the world by storm, and Vietnam is no exception. Businesses and individuals are getting increasingly comfortable with the new technology.
 “Vietnamese users respond to ChatGPT relatively well,” said associate Professor Nguyen Xuan Hoai, director of the AI Academy Vietnam, at the WISE Talk No. 7 of VnEconomy.
 “This can also serve as a welcome signal for the AI development and application story in Vietnam.”
 Chief executive officer Nguyen Vu Anh of Coc Coc, a popular web browser and search engine in Vietnam, said many local users have been using ChatGPT daily on the browser.
 He estimated that Vietnam currently has half a million daily users of ChatGPT.
 “That is a very large number, especially considering OpenAI is restricting ChatGPT in the Vietnamese market,” Anh said.
 According to Finbold’s data, the global AI market is estimated to reach a valuation of US$208bil (RM971bil) this year, with the potential to hit US$1.87 trillion (RM8.73 trillion) by 2030.
 The global AI market is expected to cross US$1 trillion (RM4.67 trillion) for the first time in 2028.
 Despite this, experts said that Vietnamese businesses face many challenges getting ahead in the AI application race.
 According to Hoai, technology in general is changing fast, but AI is an area of particular concern to business.
 “Today we’re talking about ChatGPT, or AI in general, but in three or five years, we may be talking about something completely different. 
 “Businesses need to calculate how they invest their time and capital very carefully,” added Hoai.
 ChatGPT has already made a strong impression and many ordinary people are now familiar with how it works.
 Vietnamese businesses and individuals are excited about the possibilities, but also anxious about the new technology, said Hoai.
 “They’re content that AI is not an incomprehensible technology – they can apply it to increase productivity and quality of life.”
 The flip side is that AI is already on the radar of the world’s largest companies.
 As AI opens up to big competition, a fierce battle has commenced with the winner taking a major share of the market.
 This has been demonstrated clearly in the case of ChatGPT from OpenAI and Microsoft.
 Immediately after ChatGPT launched, giants such as Google and Facebook quickly stepped in and launched their own products, but none of them have been able to steal the limelight from ChatGPT.
 ChatGPT has already been used to build new products, business models, financial strategies, and more.
 Hoai said that “for Vietnamese businesses, there will be no right-wrong story but only one of choices. 
 “If we choose a global strategy then it will be very difficult to compete with Big Tech abroad. Vietnam is not alone in this situation, many countries are also experiencing this situation.
 “We could choose to stand on the shoulders of giants to compete,” he said.
 “AI models such as ChatGPT are still very new. Most of these models only answer general information, and if we want the answers to be clear in a specific context for an industry or business, or a country, we will have to refine the models, Hoai said.
 The third option is to do it differently to everyone else, he explained. For example, in agriculture there is AI software used to identify rice grains in Japan and the US, but rice in Vietnam is different, so we can’t use the existing tools and must develop our own solution for the local market. — Viet Nam News/ANN",hanoi artificial intelligence tool storm vietnam exception business individual comfortable technology vietnamese user chatgpt associate professor nguyen xuan hoai director academy vietnam wise talk serve signal development application story vietnam chief executive officer nguyen anh coc coc popular web browser search engine vietnam local user vietnam half daily user openai chatgpt vietnamese market anh data global market reach valuation bil potential hit global market cross time expert vietnamese business application race hoai technology concern business chatgpt completely business invest time capital chatgpt strong impression ordinary people familiar vietnamese business individual possibility anxious technology hoai content incomprehensible technology apply increase productivity quality life flip radar largest company competition fierce battle winner major share market chatgpt openai microsoft chatgpt giant facebook product steal limelight chatgpt chatgpt build product business model financial strategy vietnamese business wrong story choice global strategy difficult compete tech vietnam situation country situation choose shoulder giant model model answer specific context industry business country refine model option agriculture software rice grain rice vietnam tool solution local market viet nam news ann,"[(3, 0.9947485)]",3
564706,Lifestyle,3,03/07/2023,The allure of AI,,"FOLLOWING the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that kicked off late last year with the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, large tech companies have been in what feels like an AI arms race to take the lead.
 Industry giants like Google, Meta, Microsoft and others have been pushing further into the field of generative AI, but as the tools they create get more powerful, how much will they actually transform society?
 At the Asia School of Business’ (ASB) Leadership Summit, which had the theme “AI@Work”, experts weighed in on what the future might bring.Do the maths
 Prof Ong Shien Jin, who teaches data analytics at ASB, gave an overview of the history of AI, saying that while the buzz surrounding it has exploded in the past few months, its history goes as far back as the 1950s.
 “Pioneering computer scientists were asking a question: can computers be made to think?” he said.
 One such scientist was Alan Turing, an English mathematician and computer scientist who developed the Turing test to determine whether or not a machine is capable of intelligent behaviour.
 Prof Ong’s presentation included a live demonstration of ChatGPT solving an A-level maths problem.
 The demonstration used the more powerful GPT-4 with the plug-in for Wolfram Alpha, a computational tool for answering questions and solving maths problems.
 “To me, this was truly impressive, because maths computation is one thing, but maths reasoning is a higher-order thinking skill.
 “So is it ‘game over’ for education as we know it? Maybe it’s time to rethink the maths curriculum. We think that AI is going to change education, not destroy it.
 “We believe that there is a good possibility that AI and humanity can coexist in synergy, but this utopian vision is not a given because we have to work towards it,” he said.
 Samuel Flanders, a professor of economics at ASB, explained how ChatGPT could interpret and categorise huge blocks of text data.
 Prof Flanders said that in cases where there’s an abundance of text data, such as reviews or social media posts, ChatGPT can be used to extract specific information or themes from large datasets.
 “In the past, your options to deal with this sort of dataset were either very superficial or very difficult to execute.
 “For example, you could do a search to figure out how frequently a keyword appears and associate it with a certain type of response.
 “Or more recently, you could do a sentiment analysis to figure out if a response is generally positive or negative.
 “But these are superficial; if we want to go deeper and understand what’s really going on in the data, it’s very hard to do that.
 “Now, you can ask holistic qualitative questions about a big dataset of text, and you can get an answer in just a few minutes,” he said.Bring your A-game
 Another demo of ChatGPT’s utility was from ASB Master’s student Swaroop Ganireddy, who managed to build an interactive website with ChatGPT in just 10 minutes by simply providing it information via prompts.
 Had he taken it upon himself to build it, it would have taken Swaroop over a month.
 Additionally, Swaroop demonstrated a Windows-compatible tic-tac-toe game that ChatGPT entirely created.
 Meanwhile, Prof Isaac Chuang, the senior associate dean of digital learning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), discussed a possible solution to chatbot hallucinations.
 Prof Chuang credits the solution to a paper by his colleagues Antonio Torralba and Joshua Tenenbaum, who had two large language models (LLM) propose differing answers and then debate in order to reach a consensus.
 “The paper has these two agents talk to each other by presenting each answer to the other and asking them to resolve their differences.
 “In the second round, the agents apologised for the confusion and the conflicting responses and came to an agreement,” he said.
 Another speaker from MIT was Prof Daniela Rus, a roboticist and director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was optimistic about the future as the vital ingredients are already in place.
 “This promise and progress are enabled by three interconnected fields.
 “We have robotics, which puts computing into motion and gives machines the ability to move.
 “We have AI, which gives machines intelligence and enables them to see, hear, and even communicate like humans.
 “And we have machine learning, which aims to learn from and make predictions on data,” she said.
 Prof Rus shared examples of the potential of AI technology to eliminate car accidents, make transportation more affordable, better monitor, diagnose, and treat disease, keep information private and safe, enable easier communication, and make education more widespread.
 This would allow human workers to focus on tasks requiring critical thinking and strategy, with machines taking on other, more routine tasks.

564578,Main,31,02/07/2023,Vietnam tells foreign social media to use AI to detect ‘toxic’ content,,"HANOI has told cross-border social platforms to use artificial intelligence (AI) models that can detect and remove “toxic” content automatically, the latest requirement in its stringent regime for social media firms, state media reported.
 Vietnam has repeatedly asked companies like Meta’s Facebook, Google’s YouTube and TikTok to coordinate with authorities to stamp out content deemed “toxic”, such as offensive, false and anti-state content.
 “This is the first time Vietnam has announced such an order,” state-run broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) reported from the information ministry’s mid-year review event, which was opened to selected newspapers.
 The report did not give details on when and how cross-border platforms had to abide by the new requirement.
 During the first half of this year, in accordance with government requests, Facebook removed 2,549 posts, the ministry said in a statement. 
 YouTube removed 6,101 videos while TikTok took down 415 links, the info ministry said in a statement.
 The announcement came as South-East Asian countries are drawing up governance and ethics guidelines for AI that will impose “guardrails” on the booming technology.
 Vietnam in recent years has issued several regulations together with a cybersecurity law that target foreign social media platforms in a bid to battle disinformation in news and force foreign tech firms to establish representative offices in Vietnam and store data in the country.
 The country last month undertook a comprehensive inspection on short videos platform TikTok’s local operations and preliminary results showed “various” TikTok violations, the info ministry has said.

564476,Main,33,02/07/2023,Execs urge Europe to rethink its world-leading AI rules,,"LONDON: More than 150 company executives are urging the European Union to rethink the world’s most comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence, saying that upcoming regulations will make it harder for companies in Europe to compete with rivals overseas, especially when it comes to the technology behind systems like ChatGPT.
 Officials at companies from French planemaker Airbus and carmaker Renault to Dutch beer giant Heineken signed an open letter to EU leaders saying the 27-nation bloc’s groundbreaking legislation may put shackles on the development of generative AI. 
 That technology gives popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT the power to generate text, images, video and audio that resemble human work.
 “Such regulation could lead to highly innovative companies moving their activities abroad  and investors withdrawing their money from AI development in Europe,” the letter said on Friday. 
 “The result would be a critical productivity gap between the two sides of the Atlantic.”
 The executives say laws requiring “rigid compliance” would be ineffective when so little is still known about the risks and uses of generative AI. They urged the EU to revise the AI Act to focus broadly on the risks.
 With growing concerns about the impact of AI on all parts of life, the letter does acknowledge “a clear need to properly train these models and ensure their safe use”.
 The executives called for a regulatory body of experts that can regularly adapt rules to new developments and respond to risks that emerge. 
 They also pointed to the need for transatlantic standards.
 It’s the latest letter to weigh in on the future of AI, which has dazzled users but raised concerns about data privacy, copyright infringement and disinformation.

564606,Lifestyle,20,02/07/2023,Will AI really destroy humanity?,"Here are some possible, if far-fetched, scenarios in which artificial intelligence wipes out humanity.","THE warnings are coming from all angles: artificial intelligence (AI) poses an existential risk to humanity and must be shackled before it is too late.
 But what are these disaster scenarios, and how are machines supposed to wipe out humanity?
 Paperclips of doom
 Most disaster scenarios start in the same place: machines will outstrip human capacities, escape human control and refuse to be switched off.
 “Once we have machines that have a self-preservation goal, we are in trouble,” AI academic Yoshua Bengio said at an event.
 But because these machines do not yet exist, imagining how they could doom humanity is often left to philosophy and science fiction.
 Philosopher Nick Bostrom has written about an “intelligence explosion”, which he says will happen when superintelligent machines begin designing machines of their own.
 He illustrated the idea with the story of a superintelligent AI at a paperclip factory.
 The AI is given the ultimate goal of maximising paperclip output and so “proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paperclips”.
 Bostrom’s ideas have been dismissed by many as science fiction, not least because he has separately argued that humanity is a computer simulation and supported theories close to eugenics.
 He also recently apologised after a racist message he sent in the 1990s was unearthed.
 Yet his thoughts on AI have been hugely influential, inspiring both Elon Musk and Prof Stephen Hawking.
 The Terminator
 If superintelligent machines are to destroy humanity, they surely need a physical form.
 Arnold Schwarzenegger’s red-eyed cyborg, sent from the future to end human resistance by an AI in the movie The Terminator, has proved a seductive image, particularly for the media.
 But experts have trashed the idea.
 “This science fiction concept is unlikely to become a reality in the coming decades, if ever at all,” the Stop Killer Robots campaign group wrote in a 2021 report.
 However, the group has warned that giving machines the power to make decisions on life and death is an existential risk.
 Robot expert Kerstin Dautenhahn, from Waterloo University in Canada, played down those fears.
 She said AI was unlikely to give machines higher reasoning capabilities or imbue them with a desire to kill all humans.
 “Robots are not evil,” she said, although she conceded that programmers could make them do evil things.
 Deadlier chemicals
 A less overtly sci-fi scenario sees “bad actors” using AI to create toxins or new viruses and unleashing them on the world.
 Large language models like GPT-3, which was used to create ChatGPT, turn out to be extremely good at inventing horrific new chemical agents.
 A group of scientists who were using AI to help discover new drugs ran an experiment where they tweaked their AI to search for harmful molecules instead.
 They managed to generate 40,000 potentially poisonous agents in less than six hours, as reported in the Nature Machine Intelligence journal.
 AI expert Joanna Bryson from the Hertie School in Berlin said she could imagine someone working out a way to spread a poison like anthrax more quickly.
 “But it’s not an existential threat,” she said. “It’s just a horrible, awful weapon.”
 Species overtaken
 The rules of Hollywood dictate that epochal disasters must be sudden, immense, and dramatic, but what if humanity’s end was slow, quiet, and not definitive?
 “At the bleakest end, our species might come to an end with no successor,” philosopher Huw Price says in a promotional video for Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.
 But he said there were “less bleak possibilities” where humans augmented by advanced technology could survive.
 “The purely biological species eventually comes to an end, in that there are no humans around who don’t have access to this enabling technology,” he said.
 The imagined apocalypse is often framed in evolutionary terms.
 Prof Hawking argued in 2014 that ultimately our species will no longer be able to compete with AI machines, telling the BBC that it could “spell the end of the human race”.
 Geoffrey Hinton, who spent his career building machines that resemble the human brain, latterly for Google, talks in similar terms of “superintelligences” simply overtaking humans.
 He told US broadcaster PBS recently that it was possible that “humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence”. – AFP",warning angle artificial intelligence existential risk humanity late disaster scenario machine wipe humanity paperclip disaster scenario machine human capacity human control refuse machine preservation goal trouble academic yoshua bengio event machine doom humanity philosophy science fiction philosopher nick bostrom intelligence explosion superintelligent machine machine idea story superintelligent paperclip factory ultimate goal paperclip output proceeds earth observable universe paperclip idea science fiction humanity computer simulation theory eugenics racist message influential elon musk prof stephen terminator superintelligent machine humanity physical form arnold schwarzenegger red cyborg future human resistance movie terminator seductive image medium expert idea science fiction concept reality decade robot campaign report machine power decision life death existential risk robot expert kerstin dautenhahn waterloo university canada fear machine capability desire kill human programmer deadlier chemical scenario bad actor create toxin unleashing language model create chatgpt horrific chemical agent scientist drug experiment search harmful molecule poisonous agent hour nature machine intelligence journal expert joanna bryson hertie school berlin imagine spread poison anthrax existential threat horrible awful weapon specie rule epochal disaster sudden immense dramatic humanity quiet definitive bleakest specie huw price promotional video cambridge university centre study existential risk bleak possibility human advanced technology biological specie access technology apocalypse evolutionary term ultimately specie machine bbc spell human race geoffrey hinton career machine resemble human brain google talk term superintelligences human broadcaster pb humanity phase evolution intelligence afp,"[(1, 0.09516455), (6, 0.90156984)]",6
564294,StarBiz 7,17,01/07/2023,Why India risks falling behind in the AI race,,"INDIA’S tech industry is being less than bold in embracing artificial intelligence (AI). It’s hoping to create solutions for corporate clients by building on top of somebody else’s investment in foundational technologies, hardly a strategy for pathbreaking success.
 ChatGPT’s high-voltage debut last year has galvanised China. Baidu Inc’s Ernie, which claims to have outperformed Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI’s model on some measures, has pulled Ant Group Co and JD.com into the bot-building race.
 Tech czars like Wang Xiaochuan, the founder of the search engine Sogou, have also joined the quest, drawing talent to the industry. On money flow, the United States is still beating China six to one, but the number of venture deals in the Asian country’s AI industry is already outpacing consumer tech, according to Preqin data.
 India’s startup landscape, meanwhile, is caught in a time warp, with embarrassed investors marking down their stakes in Byju’s, an online education company collapsing under the weight of its own reckless growth.
 The easy funding from the pandemic era has dried up. As financiers push founders for profitability, they’re discovering that in many cases even the revenue is fake.
 This was the perfect time for the traditional Indian coding powerhouses – the likes of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and its rival Infosys Ltd – to put their superior financial muscle to use and assert leadership in generative AI.
 But they have their own governance challenges. TCS is distracted by a bribes-for-jobs scandal in the United States that it is desperately trying to downplay. Infosys is busy managing the blowback from its association with an Australian lobbying firm in the centre of a parliamentary inquiry Down Under.
 Even without those challenges, the outsourcing specialists aren’t exactly in a sweet spot. Demand for their services is weak, particularly because of the turmoil in global banking.
 Decisions on IT spending have slowed. Keener competition for a smaller pie could mean a fall in order wins and deterioration in pricing, JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts said earlier this month.
 Meanwhile, the Indian firms’ wage bills are bloated, thanks to their hiring spree during the pandemic when clients were scrambling to digitise their operations.
 No wonder then that the industry’s approach to AI is defensive, geared toward assuring investors that the technology poses little threat to its time-tested model of labour-cost arbitrage.
 When three lines of C programming replaced 30 lines of assembly language, it didn’t lead to mass layoffs but an explosion in code-writing. Similarly, when outsourcing made enterprise software cheaper, IT budgets didn’t deflate. Volumes rose, as prices fell. Why should this time be different, asks the TCS annual report for 2022-2023.
 This is a rather phlegmatic reaction to a revolution whose possibilities are beginning to scare its own creators. ChatGPT can surely write snippets of code or run a quality check on them, potentially reducing billing hours. 
 But that’s hardly the point that needs addressing. Being around machines that are smarter than any of us has troubling prospects for the future of humanity, especially if the algorithms come to be controlled by evil actors.
 Even leaving aside those profound concerns about a potentially dystopian future, the more prosaic questions are also of significance for users of enterprise software. 
 Companies from banking to retail and aviation must decide their engagement with so-called large language models.
 And they can’t be sure if taking something off the shelf is good for data privacy. What exactly are Indian firms doing to grab this opportunity?
 Bengaluru-based Infosys has adopted a mix-and-match strategy, so its clients can choose from 150 pre-trained models across more than 10 platforms, and then run them on any cloud or in-house servers.
 The TCS annual report says that its research in large language models is oriented toward “creating techniques for controlled code generation, question answering, consistent image generation, solving optimisation problems and other core AI problems.”
 However, if Alphabet Inc is cautioning employees about how much information they can share with chatbots, including its own Bard, then how can TCS or Infosys assume that global multinationals will be comfortable pitching their tents on platforms available to just about anyone?  Indian software services firms also ought to be building language models from scratch for themselves and their customers. Yes, it takes computational power and engineering talent to train neural network-based programmes on vast amounts of natural-language inputs.
 But to not go down that route and look to connect clients via application programming interfaces, or APIs, to existing products is unnecessarily timid, especially when no serious business might want to rely on a publicly available external foundational model for mission-critical tasks.
 Google’s own research on training data extraction, or the potential for models to leak details from the data on which they’re trained, shows that the risk is very real.
 Creating well-guarded, proprietary foundational technologies isn’t particularly resource-intensive.
 To Nvidia Corp cofounder Jensen Huang, whose chips are at the centre of the AI excitement, even a modest US$10mil (RM46.7mil) budget for large-scale models is not unrealistically low.
 Countries that aren’t traditionally known as tech producers are also getting noticed for their breakthroughs. Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute has made its Falcon 40B – trained on 40 billion parameters – royalty-free for commercial use. 
 The Chinese have clearly not bought into the idea that Silicon Valley will control the keys to generative AI.
 While Indian software firms’ excessive service orientation has meant very few successes in developing products, now is the time for some ambition, and a new strategy that goes beyond charging customers a fee for tweaking OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Bard or Meta Platforms Inc’s LLaMA with specialist data. 
 On a recent visit to the country, OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman was asked if someone in India with US$10mil (RM46.7mil) to invest should dare to build something original in AI.
 He said: “The way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation models (so) you shouldn’t try, and it’s your job to like, try anyway.” — Bloomberg

563292,StarBiz,14,29/06/2023,Possible cuts in AI chip exports to China,US considering stopping shipments as early as July,"NEW YORK: The United States is considering new restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
 Shares of Nvidia fell more than 2%, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell about 1.5% on the news in extended trading.
 Reports have said that China’s massive demand for advanced semiconductors to power new AI development projects has created a fast-growing market for smuggled graphics processing units or GPUs, such as the A100 and H100 devices from Nvidia Corp, according to industry insiders.
 It is an under-the-counter trade that has apparently prospered.
 The Commerce Department will stop the shipments of chips made by Nvidia and other chip companies to customers in China as early as July, the report said.
 Nvidia, Micron and AMD are among the US chipmakers caught in the crossfire between China and the Biden administration.
 In September, Nvidia had said that US officials asked the company to stop exporting two top computing chips for AI work to China.
 Months later, Jensen Huang-led Nvidia said it will offer a new advanced chip called the A800 in China to meet export control rules.
 The company also tweaked its flagship H100 chip early this year to comply with regulations.
 But the new curbs being mulled by the department would ban the sale of even A800 chips without a special US export licence, the report added.

 Before the emergence of AI software, freelance copywriter Rasyida Salleh needed almost a whole day to finish a couple of 1,000-word articles.
 However, the rise of ChatGPT since late last year had shortened it to only a few hours, allowing the 28-year-old to produce even more content daily. Instead of worrying about the competition she might face due to AI, she said the technology could help her add more value to her work and increase her productivity. Rasyida also said she would maintain credibility by fact- checking the content generated by the software.
 “At the end of the day, AI needs us to humanise the end product, especially when it comes to creative content production. Techno­logies are here to help us, not take over us. Learning how to use it will ensure our jobs remain relevant. It’s all about embracing and adapting,” she said.Freelance scriptwriter Naquib Aqmal said the use of ChatGPT had made it easier for him to express his ideas while conforming to certain formats.
 “After writing my initial script, AI tools help me to automatically rearrange my script to match the specific format or criteria that the client requests,” he said, adding that the likelihood of AI replacing him was unlikely so long as he kept building on his scriptwriting skills.“The reason why the biggest movies and shows are not written by AI yet is because creativity and talent cannot be easily imitated by a bot,” the 22-year-old said.
 Video editor Dominique Palen­cia, 28, said many of the Adobe software that he used to edit his videos come with AI tools that have helped him in his work.
 “One of the AI tools is called rotoscoping that separates subjects from their background, similar to a green screen, only without the actual screen,” he said, adding that he usually uses Adobe Premiere and After Effects for his work.“The tool has been around for a while but Adobe’s AI has made it much more accurate and efficient,” he added.
 In general, he believed that AI would help complement his video editing work and make his job easier rather than replace it.
 “At least for now, I don’t see AI replacing video editors entirely. There are still other aspects of video editing that require a human touch, like when it comes to pacing, editorial decisions of what to include and cut out,” he said.
 Tech company manager Raven­der Sathivelu, 28, said AI has had little effect on his role managing people involved in the logistics of his company’s products.
 “AI technology has little impact on my job as it requires a lot of social interaction and strategic planning,” he said, adding that managerial roles require human- related skills that will not be replicated by AI anytime soon.
 “However, I have seen individuals using AI software to increase their productivity at work and achieve goals faster,” he added.
 Ravender believes that adopting AI technology will be slow in the country as it is still expensive and employers have more trust for manual labour performed by humans.
 “As a small and medium-scale enterprise, my company does not want to bear the heavy costs of purchasing AI services as a company-wide policy,” he said. “I think there will be a few early adopters, but they will likely use it to enhance productivity.”
 Supply chain executive Darren Teh Zhi Wei, 26, said that while AI had automated the management of materials, individuals like him were still essential to prevent any malpractice.
 “AI systems help to automate a lot of the steps during procurement like invoicing, material management and tracking of items, which saves a lot of time for all sides of the transaction.
 “However, personnel like me must go on-site to check and validate the orders as well as oversee the entire process from start to finish to ensure no mismanagement or foul play occurs,” he said.",jaya artificial intelligence substitute human talent tool complement employee software freelance copywriter rasyida salleh day finish couple word article chatgpt hour content competition technology add increase productivity maintain credibility content software day humanise product creative content production techno logies job relevant freelance scriptwriter naquib aqmal chatgpt easier express idea format initial script tool script match specific format criterion client request likelihood building skill reason biggest movie creativity talent bot video editor dominique cia adobe software edit video tool tool separate subject green screen actual screen adobe premiere effect adobe accurate efficient complement video job easier video editor video require human touch editorial decision tech company manager raven der sathivelu role people logistics company product technology impact job social interaction strategic managerial role human skill anytime individual software increase productivity goal technology slow country expensive employer manual labour human medium scale enterprise company heavy cost service company wide policy adopter productivity supply chain executive darren teh zhi wei management material individual essential prevent malpractice system lot step procurement material management item lot time transaction personnel site check validate oversee entire process start finish mismanagement foul play,"[(2, 0.9949587)]",2
563506,Main,5,29/06/2023,"Tame the AI beast, youths urged","Experts urge Malaysian workers to learn, adapt and stay flexible","PETALING JAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technical marvel – a beast that youths can tame.
 Experts are calling on Malay­sians to equip themselves with the appropriate skills if they want to remain relevant in the tough job market.
 Usha Devi Arumugam, a human resource expert at PeopleBiz Consulting, says employees should develop their skills in digital literacy as well as non-technical skills.
 She said this includes adopting a learning mindset, being adaptive to changes and being socially intelligent.
 “In the longer run, I believe that employers would want employees who have a good understanding of business regardless of their job role.
 “As organisations face more challenges in the industry, employees who have a good sense of what drives the business will be more valued.
 “Being a specialist in a particular job role is good, but to find the connection of what we do for the business as a whole is valuable,” she said.
 Digital literacy refers to a person’s ability to use information technology and digital technology to find, evaluate, create and communicate information.
 Aside from this, Usha also encouraged employees to be creative in resolving issues related to their work and not wait for employers to provide upskill programmes for them to learn new skills.
 “Knowing different ways to solve issues will be beneficial for the employer. This not only means creating new products, but also finding new ways to make processes faster and easier, finding new ways of doing things and challenging the status quo,” she said.
 “It is advisable for employees to not wait for companies to train them to learn new skills as they should be proactive and take the initiative to find the skills that they want to acquire,” she added.
 Usha said employees do have an incentive to learn new skills as it can open up a new space for salary negotiation with employers.“If these new skills allow the employees to execute the job fas­ter, with more accuracy, have a positive impact on the team, department or business and add value to the organisation, there will definitely be room for salary negotiation,” she said.
 Managing director of JobStreet Malaysia, Vic Sithasanan, was optimistic about the influence of AI technology, claiming that as some jobs become automated, new ones will emerge.
 “Employers should provide opportunities for learning and development, particularly in the digital and AI-related areas,” Vic said.
 “They should also redesign jobs to leverage the strengths of both humans and AI,” he added.
 As for employees, Vic said they need to be proactive in learning new skills and adapting to changes in the job market.
 “Employees need to understand that AI should be seen as a tool that enhances human capabilities, not as a replacement,” he said.
 “The focus should be on using AI to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human employees to perform more complex, creative, meaningful and ‘value-added’ work,” he added.
 Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said employers are encouraged to work with higher learning institutions,  specialised training providers and industry experts to train employees.
 “The training will be intended to close the skills gap of the workforce by developing more life-long learning courses to upskill and reskill existing workers and new potential employees,” he said.
 Soh added that FMM had proposed in its 2023 Budget memorandum for the Human Resource Development Corporation (HRD Corporation) to help finance training programmes organised by employers.
 “For every RM1 spent on training by employers, HRD Corpo­ration tops up the employers levy account with RM3 especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” he said.
 “A cap could be set on the amount that can be claimed by employers under this top-up scheme annually.”
 Tax advisory firm TraTax’s co-founder Thenesh Kannaa said that learning to use AI and new digital tools in accounting would enable accountants to perform better.
 “Software AI tools that enable accounting entries to be automatically posted by simply scanning vendor invoices are already employed by many accounting firms today.
 “These tools relieve accountants from needing to perform repetitive tasks like data collection, processing and formatting which allows better resource management for both the accountant and the firm as a whole.
 “By using these tools, we will be able to focus on improving our problem-solving and value-creation skills,” Thenesh, who is also a member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said.
 Yayasan Digital Malaysia’s head of digital innovation Mohd Fazli Azran shared the same sentiment, adding that having strong fundamentals and flexibility would be key in the future job market.
 “Strong knowledge of concepts, principles and best practices will be essential as it will enable us to effectively utilise these new AI tools, particularly when it comes to cybersecurity.
 “Cultivating a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability allows us to constantly anticipate new attack vectors and devise innovative defence strategies before they even occur,” he added.
 On Monday, Human Resources Minister V. Sivakumar said that as many as 4.5 million Malaysians are likely to lose their jobs by 2030, if they do not improve their skills or attend reskilling and upskilling programmes with the rise of AI.
 He cited the 2020 World Eco­nomic Forum (WEF) warning that AI could cause a recession in the job market as it is already being used to automate tasks in various industries.

562972,StarBiz,8,28/06/2023,"Mizuho rolls out generative AI to its 45,000 bank workers in Japan",,"TOKYO: Mizuho Financial Group Inc is giving all its Japan bank employees access to Microsoft Corp’s Azure OpenAI service this week, making it one of the country’s first financial firms to adopt the potentially transformative generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
 The banking giant will allow 45,000 workers at its core lending units in the country to test out the service, according to Toshitake Ushiwatari, general manager of Japan’s third largest bank’s digital planning department. 
 Already, managers and rank-and-file employees are submitting dozens of pitches for ways to harness the technology even before the software is installed.
 There are many employees who are embracing ChatGPT in their private lives, Ushiwatari said in an interview.  
 “It’s like poking a beehive,” he said, referring to the enthusiastic response the firm’s move has sparked. 
 “They think it will completely re-set the world, triggering disruptive innovation,” he said.
 The developments at Mizuho and its peers come as Wall Street grapples with the unfolding AI revolution and its impact. 
 Within global banks, some have clamped down on ChatGPT for employees, even as they use AI for business purposes such as scanning wealthy client portfolios and screening for potential defaulters. Japanese financial firms, by contrast, appear to be adopting a more permissive stance internally. Ushiwatari’s team plans to hold a so-called “ideathon” within the firm in Japan as early as next month and is brainstorming various ways to encourage employees to experiment with the technology. 
 The tool will be introduced to its brokerage unit in the country next month, he said.
 So far, one of the ideas being floated is to use generative AI – in which AI models analyse volumes of data and use it to generate new images, texts, audio and video –as a one-stop reference point for the bank’s vast trove of internal rules, processes and other manuals. 
 Ushiwatari has a rare background for a career-long banker. 
 He went to one of Japan’s most prestigious science schools, Tokyo Institute of Technology, because he wanted to become a rocket scientist. 
 But he switched career ambitions, joining what is today’s Mizuho and has stayed for nearly three decades. 
 He said he is well aware of the risks of generative AI and the bank is introducing guidelines when it rolls out the technology to employees, such as information management, intellectual property and ethics. 
 Still, generative AI is something that will lift society and the bank cannot shy away from, according to Ushiwatari. 
 “This is something we have to do, otherwise, we get left behind,” he said. —Bloomberg",tokyo mizuho financial japan bank employee access corp azure openai service week country financial firm transformative generative artificial intelligence technology banking giant worker unit country test service ushiwatari manager japan largest bank digital planning department manager file employee dozen pitch technology software employee chatgpt private life ushiwatari interview beehive enthusiastic response firm move disruptive innovation development peer street grapple revolution impact global bank chatgpt employee business purpose wealthy client portfolio potential defaulter japanese financial firm permissive stance ushiwatari team plan ideathon firm month encourage employee technology tool brokerage unit country month idea generative model volume data generate image audio video reference bank vast internal rule manual ushiwatari rare background career banker japan prestigious science school institute technology rocket scientist career ambition mizuho decade aware risk generative bank guideline roll technology employee management intellectual property ethic generative lift society bank shy ushiwatari bloomberg,"[(2, 0.36161816), (5, 0.63332736)]",5
563036,Main,20,28/06/2023,Monitoring wound recovery using AI,,"A paper-thin sensor patch the size of a postage stamp attached to the skin could soon help to determine how well a wound is healing – without the need to remove its dressing.
 The artificial intelligence-­enabled device aims to provide a more efficient way of monitoring wound recovery, as well as improve wound care and management.
 Dubbed the Paper-like Battery-free In situ AI-enabled Multiplexed (Petal) sensor patch, it measures just 1.8cm by 1.8cm.
 It was developed by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s Institute of Mate­rials Research and Engineering (Imre).
 A paper on the researchers’ work on the sensor patch, which was developed in collaboration with a research team from the Nanyang Technological University and the Skin Research Institute of Singapore, was published in the scientific journal Science Advances in June.
 “A lot of times if you don’t have a way to monitor the wound-­healing process, especially for more complex wounds, then this becomes a problem,” said Assoc Prof Benjamin Tee from the NUS Institute for Health Innovation and Technology during a media briefing on Monday.
 Prof Tee, the principal investigator for the research, said wound dressing such as bandages could lead to infections if done improperly.
 The issue of wound management is especially relevant in an ageing society like Singapore, where most wounds are experienced by those aged 80 and above, he added.
 Wound healing currently typically requires a physical examination by a clinician, with wound infections that need a period of up to three days to be diagnosed.
 Each sensor patch features a panel in the shape of a flower, with each of its five petals acting as a sensor for one of five markers – the temperature of a wound, its acidity, moisture levels as well as the presence of uric acid and trimethylamine, a chemical compound.
 These cover a wide spectrum of situations, allowing for more comprehensive assessments of the wound-healing status, said principal scientist Su Xiaodi, who is from the soft materials department at Imre.
 The patch collects fluid from the wound and distributes it to the five sensors, which change colours to show the levels of these indicators. Images of the sensor patch can be captured using a smartphone and classified using AI. — The Straits Times/ANN",paper thin sensor patch size postage stamp skin determine artificial intelligence device aim efficient monitoring wound recovery wound care management paper battery free situ multiplexed petal sensor patch measure researcher national university nu agency science technology institute mate rial engineering imre paper researcher patch collaboration team technological university institute singapore scientific journal science advance june lot time process complex wound prof benjamin tee institute health innovation technology medium monday prof tee principal investigator bandage infection wound management relevant society singapore wound physical examination clinician wound infection period day sensor patch feature panel shape flower petal sensor marker acidity moisture level presence uric acid trimethylamine chemical compound cover wide spectrum situation comprehensive assessment status principal scientist xiaodi soft material department imre patch fluid wound sensor colour level indicator image patch smartphone strait time,"[(5, 0.9932254)]",5
562248,StarBiz,5,26/06/2023,Daythree aiming to harness the power of AI,GBS provider to focus on customer experience,"THE concept of business process outsourcing or BPO may be well known in Malaysia but a new moniker is making its way into the mainstream. 
 According to veteran technology professional Raymond Devadass, the moniker “global business services” or GBS is the new term that has replaced BPO.
 “While BPO primarily focused on cost reduction, GBS emphasises an integrated approach to outsourcing that includes accessing new technologies and adding value to organisations,” he told StarBiz. 
 But how is that achieved? 
 Devadass, the founder and managing director of soon-to-be listed Daythree Digital Bhd, said this is where companies like his have sought to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence, to unlock new opportunities, optimise processes, and deliver enhanced value to its customers.
 As a tech-driven GBS provider, Daythree focuses on customer experience (CX) and lifecycle management services, in which it relies on a synergistic blend of cutting-edge technology and human expertise to drive innovation and achieve growth.
 Devadass further explained that Daythree operates as a comprehensive customer experience centre rather than a conventional call centre, thanks to its in-house designed digital tools.
 In this role, they manage all customer interactions, taking a broader approach to ensure a seamless and exceptional experience throughout the entire service journey.
 “Typically, a conventional call centre’s job is to attend calls and pass the information back to the service provider. But today, the job has changed. 
 “Hence, the job of a customer experience centre, like what we do, is not just to manage the transaction, but also the entire service journey,” he said, adding that Daythree is an end-to-end customer service experience provider.
 Enroute to an ACE Market listing, Daythree has outlined its strategy to expedite its expansion plans by utilising the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO), where it is seeking to raise RM33.12mil.
 Out of the entire IPO proceeds, RM14,70mil or 44.4% has been earmarked for working capital requirements, including the recruitment of an additional 380 CX executives. 
 This investment aims to bolster Daythree’s capacity to service a growing number of contracts, as the group currently has around 1,800 CX executives.
 Within the short to medium term, the group also plans to double its headcount from the 1,800 people currently.
 “People cost is a significant component in our business and as such, we will channel a big chunk of the proceeds for working capital for our upcoming contracts. This is because the number and size of contracts that we can undertake at any point in time depend largely on the availability of our working capital,” Devadass said.
 Achieving more with less people
 He explained that while customer experience is Daythree’s core focus, technology is a significant differentiator for them. 
 “Our constant thinking is how we can achieve more with less people. Therefore, technology becomes a very crucial component in our service provision to further reduce dependency on people,” he highlighted.
 Raymond said that while they ensure all their employees are paid above the minimum wage, raising the minimum wage also impacts higher wages.
 A further RM7.1mil or 21.4% of the proceeds will be used to part-finance the additional working space required for its growing customer base and the expansion of its headquarters to cater for the rising number of employees as well as to set up a multipurpose facility for internal training and meetings.
 Devadass explained that the group has intentions to increase its current headquarters built-up area from about 4,000 sq ft, occupied by its management level employees, to 6,045 sq ft, in order to accommodate the current and additional management team.
 The company also plans to set up two new CX delivery offices with an aggregate built-up area of about 12,000 sq ft and a multipurpose facility with a built-up area of approximately 6,000 sq ft to be used for internal training, meeting, rest and recreational purposes.
 Another RM3mil or 9.1% of the proceeds will be allocated for capital expenditure, covering networking infrastructure, hardware, and software. 
 Additionally, RM3.02mil or 9.1% of the proceeds will be utilised for recruiting industry experts, enabling Daythree to capture growth opportunities within the local GBS industry. 
 According to Devadass, talent acquisition is a major challenge faced not only by Daythree but also the entire industry.
 He said the proceeds will not only be utilised for talent recruitment but also for upskilling the existing workforce.
 “I think the big component of retaining talent is being able to upskill them,” he further explained.
 Additionally, RM1.5mil or 4.5% has been designated for branding, marketing, and promotional activities and the remaining RM3.8mil or 11.5% will be utilised to cover estimated listing expenses.
 Meanwhile, citing an independent market researcher Protege Associates Sdn Bhd, Devadass said the local GBS industry is expected to reach RM24.9bil in 2023 and projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 6.3%, to hit RM31.9bil by 2027. 
 In-house digital tools
 Devadass believed the group is well positioned to leverage this growth, supported by three of its in-house designed digital tools.
 According to him, all three of the group’s in-house developed digital tools, namely Daisy, Faith and Saige, go hand in hand.
 He explained that Faith is a platform designed to improve employee engagement by providing tools for streamlining scheduling, automating payroll processes, facilitating communication, and enhancing performance feedback within Daythree and its workforce.
 Daisy, on the other hand, is a customer relationship management which is embedded with robotics process automation which makes it a game changer.
 Proving it, Raymond describes a typical scenario in a contact centre where agents spend additional time after a call to create a case, contact engineers, and handle various tasks across multiple systems. 
 To streamline this process, Daythree has developed Daisy that sits on top of existing systems. 
 “After a call, agents only gather basic information, and bots take over the remaining tasks by sending information to relevant departments,” he said.
 Currently, Daythree operates a bot farm consisting of 60 bots that automate a significant portion of the tasks formerly performed by agents, resulting in time savings and increased productivity.
 With this automation, agents can handle a significantly higher number of interactions in a given time period, Raymonds pointed out.
 “Overall, the bots assist in deflecting routine and mundane tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and critical work,” Raymond said.
 Finally, Saige, which serves as the group’s business intelligence tool, gathers real-time data from every customer interaction and captures it within a unified analytics platform. 
 This allows for analysis, interpretation, and recommendations for improvement based on the collected data.
 “We are always hungry to look for the latest technologies available to help us with the work we do for our clients,” Devadass said.
 Hence, even today, Daythree is dabbling with generative pre-trained transformers or generative AI to further improve efficiency.
 Raymond said the challenge for service providers today is to achieve an omni-channel approach, which involves having a consolidated view of the customer across multiple channels, including in-store visits, social media interactions, and messaging platforms.
 He emphasised the importance of technology in achieving this and providing a seamless customer experience. 
 By consolidating customer views, Daythree aims to anticipate needs and provide personalised assistance.
 Meanwhile, Raymond pointed out that Daythree has started working with regional brands outside of Malaysia, expanding their customer base beyond local Malaysian companies. 
 He added that Daythree has secured projects with companies in the travel, hospitality, banking, and security management sectors. 
 This signifies a shift towards engaging with more global and regional brands, reducing their dependence on local clients over time.",concept business process bpo malaysia moniker mainstream veteran technology professional raymond devadass moniker global business service gb term bpo bpo cost reduction gb emphasis approach technology organisation starbiz devadass founder director daythree digital bhd company harness power artificial intelligence human intelligence unlock opportunity enhanced customer driven gb daythree focus customer experience lifecycle management service synergistic blend edge technology human expertise drive innovation growth devadass daythree operates comprehensive customer experience centre conventional call centre house digital tool role manage customer interaction broader approach seamless exceptional experience entire service journey conventional call centre job pas service provider job job customer experience centre manage transaction entire service journey daythree customer service experience provider enroute ace market daythree strategy expedite expansion plan utilising proceeds initial public offering ipo raise mil entire ipo proceeds mil capital requirement recruitment additional executive investment bolster daythree capacity service contract executive short medium term plan double headcount people people component business channel chunk proceeds capital contract size contract undertake time depend availability capital devadass people customer experience daythree core focus technology differentiator constant thinking people technology crucial component service provision dependency people raymond employee minimum wage minimum wage impact wage mil proceeds additional space customer base expansion headquarters cater employee multipurpose facility internal training meeting devadass intention current headquarters management level employee accommodate current additional management team company delivery office multipurpose facility internal training meeting rest recreational purpose mil proceeds capital expenditure networking infrastructure hardware software mil proceeds utilised recruiting industry expert daythree capture growth opportunity local gb industry devadass talent acquisition major challenge daythree entire industry proceeds utilised talent recruitment workforce component talent upskill mil promotional activity mil listing expense independent market researcher protege associate bhd devadass local gb industry reach bil compound annual growth rate bil house digital tool devadass positioned leverage growth house digital tool house digital tool faith saige hand hand faith platform employee engagement providing tool payroll communication performance feedback daythree workforce daisy hand customer relationship management robotics process automation game changer raymond describes typical scenario contact centre agent additional time call create contact engineer task multiple system streamline process daythree daisy sits top system call agent basic bot task relevant department bot farm bot automate portion task agent time saving productivity automation agent handle interaction time period bot assist routine mundane task human resource complex critical raymond saige serf business intelligence tool gather real time data customer interaction capture analytics platform analysis interpretation recommendation improvement data hungry technology client daythree generative pre transformer generative efficiency raymond challenge service provider omni channel involves consolidated view customer multiple channel store visit social medium interaction platform technology seamless customer experience customer view aim provide assistance raymond daythree regional brand customer base local malaysian company secured project company hospitality banking security management sector shift global regional brand dependence local client time,"[(1, 0.40689704), (3, 0.59144187)]",3
560398,StarBiz,7,23/06/2023,More companies in the country using AI in  their operations,,"KUALA LUMPUR: More companies in Malaysia are exploring and integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into their business operations, says IBM Malaysia.
 According to a study by IBM’s Institute for Business Value, over 40% of ICT professionals reported that their organisations are actively exploring the use of generative AI to drive business growth.
 Surprisingly, nearly a third of the surveyed companies have already integrated generative AI.
 This is setting new benchmarks in innovation and success, said IBM Malaysia managing director and technology leader Catherine Lian. 
 She said in a statement yesterday that the government should be commended for positioning Malaysia as a regional leader in the field of AI.
 “The government’s focus on AI as a key driver for economic recovery, innovation, and bridging the digital divide is commendable,” Lian said.
 “The Malaysia Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 and the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint exemplify the government’s vision for integrating AI across sectors.
 “It is fostering productivity enhancement, attracting international investments, and narrowing the gap with advanced nations,” she added.
 Lian said IBM believes that AI holds great promise for Malaysia’s economic growth with the National Industrial Revolution 4.0 policy’s target of a 30% output increase by 2030 underscoring AI’s crucial role.
 On IBM’s part, she said it remains committed to supporting Malaysia’s AI initiatives and contributing to the development of a vibrant and successful AI ecosystem in the country while building a prosperous and inclusive digital future for Malaysia.
 The heart of successful AI adoption is data, the company said. 
 “But it isn’t enough to simply collect and store large volumes of data, businesses need to seamlessly and securely access, govern and use this data to drive digital transformation.”
 While some organisations have tried to manage this complexity by migrating their data to a central repository, Lian said “the reality is that the copy-and-paste model of data management is an inefficient and costly process.”
 To address these challenges, IBM has introduced a new approach called a “data fabric” strategy.
 The strategy is a unified approach to data management that seamlessly integrates diverse data sources and formats.
 It breaks down data silos, enabling organisations to access and analyse data from various locations in real time. — Bernama",kuala lumpur company generative artificial intelligence business operation malaysia study ibm institute business ict professional organisation generative drive business growth company generative benchmark innovation success ibm malaysia director technology leader catherine lian statement yesterday government malaysia regional leader field government focus key driver economic recovery innovation digital divide commendable lian malaysia artificial intelligence roadmap malaysian digital economy blueprint exemplify government vision sector productivity enhancement international investment gap nation lian ibm promise malaysia economic growth national industrial revolution policy target output increase crucial role ibm committed malaysia initiative development vibrant successful ecosystem country prosperous inclusive digital future malaysia heart successful adoption data company collect store volume business access govern data drive digital transformation organisation complexity data central repository lian reality copy paste model data management inefficient costly process address approach data fabric strategy strategy approach data management diverse data source break data silo organisation access data location real time bernama,"[(5, 0.99397945)]",5
559276,StarBiz,13,20/06/2023,Could AI  be the  comeback break for workers?,,"SINGAPORE: Could the era of generative artificial intelligence (AI) mark the glorious return of older, experienced workers who had lost their edge in the digital age?
 With generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Adobe Firefly making tasks such as coding and video editing as easy as typing in an “ask”, experts foresee a rise in the competitiveness of workers who have served corporate time.
 Vis-a-vis their younger, digital-savvy counterparts, the playing field is levelling “to some extent”, said Associate Professor Damien Joseph, the associate dean at Nanyang Business School.
 With the right requests, or prompts, dominating outcomes of what computers serve up, experience matters, Prof Joseph said.
 And experience comes with the package of domain expertise to guide AI tools better, contextual knowledge to identify biases, errors and gaps, and judgement to consider the broader implications of decisions.
 Age alone does not confer the upper hand, cautioned Associate Professor Terence Ho from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.
 He said: “The mature workers who stand to benefit most are those who have already acquired experience in their area of work.
 “They can leverage their experience and insights to parse the input of AI, as well as tap AI to do their job better or more efficiently, rather than mature workers who are coming in cold to a new job or vocation.”
 Since the launch of ChatGPT last November, AI tools have been rapidly adopted by industries ranging from banking and healthcare to real estate and home repair.

559356,StarBiz,16,20/06/2023,Top stock  picker scouts  AI fringes  to beat off peers,,"SYDNEY: When it comes to trading the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy, one top-performing global equity fund is winning big by scouting out some out-of-the-box ideas.
 Fairlight Asset Management’s Nick Cregan invests in companies he believes will be enhanced by AI or well protected from its implications.
 It’s a conviction that’s helped propel his Fairlight Global Small and Mid Cap fund up 24% over the past year, beating 97% of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 “We’re not trying to pick the winner in AI, we think that’s a mug’s game,” Cregan said in an interview. 
 “You’re going to have some leading companies, which you think are going to be the winners, and then all of a sudden there’s going to be some interesting technology that emerges that completely displaces that business.”
 The fervour around AI has grown since ChatGPT’s release last year and has snowballed as companies race to churn out rival tools and products to power them. 
 Many investors see the technology as on the cusp of revolutionising the way some companies and sectors operate.
 The Nasdaq Composite Index has climbed 31% in 2023, and tech stocks have helped pull the broader S&P 500 Index up 15%.
 German online marketplace Scout24 SE, up 26% year to date, is among the Sydney-based fund’s top holdings.

558896,Lifestyle,6,19/06/2023,AI in sports: promise or peril?,"When it comes to artificial intelligence, does the sporting  world stand to gain or lose?","WILL sports coaches, managers and scouts soon be redundant? Will the dream team line-up, best substitutions and hottest transfers be just a key-push away with the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI)?
 The sports industry is reluctant to reveal the full extent of its success in implementing this technology. 
 But AI experts say people shouldn’t fear the advent of a soulless, computer- shaped sporting reality.
 “I’m sure it won’t come to that – and as a football fan, I hope not too,” says Tim Schroder, a product developer for online platform Plaier looking to revolutionise player scouting with AI.
 “People need other people as reference partners,” Schroder said. 
 “Technology is just an aid.” And used as such, AI could improve the quality of sports, he believes.
 But the developer is a realist too: “The future cannot be stopped and that future will also be increasingly determined by AI in sports.”
 Naturally, the early adopters of such technology will have a head start, says Schroder, without seeing an immediate threat of this eroding the essence of sporting competition.
 The Institute for Applied Training Science (IAT) in the eastern German city of Leipzig, where AI is now mainly used in biomechanics, takes a similar view.
 “AI is not a risk in our field, but an opportunity to generate more data in less time,” says Bjorn Maurer, a scientific expert in sports informatics.
 At IAT, the movements of a skier or discus thrower are filmed and evaluated with software and the athlete is tagged with AI-supported recording systems. Internationally, Germany is “well placed” in this respect, says Maurer, “but China is probably further ahead”.
 Given the overall secrecy of high-tech development, the question of what AI can already do in sports is not easy to answer.
 “Artificial intelligence can help structure data, show conspicuous features and reduce the amount of data in such a way that people can deal with it better,” says sports scientist Carlo Dindorf from Germany’s Technical University of Kaiserslautern-Landau.
 In lesser forms, though, AI has long been part of everyday sports life, as many people already use “fitness trackers” that provide information on stress and fatigue reactions, for example.
 At the German cycling team Bora-Hansgrohe, six people are working on the daily processing of vast amounts of data on wattage, pulse and much more. In Formula 1, data analysis has been influencing race strategy for many years, and the use of AI via software companies is also intensifying here.
 In professional football, Plaier wants to take player scouting to a new level by means of specially developed AI using real-time analysis of the playing system and squad. 
 The results are linked to data on over 100,000 players who are recorded in the system and weighted according to their abilities in relation to the club looking for them.
 In this systematic approach, the AI learns from historical data and forecasts. Plaier’s co-founder Jan Wendt offers customers the prospect of a 90% hit probability for transfers: “We don’t say, ‘That could happen’, but we say, ‘This is happening and will look like this in the next six years’.”
 The German Ski Association (DSV) is still in the early stages of using AI, but initial tests, for example in the selection of waxes, have been “very promising”, according to Karlheinz Waibel, DSV national coach for science and technology.
 At the 2022 Olympics in Beijing, it was possible to find out more quickly with AI programs than with conventional ski tests which texture of ski was best suited to the cross-country track, Waibel told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
 “The added value is great. But you have to want to afford it,” Waibel said of the accompanying need for major investment in the technology.
 Meanwhile, coaches will remain essential to sports, he expects: “The coach is still very important. After all, data does not explain everything. Knowledge, experience, and, last but not least, soft skills are just as important as AI to advance the athlete.”
 Maurer from the IAT also warns of “increased risk” if decisions are handed over to AI in its current state. If, for example, the technical evaluation in sports such as apparatus gymnastics were completely left to the computer, “it could definitely be manipulated via the software – and not in a sporting way, but technologically”.
 In sports, the data sets are still relatively small, but that will change with the increasing use of AI. 
 It is data-hungry – and the more it is fed, the greater the output.
 Austria’s national football coach, Ralf Rangnick, who prides himself on thinking outside the box, predicts “unimagined possibilities” when it comes to AI in sport: “The more AI develops, the more data volume, the more information there is, the more you can get out of it,” he says. – dpa",sport coach manager redundant dream team substitution transfer key push proliferation artificial intelligence sport industry reluctant reveal extent success technology expert people advent soulless computer reality football fan tim schroder product developer online platform plaier revolutionise player people people partner technology aid quality sport developer realist future future sport adopter technology start schroder threat essence competition institute science iat eastern german city leipzig biomechanics view risk field opportunity data time bjorn maurer scientific expert sport informatics iat movement skier discus thrower evaluated software athlete system germany respect maurer china secrecy tech development question sport easy artificial intelligence structure data conspicuous feature amount data people sport scientist carlo germany technical university kaiserslautern landau lesser form everyday sport life people fitness tracker stress fatigue reaction german team bora hansgrohe people daily vast amount data wattage pulse formula data analysis race strategy software company professional football plaier player level real time analysis system squad data player system weighted ability relation club systematic approach historical data forecast founder jan wendt customer probability transfer german ski association dsv stage initial test selection wax karlheinz waibel national coach science technology olympics program conventional ski test cross country track waibel rheinische post newspaper afford waibel major investment technology coach essential sport coach data knowledge experience soft skill advance athlete maurer iat warns risk decision current technical evaluation sport gymnastics computer software sport data set data hungry output austria national football coach ralf rangnick pride box predicts unimagined possibility sport data volume dpa,"[(0, 0.17822272), (2, 0.81866807)]",2
559160,Main,20,19/06/2023,Asean to set ‘guardrails’ on AI,Regulators drafting rules to govern use of generative artificial intelligence,"South-East Asian countries are drawing up governance and ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) that will impose “guardrails” on the booming technology, five officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.
 Regulators across the world are rushing to draft regulations to govern the use of generative AI, which can create text and images and is engendering excitement as well as fear about its potential to reshape a wide range of industries.
 Ministers from the 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) agreed in February on the need to develop an Asean “AI guide” for the region of 668 million people,  but details of the discussions among regional policymakers have not previously been reported.
 Senior South-East Asian officials said the so-called Asean Guide on AI Governance and Ethics was taking shape and would try to balance the economic benefits of the technology with its many risks.
 “The drafting is ongoing and it could be completed towards the end of the year before it is endorsed by Asean members,” one official said.
 Another official said it could be announced at the Asean Digital Ministers’ Meeting early next year.
 A spokesman for Singapore’s Ministry for Communications and Information said that as 2024 chair of that meeting, the country would be collaborating with other Asean states “to develop an ‘Asean Guide on AI Governance and Ethics’ that will serve as a practical and implementable step to support the trusted deployment of responsible and innovative AI technologies in Asean”.
 Besides Singapore, the other Asean countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Some of these governments were not immediately reachable for comment.
 The sources declined to comment further on what the AI guide would look like, given the early stage of the discussions and confidentiality of the Asean process.
 The sources, who included officials in three South-East Asian countries, declined to  be identified as they were  not authorised to speak to the media.
 Moves by Asean to set guidelines around AI come as the European Union and United States are expected to release a draft of a voluntary AI code of conduct within weeks. 
 The code would take effect ahead of the EU’s trailblazing AI Act, which is still being thrashed out.

558582,StarEdu,8,18/06/2023,"Embrace XR,  AI in  learning",Stakeholders must come together to integrate immersive tech into education,"ALTHOUGH education is a powerful tool for shaping the future, conventional education methods are no longer adequate to meet the changing needs of students and society.
 Extended reality (XR), the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) hold the key to unlocking new frontiers of education, ensuring learners are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a dynamic world.
 Imagine wearing augmented reality glasses to assess building information systems at a construction site, putting on a virtual reality headset to study history in a simulated world of the Melaka Sultanate, learning about bones and muscles without cutting up cadavers, or exploring protein molecules without using a microscope – these are not mere concepts anymore. 
 Instead, they are actual XR adoptions that educational institutions are already implementing in their syllabi to transform various aspects of our lives.
 These experiences push the thought processes and the possibilities of what learners can achieve in this day and age. 
 As we are at the precipice of a new era, younger generations of today will think of newer ways to create content, market their products, and even share their experiences with the help of immersive technologies and AI. 
 They can apply what they have learned, and align it with their interests and needs to see how technology can help their issues and challenges.
 As educators, it is crucial to ask ourselves: Are our students equipped to thrive in a rapidly evolving future that is shaped by emerging technologies such as XR, the metaverse and AI? 
 And equally important, is Malaysia positioned to be a nation that embraces innovation and pioneers new frontiers of knowledge in this digital age?Though the answer is yes, adopting these new emerging technologies comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. 
 Collaborative efforts among educational institutions, technology providers and policymakers are seen to be vital. Such collaboration can lead to the development of funding initiatives, streamlined processes and support structures that facilitate the seamless integration of XR into education. 
 By embracing XR, we empower students to be at the forefront of shaping industry through their adaptability, creativity and eagerness to embrace innovation.
 Over time, XR and the metaverse will redefine how we live, work and socialise. Existing jobs such as digital marketing and film production are evolving to include XR in their workforce development. 
 Newer job positions such as immersive designers and AI engineers are also coming up, boosting business and employment opportunities for digital talents.
 Nevertheless, it is crucial to address the valid concerns and scepticism surrounding emerging technologies. 
 While fear of job displacement and livelihood disruption persists, it is important to recognise that these technologies are not intended to replace but rather to empower us.
 The onus now is on our society to shift its mindset and begin embracing XR, the metaverse and AI in education. 
 Educational institutions can act as the intermediary between industry and the schools as they can provide learners with a platform for experimentation in research and development.
 This would then establish Malaysia as a nation that pioneers new frontiers of knowledge, embracing innovation in this digital age. 
 We no longer would be losing industry expertise to our neighbouring countries, as with the talent and expertise that we have, we would be the central hub of digital innovation for graduates to look inward instead of outward, fostering a better future for us all.

558678,Main,36,18/06/2023,"New Grammy Awards rules require human input, curb AI use",,"LOS ANGELES: “Only human creators are eligible” for the Grammy Awards, the Recording Academy declared, as the body that grants the world’s most recognised music awards seeks to curb the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the industry.
 AI-only work is banned, but some music created with AI help may qualify in certain categories, the academy’s updated rulebook reads. “A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any categories.”
 Music creators must now contribute to at least 20% of an album to earn a nomination. In the past, any producer, songwriter, engineer or featured artist on an album could earn a nomination for album of the year, even if the person had a small input.
 The first Grammy Awards ceremony took place in 1959, to reward music creators from 1958.
 In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a free chatbot backed by Microsoft Corp that can generate human-like dialogue based on simple inputs. 
 AI apps have mushroomed, allowing users to animate still photos, create avatars in films and write songs, essays and articles.
 People in many professions are growing fearful that AI could displace humans. For example, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) are wrestling with the use of AI in the creative fields of screenwriting and acting.

558522,StarBiz 7,10,17/06/2023,Let the British government write AI rules,,"IT’S hard not to cringe at UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s pronouncement that Britain should “lead the way” on artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. After all, AI will impact the globe in different ways, and Brexit hasn’t exactly inspired confidence in British policymaking.
 Yet Brexit is partly why the UK could fill this watchdog role successfully. AI is moving fast, threatening to create more bias and inequality in society, and governments need ideas for guidelines yesterday. 
 Britain not only has the expertise and infrastructure to draw up rules around AI, it can move quickly, thanks in part by having thrown off the shackles of European Union (EU) frameworks and obligations. 
 By contrast, it’ll be another two years before the EU’s AI Act comes into force, even though its Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour of it Wednesday. 
 And while US senators are keen to set up an independent AI regulator, aggressive Silicon Valley lobbying makes that unlikely. Congress, after all, has never passed a federal law to regulate Big Tech.
 Britain offers a temperate middle ground between the onerous approache of Europe and the more laissez-faire US, where most AI innovation is coming from. The UK has moved fast on tech governance before – its data protection rules for children were among the first in the world and copied by California; its Online Safety law will roll out before a similar set of rules from the EU; and its antitrust watchdog pursued a flurry of high-profile cases against Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple Inc and Meta Platforms Inc after Brexit. 
 The Brits have meanwhile been upgrading their government machinery, allowing them to tackle AI more effectively. 
 For instance, the UK recently fused its top regulators into a single body for coordinating decisions, which will be vital for a technology that impacts almost every industry. 
 In addition to a formidable commercial law sector and a centuries-long reputation for the rule of law, the UK also hosts one of the world’s biggest AI companies, Google DeepMind, and a culture where technologists liaise with the government as advisers. It doesn’t hurt that everyone speaks English too. 
 “There’s only one positive to Brexit and it’s that the UK is now in a position to be a global leader in AI governance,” says Saul Klein, co-founder of London venture capital firm LocalGlobe. 
 In February 2023, the UK combined its government departments covering business and digital sectors into one, called the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. 
 In the eyes of the government, that elevated tech to a similar level of importance as the economy and national security, says Klein, who is a non-executive director of the new department. 
 The UK also brought together its top regulators that handle issues like antitrust, data privacy and online harms under one umbrella, called the Digital Regulatory Cooperation Forum. That will make it much easier to set and enforce rules on AI with one voice. 
 Why spend years building a new regulator when existing watchdogs have set themselves up to address the technology’s disruptions together, says Rachel Coldicutt, who specialises in tech regulation and is an executive director of Promising Trouble, a social enterprise that builds and supports alternatives to Big Tech.
 How might Britain try to regulate AI? Its upcoming rules on online harm borrow principles from health and safety law, giving companies a legal “duty of care” to maintain a safe environment.Britain will probably go down a similar route with AI, according to regulatory experts, adopting a risk-based approach to regulation.Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind and a government adviser, has similar views: He recently advocated for the “precautionary principle” when regulating AI. 
 Taking precautions
 That essentially means taking precautions when you are uncertain of the risks – like telling a child not to play soccer inside the house to avoid breaking anything. The alternative would be to let them play, and then only when they break a lamp, create new rules about soccer in the house. There is one glaring problem with the UK’s efforts to oversee AI, though, and it speaks to the country’s chummy and insular tendencies. 
 Sunak recently announced a global AI safety summit taking place this fall to kick off the country’s regulatory ambitions, and neglected to include people who work in civil society.
 The summit will bring together nations, researchers and “leading tech companies” such as Google DeepMind and Microsoft Corp, according to the 1,400 word press release announcing the event. Yet nowhere alongside the big names did it mention people researching flaws in present-day AI systems. 
 A UK government spokesman said that the summit was aimed at creating “international guardrails for the safe and responsible development of AI.”
 Serious and widespread
 Current AI problems are serious and widespread. They affect women, people of color and other minority groups more often than not, from algorithms that check asylum-seeker applications to those that filter job ads. British organisations like the Ada Lovelace Institute, Demos, Connected by Data and Promising Trouble, which investigate such flaws, should be invited to discuss AI safety with big corporate names too. — Bloomberg

557692,StarBiz,9,15/06/2023,AMD’s AI chip challenge to Nvidia remains uphill task,,"SAN FRANCISCO: Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) on Tuesday gave new details about an artificial intelligence (AI) chip that will challenge market leader Nvidia Corp, but the company left out what Wall Street wanted to know – who plans to buy it.
 Santa Clara, California-based AMD said the forthcoming chip, which will start trickling out in the third quarter followed by mass production beginning in the fourth quarter, will have 192 gigabytes of memory.
 That could help tech companies get a handle on the spiralling cost of delivering services similar to ChatGPT, AMD chief executive Lisa Su told Reuters in an interview. 
 She spoke following a keynote presentation in San Francisco during which Su showed an AI system on the MI300X chip writing a poem about the city.
 “The more memory that you have, the larger the set of models” the chip can handle, Su said. “We’ve seen in customer workloads that it runs much faster. We really do think it’s differentiating.”
 But unlike past presentations where AMD has talked up a major customer for a new chip, AMD did not say who will adopt the MI300X or a smaller version called the MI300A. The company gave no details on how much the chip will cost or how it will bolster its sales.
 AMD’s shares have doubled in price since the start of the year and touched a 16-month high earlier on Tuesday, but closed down 3.6% after the presentation on the AI strategy. 
 Nvidia shares finished 3.9% higher at US$410.22 (RM1,895.42), making it the first chipmaker to close with a market capitalisation above US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion).
 “I think the lack of a (large customer) saying they will use the MI300 A or X may have disappointed the Street. They want AMD to say they have replaced Nvidia in some design,” said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research.
 Nvidia, whose shares have surged 170% so far this year, dominates the AI computing market with a market share of 80% to 95%, according to analysts.
 Nvidia has few competitors working at a large scale. 
 While Intel Corp and several startups such as Cerebras Systems and SambaNova Systems have competing products, Nvidia’s biggest sales threat so far is the internal chip efforts at Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com’s cloud unit, both of which rent their custom chips to outside developers. — Reuters",san francisco micro device tuesday detail artificial intelligence chip challenge market leader nvidia corp company wall street plan santa clara california chip start quarter mass production fourth quarter gigabyte tech company cost delivering service amd chief executive lisa reuters interview keynote presentation san francisco system chip poem city memory larger set model chip handle customer workload presentation major customer chip amd adopt version company detail chip cost bolster sale share price start month tuesday presentation strategy nvidia share chipmaker close market capitalisation lack customer disappointed street amd nvidia design kevin krewell principal analyst tirias nvidia share dominates market market share analyst competitor scale intel corp startup cerebras system sambanova system product nvidia biggest sale threat internal chip effort amazon cloud unit rent custom chip developer reuters,"[(0, 0.48574197), (4, 0.50832695)]",4
556848,StarBiz,8,14/06/2023,AI hype starting to  ‘smell like dot-com era’,Current mood reminiscent of tech bubble days,"LONDON: The exuberance surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has driven a lot of capital into a small corner of the market in a very short space of time, and that has implications for tech-heavy environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds.
 According to James Penny, the chief investment officer of TAM Asset Management and a veteran ESG investor, the current mood is reminiscent of the early days of the tech bubble that burst in 2000 and wiped more than 70% off the Nasdaq. 
 “Companies that even mention the word AI in their earnings are seeing boosts to their share price, and that smells very much like the dot-com era,” Penny, who invests in funds rather than directly in stocks, said in an interview. 
 “I think the market has got a little bit over its skis. I’d put much larger odds on it coming down from here.”
 The race to get a piece of the AI boom went into turbo mode last month, after Nvidia Corp wowed the market with a set of sales targets that surprised even the most upbeat analyst forecasts. 
 The company has added almost 30% to its market value since the announcement in late May, bringing gains this year to more than 160% and helping the Nasdaq add a third to its value.
 It’s a development that’s helped boost funds with ESG mandates, as ESG portfolios rely increasingly on tech to lower their carbon footprint without sacrificing growth. 
 An analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence shows that tech makes up a third of preferred stocks in so-called Article 9 funds, the highest ESG classification in the European Union. 
 That’s by far the biggest chunk of all sectors.
 About 1,300 ESG-registered funds hold more than US$20bil (RM92.4bil) in Nvidia alone, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 At the same time, there’s a subset of ESG fund managers that market themselves as AI-themed, with Bloomberg identifying 20 as of early June that together hold about US$8bil (RM37bil) in assets under management. 
 While Nvidia supplies the chips for AI processing, the technology itself is being developed by a number of tech giants including Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc. 
 The market for generative AI products, which refers to tools like ChatGPT that can create content such as text or images from a prompt, has the potential to grow more than 40% a year and reach US$1.3 trillion (RM6 trillion) in the coming decade, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mandeep Singh. 
 Penny, who’s got roughly a decade of experience selecting assets based on their ability to outperform in a world increasingly shaped by environmental and social risks, said eagerness to be exposed to AI is in part feeding off premature bets that the Federal Reserve will start reversing its cycle of interest-rate increases. 
 With the United States grappling with a regional banking crisis, “the market very quickly accelerated into this scenario where rate cuts are going to be coming quite soon because this is obviously evidence of the economy cracking,” Penny said. 
 That “spurred more and more inflow into growth investing.” 
 Against that backdrop, “you had this AI trend, which just literally came out of nowhere,” and now “the market’s gone off to the races, like massively in,” he said.
 But the buying spree has been fed by “just a few sectors,” in fact, just a handful of stocks, Penny said. At the same time, there’s still the very real risk of a recession, he said. 
 So instead of piling into the same AI names that others are buying up, Penny says he’s following the playbook of the gold rush of the 1800s, when the smart money didn’t waste time looking for gold, but invested in the tools needed to dig it up.
 “I think you’re going to see a massive wave of AI-led products in the market and we will be looking at that, but you have to be very selective,” Penny said. 
 “I would be focusing less on AI manufacturers and more on AI adopters, so that ‘pick-and-shovel”’ kind of strategy. 
 “That’s “always where you find phenomenal companies that are in support of the theme and the movement,” he said.
 Memory chips, which are crucial to the kinds of deep-learning applications needed to support generative AI, are one such area, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence that singled out Samsung Electronics Co, SK Hynix Inc and Micron Technology Inc.  
 Bloomberg Intelligence also pointed to semiconductor testing devices from US-based Teradyne Inc and Advantest Corp of Japan as stocks that are likely to benefit from the furore surrounding AI.
 And given the current environment, the goal isn’t to be overly exposed to sectors that rely heavily on low interest rates and a strong economy, Penny said.
 “What generates a recession rips apart the status quo,” he said. “So one has to be wary of that high growth narrative.” — Bloomberg",london exuberance artificial intelligence lot capital corner market short space time implication heavy environmental social governance esg fund penny chief investment officer asset management veteran investor current mood reminiscent day bubble burst nasdaq company word earnings boost share price smell era penny fund stock interview market bit ski larger odds race piece boom turbo mode month corp market set sale target upbeat analyst forecast company market announcement bringing gain development fund esg mandate portfolio tech lower carbon footprint growth analysis bloomberg intelligence tech preferred stock article fund esg classification european union biggest chunk sector fund bil bil data bloomberg time fund manager market bloomberg june bil asset management nvidia supply chip technology tech giant microsoft corp amazon google parent alphabet market generative product refers tool create content text image potential grow reach decade bloomberg intelligence senior analyst mandeep singh penny decade experience asset ability outperform environmental social risk eagerness feeding premature federal reserve cycle rate increase regional banking crisis market scenario rate cut evidence economy penny inflow growth backdrop trend market race spree sector handful stock penny time real risk recession name penny playbook gold rush smart money waste time gold tool dig massive wave product market selective penny manufacturer adopter shovel strategy phenomenal company theme movement memory chip crucial kind deep learning application generative analysis bloomberg intelligence samsung electronics hynix micron technology bloomberg intelligence semiconductor device advantest corp japan stock furore current environment goal sector low rate strong economy penny recession rip status wary growth narrative bloomberg,"[(0, 0.8604828), (3, 0.13641137)]",0
556862,StarBiz,12,14/06/2023,Oracle climbs to record high as AI-frenzy spurs Cloud demand,,"NEW YORK: Oracle Corp gave investors a boost by saying the company’s cloud-computing business will continue to grow rapidly in the coming financial year after a strong performance in the past quarter. 
 Shares, which had jumped to a record high at the close, rose another 3% in extended trading.
 Cloud sales gained 54% in the financial fourth quarter to US$4.4bil (RM20.3bil) after a 45% jump in the previous period. 
 In the financial year ending May 2024, cloud revenue should increase at least as much as in the year that just ended, chief executive officer Safra Catz said on a conference call after the results. 
 John DiFucci, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said the continued strength in the unit is abnormal given the current economic environment.
 Oracle has focused on expanding its cloud infrastructure business to more forcefully compete with market leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, which have seen recent slowdowns. 
 A boom in generative artificial intelligence (AI), which needs tremendous computing power, is boosting demand for Oracle’s cloud services, executives said. 
 Generative AI startup Cohere said last week that Oracle was among its investors in a US$270mil (RM1.2bil) funding round.
 “We see shares maintaining their recent positive momentum as the narrative of growing cloud momentum, partly fuelled by AI demand, remains intact,” said Raimo Lenschow, a Barclays analyst.
 Cloud infrastructure revenue increased 76% to US$1.4bil (RM6.5bil) in the period ended May 31, Oracle said on Monday. 
 Cloud application sales jumped 45% to US$3bil (RM13.8bil), the Austin, Texas-based company said. 
 Over US$2bil (RM9.2bil) in cloud capacity has recently been contracted by companies doing large language model development such as Mosaic ML, Adept AI and Cohere, Oracle chairman Larry Ellison said in the statement. 
 “Oracle’s Gen2 Cloud has quickly become the No. 1 choice for running generative AI workloads,” he said.
 Total sales increased 17% to US$13.8bil (RM64bil) in the quarter. Analysts, on average, estimated US$13.7bil (RM63.2bil), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 Profit, excluding some items, was US$1.67 (RM7.72) a share, compared with the average estimate of US$1.58 (RM7.30).
 “Both of our two strategic cloud businesses are getting bigger, and growing faster,” Catz said in the statement. “That bodes well for another strong year in the financial year 2024.”
 Shares hit a high of US$122.87 (RM568) in extended trading after closing at a record US$116.43 (RM538) in New York. Oracle has rallied 42% this year, compared with the 32% rise in the iShares expanded software exchange-traded fund.
 Oracle’s other big bet, the acquisition a year ago of digital health records provider Cerner Inc, now called Oracle Health, generated US$1.5bil (RM6.9bil) in the quarter. Oracle began cutting jobs in the division earlier this year after executives promised to improve profitability.
 In the current period ending in August, cloud growth excluding Oracle Health will be about 29%, Catz said. 
 Total revenue is expected to increase by 8% to 10%, she said. Analysts, on average, projected an 8% gain. 
 Profit, excluding some items, will be US$1.12 (RM5.17) to US$1.16 (RM5.36) a share.

557256,Main,22,14/06/2023,Can AI replace ghost writers?,,"LANGAT had a solid maths degree and high hopes for a career in stats when he graduated from a mid-level Kenyan university seven years ago.
 Things didn’t pan out as planned.
 So when his dream of crunching numbers for the government or teaching maths in high school both came to nought, Langat took a different route altogether.
 He signed up for a life in academic writing, a glossy term for the murky world of “contract cheating” in Kenya.
 Academic writers – aka educated young Kenyans like Langat – write essays, do assignments, and even sit exams for rich students in developed countries, largely in Europe and the United States.
 There are no reliable stats on how many Kenyans work in what is a shadow industry or the value of their output.
 “Mostly I am paid US$200-US$300 (RM919-RM1,379) monthly per student depending on what we agreed on. I write essays on nursing and healthcare in most cases,” said the 30-year-old father of one.
 Demand for paid content has mushroomed in the past decade but Langat said the market went back way longer.
 “Though most players kept it a secret, and did not say exactly what they were doing,” he explained.
 Now Langat fears his ghost-writing may be under threat from artificial intelligence (AI), which can churn out work at speed and for free.
 Microsoft’s ChatGPT chatbot – which launched last year – can generate articles, essays, jokes and even poetry in response to user prompts, circumventing the need for human cheats to carry out wealthy students’ assignments.
 According to a survey carried out in January by Study.Com, an online learning platform, , more than 89% of the 1,000-plus students questioned said they had used ChatGPT for help with homework.
 The survey found that 48% of students also admitted to using ChatGPT for a test or question at home, while 53% of them had it write an essay, and 22% had it write an outline for a paper.
 All of this undermined the shadow industry in east Africa.
 Ghost writers’ earnings vary greatly – research shows they range from 4,000 to two million Kenyan shillings (RM133 to RM66,766) a month, depending on an author’s experience, the time of year or how much work they take on.
 “At the beginning of the year, income dropped significantly because everyone had rushed to use the AI tools,” said Langat.
 But he is pinning his hopes on the human touch outsmarting AI as teachers wise up to AI’s trademark traits.
 “Some lecturers and professors are able to flag which content is original, and which is AI generated, that’s why the writing market has gone up, again,” he said.
 Kenya is a hotspot for academic writing, with many students from around the world turning to its tech-savvy, English-speaking graduates for help with essays, assignments, attending class and even sitting their exams.
 “The academic writing market is vast in the world, with notable markets in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and parts of South-east Asia,” said Langat, checking out a Facebook group of fellow writers and students with more than 170,000 members.
 The boom began a decade ago when Kenya’s academic elite left university and entered a flooded job market, finding no openings that suited their skills.
 So they found another way to use their brains and earn well.
 Laura, a 22-year-old studying statistics in Nairobi, began doubling up as an academic writer in 2021 after making about US$1,000 (RM4,590) writing an essay about nursing for a friend.
 Sensing the scale of opportunity, she launched her own account online and began dealing directly with US students who wanted ghost writers.
 Soon her business snowballed.
 “There are ratings. And once you have a good rating, jobs will come. Now I have three accounts and hire writers who are mostly students. I don’t ask my parents for money any more. Instead, I send them upkeep,” she said.
 Laura no longer dreams of typical graduate career paths as she feels no company can match her current earnings.
 “I make between US$3,000 and US$7,000 (RM13,700 and RM32,000) in a good month,” said Laura.
 The setup works for the harried Western student, too.
 Harold, a university student in the United States, said he had paid three academic writers to write six assignments for him, spending US$1,100 on four essays in the past two years.
 “I have worked with two Kenyan writers and they are good. Most of the work they do is not flagged by the professor, and I am willing to spend my pocket money to get the job done,” said Harold.
 Launched last November by San Francisco-based OpenAI, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer app in history, hitting 100 million users in two months.
 Harold tried it – with mixed results.
 “It’s not so intelligent and a good professor will be able to know what content is original,” he said.
 Academics say they can spot ChatGPT at work, citing its lack of errors and originality. “I can tell an essay from a machine and the one a student has written,” said Dickson Gekombe, an IT lecturer at Kibabii University in western Kenya. “The one written using a machine will not have spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors, the sentences just flow.”
 So while AI makes for good work – he said it also produces lazy students.

555858,StarEdu,7,11/06/2023,Five ways teachers can harness AI,"New tools, apps set to improve digital learning but prudence in their use is vital","Digital learning is expected to continue making a significant impact on education, and one of the more noteworthy advancements impacting digital learning is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). 
 It is exciting to see AI come to fruition today in a manner that is tangible, practical, widespread, and easy to use for teachers. For example, just within the last six months, we have seen phenomenal growth in generative AI apps.
 Digital learning has proved to be effective; it is now a matter of harnessing these generative AI apps to our advantage as teachers. 
 The Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) advisory note on the use of generative AI offers some tools, such as ChatGPT, Jasper AI, Craiyon, Midjourney and Synthesia, that can assist us in generating content in the form of text, images, video and audio, among others.  
 The use of these tools offers endless possibilities for teachers to increase student engagement and learning sustainability. 
 Here are five ways teachers can use these tools in the classroom: Generating discussions
 Discussions allow for a two-way engagement between both teachers and students. As teachers, we are constantly looking for ideas to excite and engage our learners, and generative AI tools can really help in this regard. 
 These tools can be used to create a set of discussion prompts related to any subject matter. They can also be used to generate questions that encourage critical thinking and discussions among students. 
 Students can also be tasked with using these tools to come up with debate points, and be taught to compare their own responses to those generated by the tools.
 Creating quizzes
 Assessments are as much part of the teaching and learning (PdP) process as the content and activities. Teachers can use AI to easily create multiple-choice quizzes on various topics that are tailored to their students’ needs and abilities, making assessments more effective and engaging.
 One example of an AI tool that can be used to create quizzes is Perplexity. It not only generates practice quiz questions with feedback, but also references the websites where these questions are sourced from.
 Designing assessment rubrics
 When creating assessment questions which are more qualitative in nature, rubrics are useful as a guide for more objective marking. 
 Teachers can use generative AI tools to design a marking rubric. The trick to amplifying these tools to our benefit is to enter the correct prompts. 
 For example, the following can be a prompt in Perplexity: “Prepare a marking rubric with descriptors to assess a two-minute video on strategic management.” 
 The AI will generate a table with each marking criterion measured against standards, with a descriptor for each criterion or standard. 
 The rubric can be further refined to ensure that it aligns with the learning outcomes and adequately assesses the desired performance. 
 It is important to check the assessment task designed using generative AI tools to ensure that the rubric is effective and accurate. 
 Personalising learning
 Generative AI can also be used to create personalised lessons for each student based on his or her learning ability and progress. 
 It analyses data on students’ performance, detects their preferences and abilities, and develops lessons that are tailored to their individual needs. 
 By using big data analytics and AI-based learning systems, teachers can gain a better understanding of each student’s learning process, which could enable them to teach more effectively. 
 Teachers can also input student answers into the generative AI tools and create personalised questions from there.
 Creating content
 In addition, teachers can use AI tools to generate comprehensive course materials, including syllabi, lesson plans and multimedia content such as video lectures and podcasts.
 Generative AI can personalise course materials, such as practice problems and interactive exercises, based on students’ knowledge gaps, skills and learning styles.
 It can also create simulations and virtual environments, which can offer more engagement and interactive courses, resulting in an improved learning experience for the students. 
 Overall, using generative AI to create content for courses can help teachers save time and provide students with engaging and effective learning materials.
 In our quest to be more digitally oriented, we need to also be wary of over-reliance on generative AI, as it can pose several risks, including discrimination and bias in the output; misinformation and disinformation as generative AI platforms can rely on inaccurate or biased sources of information; lack of transparency and accountability; and potential for misuse as unscrupulous users can exploit generative AI to create harmful content.
 To mitigate these risks, it is important to use generative AI responsibly while incorporating other teaching methods; to monitor the quality of the output generated by AI; and to ensure that AI is transparent and accountable, and that students receive a high-quality learning experience and education.

555954,Main,34,11/06/2023,World’s first AI sculpture debuts in Sweden,,"Stockholm: A historical dream team of five master sculptors, including Michelangelo, Rodin and Takamura, have trained artificial intelligence (AI) to design a sculpture dubbed The Impossible Statue, now on show in a Swedish museum.
 “This is a true statue created by five different masters that would never have been able to collaborate in real life,” said Pauliina Lunde, a spokeswoman for Swedish machine engineering group Sandvik that used three AI software programmes to create the artwork.
 Shaking up traditional conceptions about creativity and art,  the stainless steel statue depicts an androgynous person with  the lower half of the body  covered by a swath of material, holding a bronze globe in one hand.
 On show at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology (Tekniska), the statue measures 150cm and weighs 500kg.
 The idea was to create a mix of styles from five famed sculptors who each made their mark on their era: Michelangelo (Italy 1475-1564), Auguste Rodin (France 1840-1917), Kathe Kollwitz (Germany 1867-1945), Kotaro Takamura (Japan 1883-1956) and Augusta Savage (US 1892-1962).
 “Something about it makes me feel like this is not made by human being,” Julia Olderius, in charge of concept development at the museum, told AFP.
 Visitors will note the muscular body inspired by Michelangelo, and the hand holding the globe inspired by Takamura.
 Sandvik’s engineers trained the AI by feeding it a slew of images of sculptures created by the five artists.
 The software then proposed several images in 2D which it believed reflected key aspects from each of the artists.
 “In the end we had 2D images of the sculpture in which we could see the different masters reflected. Then we put these 2D images into 3D modelling,” Olderius said.
 But is it art, or technological prowess?
 “I don’t think you can define what art is. 
 “It’s up to every human being to see, ‘this is art, this is not art’. And it’s up to the audience to decide,” Olderius said.
 Amid debate about the role of AI in the art world, Olderius said she was optimistic.
 “I don’t think you have to be afraid of what AI is doing with creativity or concepts or art and design,” she said.
 “I just think you have to adapt to a new future where technology is a part of how we create concepts and art.” — AFP",stockholm historical dream team master sculptor michelangelo rodin takamura artificial intelligence design sculpture impossible statue swedish museum true statue master real life pauliina lunde spokeswoman swedish machine engineering sandvik software programme artwork traditional conception creativity stainless steel statue androgynous person half body swath material bronze globe hand swedish national museum science technology tekniska statue measure idea create mix style sculptor era michelangelo italy auguste rodin france kathe kollwitz germany kotaro takamura japan augusta savage human julia olderius charge concept development museum afp visitor muscular body michelangelo hand globe takamura sandvik engineer slew image sculpture artist software image key aspect artist image master image olderius technological prowess define art human art art audience decide debate role optimistic afraid creativity concept design adapt future technology create concept afp,"[(2, 0.99276716)]",2
555310,Main,29,09/06/2023,Britain to host  first ever  summit on AI safety,,"WASHINGTON: Britain will host a global summit on artificial intelligence safety later this year and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and US President Joe Biden discussed the technology at their meeting, the UK government said.
 The summit will consider the risks of AI, including frontier systems, and discuss how they can be mitigated through internationally coordinated action, the British government said in a statement. No date was given for the event.
 Biden and Sunak, who met yesterday for a fourth time in as many months, will work to coordinate their approaches on critical and emerging technologies, with an eye to strengthening their economic security, British and US officials said.
 US technology company Palantir Technologies, which already has more than 800 employees in Britain, will separately announce plans to make the UK its new European headquarters for AI development, the British government said.
 Sunak planned wide-ranging discussions with Biden on  the UK-US relationship and how the two countries could work together to strengthen their economies and cement their “joint leadership in the technologies of the future,” the government said.
 Several governments are considering how to mitigate the dangers of the emerging technology, which has experienced a boom in investment and consumer popularity in recent months after the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 That includes China, where the government is seeking to initiate artificial intelligence regulations, according to billionaire Elon Musk who met officials during his recent trip to China.
 Regulators globally have been scrambling to draw up rules governing the use of generative AI, which can create text and images, the impact of which proponents compare to the arrival of the internet.

554928,StarBiz,16,08/06/2023,Google AI to power virtual travel agent,New tools allow Priceline to offer chatbot planning,"NEW YORK: Want a New York hotel near a Christmas market, a vegan restaurant or another attraction?
 Look no further than artificial intelligence (AI) from Google at Priceline as early as this summer, the companies told Reuters.
 The online travel agency, part of Booking Holdings, aims to debut a more sophisticated chatbot for planning trips as well as hotel suggestions that are like “a personal concierge” tailored to users, said Martin Brodbeck, Priceline’s chief technology officer.
 “You can easily find out that in Bryant Park there’s a Christmas market that runs from early November all the way through the beginning of January when you’re actually booking your hotel,” said Brodbeck.
 New tools from Google’s cloud division give Priceline access to generative AI, like the technology behind ChatGPT, which can draft text as if a human wrote it. 
 The tools also extract information, such as hotel prices, from existing data to ensure accuracy.
 For Google, drawing business through AI represents a potential way to close the gap with rivals Amazon and Microsoft, as it has long been a distant No. 3 provider of cloud services like data storage.
 For Priceline, the embrace of novel technology on its website may help it vie with myriad platforms that market travel options, some of which are exploring how consumers react to AI.
 Its rival, Expedia Group, has said ChatGPT would power conversations on a smartphone app. 
 That is giving travellers “inspiration on places to go” and booking options, said Rathi Murthy, its chief technology officer.
 Both Expedia and Kayak, another site owned by Booking Holdings, have integrated their travel suggestions through features in the standalone ChatGPT programme as well.
 And Google itself has long represented competition for Priceline, though Brodbeck said its cloud capabilities were what led to the partnership.
 The ability to build applications atop generative AI that Google pioneered has attracted recent business, said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud’s chief executive officer.
 “There is a kind of Cambrian moment happening now where there’s an explosion of this technology,” Kurian told Reuters, referring to the extraordinary prehistoric period when a wide array of new species emerged, but he declined to answer how free corporate previews were affecting Google Cloud’s profitability.
 Google’s AI will generate coding suggestions for hundreds of software developers at Priceline, said Brodbeck. 
 Priceline will adopt Google’s search capabilities for employee intranets. And Google’s AI will speed up marketing for trending destinations.

553608,Lifestyle,5,05/06/2023,AI threatens women’s jobs,,"WHILE artificial intelligence (AI) is seeding upheaval across the workforce, from screenwriters to financial advisors, the technology will disproportionately replace jobs typically held by women, according to human resources analytics firm Revelio Labs.
 “The distribution of genders across occupations reflects the biases deeply rooted in our society, with women often being confined to roles such as administrative assistants and secretaries,” said Hakki Ozdenoren, economist at Revelio Labs. 
 “Consequently, the impact of AI becomes skewed along gender lines.”
 Revelio Labs identified jobs that are most likely to be replaced by AI based on a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
 It then identified the gender breakdown of those jobs and found that many of them are generally held by women, such as bill and account collectors, payroll clerks and executive secretaries.
 Advances in AI are aggravating gender disparity in the global workforce, where companies are considering cutting some staff and leveraging generative AI in their workflow. 
 IBM recently said it’s slowing down hiring for roles that can be easily replaced by AI in back-office functions, such as human resources. 
 CEO Arvind Krishna predicts that as many as 30% of these positions could be replaced by automation over the next five years, potentially resulting in a loss of around 7,800 jobs.
 AI is more likely to take over repetitive jobs, the kind that are mostly held by women. For example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT model can search, review and summarise large volumes of text quickly, tasks that would normally take paralegals much longer to accomplish. 
 In recruitment, AI can automate the process of sorting through resumes, a task that used to require more people, Ozdenoren said. But it doesn’t mean that other highly skilled workers can feel secure about their jobs. 
 Preliminary research also shows that generative AI may impact high-wage occupations more than non-traditional manufacturing jobs, according to Revelio Labs.
 “Moving forward, providing retraining opportunities will be key for women to navigate the evolving job landscape,” Ozdenoren said. 
 “By doing so, we can capitalise on the potential of AI while leveraging their valuable skills and expertise,” he said. – Bloomberg/Tribune News Service",artificial intelligence upheaval workforce screenwriter financial advisor technology job woman human resource analytics firm revelio lab distribution gender occupation bias society woman role administrative assistant secretary ozdenoren economist revelio lab impact gender line lab job national bureau economic gender breakdown job woman bill collector clerk executive secretary gender disparity global workforce company staff generative ibm role office function human resource krishna predicts position automation loss job repetitive job woman openai chatgpt model search review summarise volume text task paralegal accomplish recruitment automate process resume task people skilled worker secure job preliminary generative impact wage occupation traditional manufacturing job lab opportunity key woman job landscape ozdenoren potential valuable skill bloomberg tribune news service,"[(2, 0.66515434), (5, 0.3275227)]",2
553692,StarBiz,7,05/06/2023,MBCS sees opportunity to leverage on AI,"Balance between human creativity, technology vital","PETALING JAYA: Mediabrands Content Studio (MBCS), the media-fuelled creative content agency within the IPG Mediabrands network, recently announced key updates to its leadership team in Malaysia, in the form of a Creative Leadership Council.
 In responding to queries from StarBiz, Stanley Clement, chief executive officer of MBCS Malaysia and newly minted executive creative director of MBCS Andrew Shee elucidated some of the developments trending in the advertising industry and how the agency viewed them.
 Below are the excerpts of the interview.
 StarBiz:  Innovation and artificial intelligence (AI) of late have been hogging the headlines. What has the agency done in this space? And how is this shaping creativity today and how can creatives work together with the technology?
 Clement: AI is shaping the face of creativity today, providing us with advanced tools, content generation capabilities, personalised recommendations, data-driven insights and collaborative platforms, all of which can enhance the way we do our work as creatives.
 Within the agency, we are embracing AI as a tool, ensuring we have a good repository of AI tools that help very much in the thinking and groundwork.
 However, we are extremely careful and measured of its usage, especially with the end output.
 While working with this technology, it is important to strike a balance between human creativity and AI assistance, as we look to continuously learn, adapt and consider the ethical implications of its usage. 
 Ultimately, human input in creativity and innovation leads the way.
 Most importantly, MBCS and the Creative Leadership Council see an opportunity to leverage AI’s capabilities while infusing a unique artistic vision for creatives to unlock new possibilities and navigate the evolving creative landscape, which will be very exciting for brands today.
 Shee: Technology allows creativity to flourish and continues to amaze us every day. Because technology is everywhere around us, and so much more accessible, creatives need to understand better how tech can enhance people’s lives and build creative ideas around it.
 Within MBCS, we are making a concerted effort to enrich our creatives in the space of AI through specialised and practical workshops which will help them strategise better alongside AI to do a variety of things across consumer analysis, eCommerce and even sustainability efforts.
 In terms of creativity, where does Malaysia stand compared with its regional peers? How can we boost the creativity level in the ad industry locally, and any measures to spur creative talents?
 Clement: The ad industry locally definitely needs reinvigoration.
 Executions and plans in the last few years have been largely tactical, focused on finding the cheapest solution to market.
 This has not been a good thing as the core idea of building brands long-term has taken a backseat, and we are looking at pricing in the first instance, rather than the real opportunity to grow brand value.
 This needs to be balanced better, otherwise brands will lose out in the long run.
 Shee: Malaysia has amazing creative talents both locally and abroad who are showcasing their creativity in many other fields beyond advertising.
 However more effort needs to go into marketing ourselves better to gain global recognition and acknowledgement.
 While there are rules and regulations that sometimes stifle creatives, the truth is this is prevalent everywhere in the world. 
 Instead, creatives need to challenge themselves to work around the rules to create something that moves people and changes behaviours or mindsets.
 This is why tech and data science is so exciting, as there lies opportunities for us to manoeuvre around obstacles to achieve the creativity we aspire for.
 We are now in the age where AI is threatening to take over our jobs – especially so in the creative marketing industry.
 Instead of fearing this, we need to embrace AI and use it purposefully, knowing that at the end of the day, humans are the heart of AI.
 This business is still very much a people business and should always be driven by human truths in everything we do.
 Could you delve on the challenges faced by the creative leadership?Clement: Primarily, our main challenges lie in managing the expectation of the clients.
 There is a high expectation for us to constantly bring great ideas to the table, yet there is a natural limit on solutions which are highly social or that can trend-jack positively.
 Thus, delivery with frequency of this nature is challenging, and makes it challenging for us to constantly inspire the young creatives.
 Shee: I firmly believe in creative leadership taking a proactive role to inspire and guide the next generation of creative talents, but the biggest challenge is how we do it.
 Ways of the past do not apply in today’s climate.
 Leaders need to drop fixed expectations to better understand the ways of the next generation before guiding them.
 Being empathetic towards one another and working together towards a common goal is an important part of the inspiration process.
 Importantly, we need to keep nurturing our local talent to ensure they do not move away from creative industries.
 Any other relevant trends or insights driving the advertising landscape?
 Clement: We are seeing greater opportunities within performance creative as it is an essential way for brands to quickly and effectively reach their audience, as they seek to drive higher conversions by targeting specific audiences, optimise based on data, and focus on measurable results.
 To this end, MBCS has a full performance creative team that works closely alongside the media teams to ensure that brands stand out, engage their audience, and achieve their marketing goals effectively and efficiently.",jaya mediabrands content studio mbcs medium creative content agency network key update leadership team malaysia form creative leadership council query stanley clement chief executive officer mbcs malaysia executive creative director mbcs elucidated development advertising industry agency excerpt interview innovation artificial intelligence late hogging headline agency space creativity creatives technology clement creativity advanced tool content generation capability recommendation data insight platform creatives agency tool repository tool groundwork careful usage output technology strike balance human creativity assistance learn adapt ethical implication human input creativity innovation mbcs creative leadership council opportunity leverage capability unique artistic vision creatives unlock possibility creative landscape brand shee technology creativity flourish amaze day technology accessible creatives tech enhance people build creative idea effort enrich space practical workshop variety consumer analysis ecommerce sustainability effort term creativity malaysia regional peer creativity level industry spur creative talent clement industry reinvigoration execution tactical cheapest solution market core idea brand term backseat pricing instance real opportunity grow brand brand lose shee malaysia creative talent creativity field effort marketing gain global recognition acknowledgement rule regulation creatives prevalent creatives rule move people mindset tech data science lie opportunity obstacle creativity aspire age job creative marketing industry embrace day human heart business people business human truth challenge creative leadership clement main challenge expectation client idea table natural limit solution social trend jack delivery frequency nature creatives creative leadership proactive role inspire guide generation creative talent biggest challenge apply climate leader expectation generation guiding empathetic common goal inspiration process local talent creative industry trend insight advertising landscape clement opportunity performance creative essential brand audience seek drive conversion specific audience data measurable mbcs performance creative team alongside medium team brand engage audience achieve marketing goal,"[(2, 0.9968357)]",2
552832,Lifestyle,7,04/06/2023,"Use AI, sure – but fact check","The power lies not only with the pen – and now AI – and the person wielding it, but also the reader and how prudent we are in accepting those words.","IMPLICIT in the phrase “The pen is mightier than the sword” is the idea that to persuade people with your writing takes a degree of skill. That a random jumble of words needs the energy of somebody who knows what they are doing to create order and sense.
 But what if it’s machines that unjumble those words? 
 Despite what years of movies have told me about the Terminator or HAL, I refuse to believe that when computers become intelligent enough, they will turn evil and take over the world. What is more likely is that people will be dumb enough to believe computers and end up doing stupid things that destroy the world.
 I had a chat with someone who was appalled at how an artificial intelligence (AI) research tool returned seemingly promising but ultimately fake URLs. “It’s so dangerous!” she exclaimed.
 It’s true. Just ask Steven Schwartz, an American lawyer who has been called up by the court to explain how he used an AI tool to assist in writing court filings that cited six nonexistent cases. When he was asked to explain whether these cases were authentic, he said yes by referring back to the same AI tool for confirmation.
 To me, the obvious issue isn’t that the AI tool spouted nonsense; it was that the person using it couldn’t tell the difference between good output and bad output. We need to learn to be able to tell the difference.
 A professor in an American university set his undergraduate class the following assignment: Students were asked to use AI to generate essays using a given prompt, and then critically evaluate the output. In particular, they were told to fact check the information and critique the analysis.
 Every one of his 63 students discovered that their generated essay contained some form of inaccuracy, and half of them said they had been unaware that AI could be wrong. Upon reflection, the professor’s students themselves pointed out the dangers of overrelying on AI to “get things right”. One student said: “I’m not worried about AI getting to where we are now. I’m much more worried about the possibility of us reverting to where AI is.”
 Of course, the clever people making these AI tools have been trying to find ways to make sure the next iteration doesn’t make these kinds of mistakes, or at least highlights where it might have gone wrong.
 For example, the folks at OpenAI have introduced a version of ChatGPT that can also browse the Internet to get the information it needs. If you ask it to write about something, it will annotate the resulting text to show you which website it found the information on.
 Of course, you have to then read that original webpage source and try to determine if it is accurate and true. Although AI can help you draft the article and find the source webpages, you still ultimately have to do the fact checking.
 It was pointed out that this was reminiscent of Wikipedia when it first became popular. We were told we shouldn’t use it because we don’t know how much of what was on it was true. Anybody could contribute to Wikipedia, and nobody knows whether the facts are reliable or not.
 Over time, instead of becoming unreliable as a source of information, Wikipedia became a convenient port of first call for a quick overview. However, we learned that for critical portions, it really was better to find alternative sources to back up what was found in Wikipedia.
 In the same way Wikipedia is not a source of truth, but a tool to help corral facts, these new AI writing tools are not about writing the truth, but about how to present facts it thinks it knows in a very human-like way.
 If it’s so good at writing readable first drafts, then why don’t we use it to write stories? Well, Amir Muhammed, the founder of local publishing company Buku Fixi, is open to the idea, stating, “The kind of stories that do well are the ones that get positive word of mouth – by human readers. If something by an AI manages to achieve that, we won’t stand in the way of reader enjoyment.”
 In fact, the main concern for book publishers seems to be the issue of authenticity, in this case of human intellectual property. Can an author claim to be the creator if he uses a mishmash of words generated by another? If yes, then if those “other words” he uses are found to be very similar to some already existing piece of work, can the author be accused of plagiarism?
 When it comes to writing, the notion of “truth” carries different implications for legal submissions, academic essays, and works of fiction. For legal submissions and university essays, the concern is whether they are consistent with verifiable facts. For pieces of fiction, it’s whether the words evoke the writer’s intended meanings and emotions beyond a simple “cut and paste”.
 In all cases, it should be obvious that the power lies not only with the pen and the person wielding it, but also the reader and how prudent we are in accepting those words.

 BTRU.ai is Soh’s answer to the widespread and unregulated development of AI in health sites that can lead to public harm.
 “When you are on Google [looking for answers] about diabetes, for example, you will get advertisements, [come across] unreliable health sources, and be misinformed. These are the problems that people don’t think about,” says Soh, who is currently undergoing housemanship training in London.
 And more importantly, the answers provided by BTRU.ai are based on verified sources including the UK’s National Health Service and the World Health Organisation.
 The beta version of BTRU.ai was launched last Sunday and public response has been positive so far.
 BTRU.ai strives to be a one-stop centre to provide credible answers. The replies are personalised to the person typing the questions and the AI will even provide links for further reading.
 “I have been trying to solve the problem of finding reliable information and I believe that I am on that mission to tackle it, “ he says. 
 Soh believes that people have the right to educate themselves about their health or, better still, become more aware of their health problems.
 “Can you imagine, regardless of background or wealth, someone who has not studied medicine can use this piece of technology and get the best health information?” he says.
 “Type your question in the search tool and you will get replies in the natural English language, producing information which breaks away from jargon.” 
 He says BTRU.ai streamlines information that is already available.
 “I am not writing a piece of new information on [for example] diabetes. We are constructing an organised response which will tell you what you need to know about the condition.”
 BTRU was inspired by Soh’s experience in leading his previous movement.
 “I got the experience in [addressing] misinformation and after working on it for such a long time, now I wanted to make it a bit practical.
 “I understand that not everyone has been to medical school, or is able to navigate online and work out whether this or that is a reliable site. Technology should come into play to help leverage which website is reputable or otherwise.”
 Medicine and AI 
 On Tuesday, AI industry leaders in the United States, in a joint statement, called for mitigation efforts against the risk of extinction caused by the unregulated development of AI.
 “The statement highlights wide-ranging concerns about the ultimate danger of unchecked artificial intelligence.
 “Still, the flood of hype and investment into the AI industry has led to calls for regulation at the outset of the AI age, before any major mishaps occur.
 “The statement follows the viral success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has helped heighten an ‘arms race’ in the tech industry over artificial intelligence. In response, a growing number of lawmakers, advocacy groups and tech insiders have raised alarms about the potential for a new crop of AI-powered chatbots to spread misinformation and displace jobs,” CNN reported.
 A similar concern is voiced by Soh when asked about the challenges as well as ethics concerning the use of AI.
 He says there are several challenges faced when developing BTRU.ai in efforts to prevent future problems which can affect health services, for example. Among the potential issues are people self-diagnosing themselves through the use of AI and the health industry’s possible reluctance in implementing the technology due to cost.
 “For example, when Facebook was founded it was meant to help people connect but people never thought about the mental health issues that came along. 
 “I want to be ethical. I want to be conscientious in what I do.”
 He highlighted a health check site which also utilises AI but which potentially leads to harm; the site offers diagnoses and self-treatment advice. This is despite AI’s current state in which it has yet to reach a level of sophistication that can provide actual medical diagnoses.
 “This is what happens when you are not conscientious and create a problem. These are some of the things I see people trying to build. People are trying to create their own AI tools, try to diagnose and treat themselves,” Soh says.
 The site is said to have been founded by an individual frustrated by physicians who apparently did not diagnose his/her medical condition. 
 “So people with non-healthcare backgrounds are creating products for healthcare which they may not know how it works. This is scary.
 “I took a few years [to come up with BTRU.ai]. I had to speak to professors and consultants, run tests and work through the legality.”
 A better future
 Soh’s eyes light up at our next question: will BTRU.ai ultimately aid doctors in their work? 
 “We want to overcome GDPR (general data protection regulation) and data compliance issues. We have yet to successfully go over that. We will, in time.
 “But when we do, with your consent [to share data] we will then learn the way you search [on BTRU].”
 And here is the “magic” as described by Soh: a user’s unique search traits will help BTRU form a picture of his or her condition before the person arrives physically at the hospital.
 “Currently, what people have trained the AI on is based on the data about patients already in the hospital. But not the data on what happened when they were not in the hospital. [For instance] if they had searched about a headache three weeks ago.”
 Soh says there is a goldmine of health data which does not exist right now, concerning people’s search habits before they seek medical help.
 When combined with existing data, doctors will have a clearer picture with which to come to a diagnosis.
 “But as of at this point, we are not there yet. That’s what I think in the future, as one of the means to help with diagnoses.”",artificial intelligence medical inquiry global norm personalised reply health site regarded convenient people answer seek understanding site strives rest btru malaysian medical student ian soh independent global covid youth movement moreviralthanthevirus johorean team btru seamless experience potential patient health blue white colour theme site simplicity serf educate mass query medical advice treatment btru soh answer widespread unregulated development health site public harm google answer advertisement unreliable health source people housemanship training answer btru verified source national health service health organisation beta version btru sunday public response positive btru strives credible answer reply person question provide link solve reliable mission tackle soh people health aware health imagine wealth medicine piece technology health type question search tool reply natural english language break jargon btru streamlines piece diabetes organised response condition btru soh experience previous movement experience misinformation time practical understand medical school navigate online reliable site technology play leverage reputable medicine tuesday industry leader joint statement mitigation effort risk extinction unregulated development statement highlight wide concern ultimate danger artificial intelligence flood hype investment industry call regulation age major mishap statement viral success openai chatgpt arm race tech industry artificial intelligence response lawmaker tech insider alarm potential crop chatbots misinformation displace job cnn concern soh challenge challenge btru effort future health service potential issue people health industry reluctance technology cost facebook meant people people mental health issue conscientious health check site utilises harm site diagnosis treatment advice current reach level sophistication actual medical diagnosis conscientious people people tool treat soh site individual frustrated physician medical condition people product healthcare scary btru speak professor consultant test legality soh eye light question btru aid doctor gdpr data protection regulation data compliance issue time consent share data search btru magic soh user unique search trait form picture condition person hospital people data patient hospital data hospital instance headache week goldmine health data people habit medical data doctor picture diagnosis future diagnosis,"[(1, 0.082883224), (5, 0.9147334)]",5
553070,Main,28,04/06/2023,AI could sway US’  2024 elections — but not like you think,Campaign professionals worry that artificial intelligence will have troubling implications for a political system already beset by misinformation.,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence could transform politics as profoundly as television or radio, providing the early masters of the nascent technology a sizeable – and perhaps decisive – advantage in the upcoming elections.
 But even as campaign professionals embrace AI, they worry that the newfound ability to quickly and cheaply generate convincingly deceptive audio and video has troubling implications for a political system already beset by misinformation. How can voters hold politicians accountable for their failings if they believe those failings are fake? How will campaign professionals respond when their candidates are smeared with fabricated “recordings”?
 Despite the widespread anxiety over deepfakes’ effects on democracy, political consultants in the United States say they are more excited about generative AI’s potential to tackle boring grunt work and expand their ability to deploy big-race tactics in down-ballot contests.
 AI’s real impact on campaigning will be “behind the scenes,” said Tom Newhouse, vice president of digital marketing at Converge Media, a Republican advertising and consulting firm. 
 “It’s going to be improving fundraising capabilities by better targeting, whether that is location targeting, income, hobbies or habits, providing campaigns with up-to-date voter data, more personalised advertising, [or] messages.”
 “There are many small campaigns that I think can potentially leverage the tools to [not just] save time, but to create content that may not have been possible otherwise,” said Larry Huynh, a partner at Trilogy Interactive, a Democratic digital marketing firm.
 Campaign professionals across the US are now racing to see how they can use these new machine-learning tools to supercharge their work in advance of their first big test: the 2024 presidential elections.
 “Anyone who wants to do their job better here – and in any industry, let alone politics  – is trying to see how the tool can be beneficial to their work,” said Huynh, who is also the incoming president of the American Association of Political Consultants.
 The election pros that CQ Roll Call spoke to all expect AI to give some tech-savvy candidates a big leg up on their opponents. 
 “Campaigns that can innovate and lean into these tactics are going to have a strategic advantage,” said Newhouse.
 From fireside chats to ChatGPT
 With new technologies came newfound boons to politicians who knew how to use them — or, more accurately, find someone who did. Barack Obama’s campaigns expanded on data-driven strategies to organise grassroots enthusiasm into an army of volunteers, while Donald Trump’s team benefited from Cambridge Analytica’s mining of voters’ social media data.
 “These are the political campaigns that told industry and private practice and commercial industries how to best leverage these tools,” said Newhouse, describing campaigns as “laboratories of innovation.”
 Newhouse thinks those competitive pressures could mean that electioneering, itself a multibillion-dollar industry, might lead the corporate sector on adopting AI. 
 “As you look forward [to the 2024 elections], political campaigns are going to be incentivised to use these technologies quicker than you might see in the private markets,” he said.
 AI is already being used in politics. After President Joe Biden announced his reelection campaign, the Republican National Committee released an AI-generated video that envisioned a dystopian future wrought by his four more years in office. 
 Campaigns have used machine-learning models to guide their ad buys on social media platforms like Facebook for years now. Right now, though, it’s the potential to use large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT to update voter files, perform data analysis and program automated functions that excite political operatives the most. While well-funded Senate or gubernatorial races can afford to hire data scientists to crunch numbers, smaller campaigns rarely have that luxury, said Colin Strother, a Democratic political consultant based in Texas. AI will change that.
 “I’m excited about some of the brute work that would be really great to do, but  – unless you’re on a big-time campaign, with a ton of money and a ton of staff  – you can’t afford to do,” Strother said.
 Strother thinks AI will let campaigns upgrade their microtargeting operations into hypertargeting and speed up their rapid response operations. An AI-powered chatbot fed with an opponent’s every public utterance and voting record could churn out instantaneous rebuttals to whatever they say in a speech, debate or campaign ad. He also expects campaigns to use AI to update voter databases in real time, perform trend analyses and send tailored communications to different tranches of voters. Those could be persuasive pitches to undecided independents on the issues that probably matter most to them or fundraising appeals to stronger supporters playing on their biggest fears if their candidate loses. 
 “If you can automate all of that, then these previously time-intensive, labour-intensive and therefore cash-intensive campaign functions get a lot easier to do and a lot cheaper to accomplish,” Strother said.
 Huynh also sees AI levelling the playing field somewhat between well-heeled and poorer campaigns. His agency has already played around with AI to create a video that portrayed one client as a superhero. It’s the kind of project that would have required renting out a studio with green screens, blocking off hours of the client’s time and hiring some computer animators and editors to put it all together — but, with AI, was created “for fun” in no time at all.
 Already the proliferation of high-end video editing software and improved cameras has meant that any candidate for town dogcatcher with an artsy nephew can put together a slick campaign ad, even if they can’t afford to run it anywhere but their own YouTube page. AI will only supercharge that trend, said Huynh.
 “You’ll see some examples of content and video graphics images that that generative AI will make possible for leaner campaigns to do that they wouldn’t have been able to do otherwise,” he said.
 As a result, for most voters, the rise of AI might not mean being bombarded by hard-to-spot political lies so much as just being bombarded by political content in general. The history of technology’s impact on work suggests campaigns will be able to do more with less, and thus will make more of the election stuff that inundates and annoys voters: more online ads, polls, texts, emails, fundraising appeals, emotional manipulation and another hive dumped on top of the growing swarm of robocalls incessantly buzzing our cellphones.
 The potential for bad actors to abuse AI also worries campaign professionals.
 “From a professional standpoint, I’m excited,” said Newhouse. “From a personal standpoint, it’s tough not to get concerned that the trends of the last decade are going to continue as far as laying the burden at the feet of the voters to figure out what’s true and what’s false.”
 Earlier this month, AAPC released a policy statement forbidding its members from using generative AI to create deepfakes that mislead the public. But Huynh knows not every operative will abide by the trade group’s ethical standards. 
 “I expect some campaigns to implement things that we believe are inappropriate, not good for campaigns and not good for democracy,” said Huynh. “There will be thousands and thousands of campaigns that happen in 2024. It would be silly to dismiss that possibility.”
 Strother’s primary concern is AI’s ability to flood the zone with misinformation, creating “chaos,” which disproportionately turns off the more moderate voters who don’t view politics as an extension of their social identity. 
 “If we’re creating homework for them – and they now have to figure out which one of us is telling the truth [and] which one of us is lying  – they’re going to bail because they’re not looking for extra work to do,” he said.
 Regulation to the rescue?
 Given that Congress has yet to pass legislation regulating how social media companies utilise user data, some advocates worry lawmakers will similarly fail to act quickly on AI. But AI’s ability to generate election-swaying deceptions is far more obvious than social media influence on votes. 
 A deepfake’s ability to fool voters is readily apparent to lawmakers, and at a recent hearing, many sounded receptive to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s calls for a new federal agency to regulate AI and support for disclosure rules.
 But even if Congress does act quickly, there are questions of how much it’ll help.
 Given the prevalence of dark money political groups, the First Amendment’s broad protections of political speech and the fact that defamation lawsuits take years to resolve themselves, the schemers behind a libellous deepfake could potentially avoid any liability by hiding behind the organisation’s corporate veil. 
 “It really opens the door for some really nasty stuff,” said Strother.
 People are prone to logical hiccups like politically motivated reasoning, whereby the desire to maintain a socially held belief overpowers our ability to grapple with a truth that challenges those convictions. And then there is confirmation basis: accepting information that confirms our prior beliefs while dismissing data that confounds them. That means that once a false conviction is set, subsequent fact checking may not be enough to dislodge that fantasy. 
 Despite hundreds of court cases, audits and media reports proving otherwise, polls  consistently show that a majority of Republican primary voters believe the 2020 elections were stolen. So a computer-fabricated recording of President Joe Biden purporting to admit to such a plot wouldn’t need to be good to be effective. It doesn’t take much to convince the faithful that devils walk among us.
 Those worries over AI may be overblown or premature. So far, political deepfakes have been more amusing than malicious. But the technology is advancing rapidly, leading to uncertainty over its potential for good or ill, and uncertainty tends to compound anxiety. 
 That may be why the political consultants experimenting the most with AI are the least bothered about its downsides  – although they’re still concerned.
 Even as he continues to expand his work with AI, Newhouse hesitates to make predictions on its impact without a caveat.
 “If we talked about this technology six, seven months ago, you’d probably get a blank stare,” said Newhouse. 
 “So to predict another six, seven months in the future, let alone 16 months in the future to the November 2024 elections, it’s difficult to say what that looks like.” — CQ-Roll Call/TNS",artificial intelligence transform politics television radio master nascent technology sizeable decisive advantage upcoming election campaign professional newfound ability cheaply generate deceptive audio video implication political system misinformation voter politician accountable failing failing campaign professional candidate fabricated recording widespread anxiety deepfakes effect political consultant excited generative potential tackle grunt expand ability deploy race tactic ballot contest real impact scene vice president digital marketing converge medium republican advertising firm capability location income hobby campaign data advertising message leverage tool time create content larry huynh partner trilogy interactive democratic digital marketing firm campaign professional machine learning tool advance test presidential election job industry politics beneficial huynh president american association political consultant election pro call expect tech savvy candidate opponent campaign innovate lean tactic strategic advantage fireside chat technology boon politician obama campaign data strategy grassroots army volunteer trump team cambridge analytica mining voter social medium data political campaign industry private practice commercial industry tool campaign laboratory competitive pressure multibillion dollar industry lead corporate sector forward election political campaign technology private market politics president joe biden reelection campaign republican national committee generated video dystopian future office campaign machine model buy social medium platform potential language model chatgpt update voter file data analysis program function political operative senate gubernatorial race hire data scientist campaign colin democratic political consultant texas change brute time campaign ton money ton staff afford strother strother campaign upgrade operation speed rapid response operation chatbot opponent public utterance voting record churn instantaneous rebuttal speech debate campaign campaign update voter database real time trend analysis communication tranche voter pitch undecided independent issue appeal stronger supporter biggest fear loses automate time intensive labour intensive cash intensive campaign function easier lot cheaper accomplish strother huynh field poorer campaign agency create video client superhero project renting studio green screen hour client time computer animator editor fun time proliferation video software camera meant candidate town dogcatcher artsy nephew slick campaign afford youtube supercharge trend huynh content video graphic image leaner campaign result voter hard spot political lie political content history technology impact campaign election stuff voter ad poll email appeal emotional manipulation hive top swarm robocalls cellphone potential bad actor worry campaign professional professional standpoint personal standpoint tough concerned trend decade burden foot voter true month policy statement generative create deepfakes public huynh operative trade ethical standard campaign implement inappropriate campaign democracy huynh thousand thousand campaign dismiss possibility primary concern ability flood misinformation chaos moderate voter politics social identity homework figure truth bail extra regulation rescue congress pas legislation social medium company data advocate lawmaker ability generate election deception obvious social medium influence vote ability fool voter apparent lawmaker receptive openai ceo sam altman federal agency support disclosure rule question prevalence dark money political amendment broad protection political speech defamation lawsuit schemer libellous avoid liability organisation corporate veil door nasty stuff strother people logical hiccup desire maintain belief overpowers ability truth challenge conviction basis accepting prior belief data confounds false conviction subsequent checking dislodge hundred court medium report poll majority republican primary voter election computer president joe biden admit plot effective convince faithful devil worry overblown premature political deepfakes malicious technology uncertainty potential uncertainty compound anxiety political consultant downside concerned newhouse prediction impact caveat technology month blank stare predict month future month future november election difficult roll call tn,"[(0, 0.998351)]",0
552212,StarBiz,4,02/06/2023,Artificial intelligence craze leaves crypto for dust,,"BITCOIN is undeniably having a great year, but is losing momentum just when it might have been expected to go up a gear.
 Its traditionally strong and positive correlation with technology stocks, in particular the “mega tech” and growth stocks that have exploded higher in recent weeks, has completely broken down.Bitcoin’s rolling 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq last week flipped to its most negative in six months, and its correlation with the NYSE FANG+TM index of mega tech and growth equity plunged to its most negative in nearly four years.
 The recent burst of investor optimism that the boom in artificial intelligence (AI), ChatGPT software and advanced microchip technology will be transformational for economies is driving the surge in Big Tech.
 Crypto might have been expected to ride on the coat tails, but hasn’t. Bitcoin peaked above US$31,000 (RM142,910) in mid-April for a year-to-date gain of almost 90%, but is now trading back at US$27,000 (RM124,470), paring its 2023 gains to around 63%.
 As billions of dollars have flooded into Big Tech over the last six weeks, bitcoin trading volumes and demand have slumped.
 Matt Weller, analyst at StoneX, said there just doesn’t seem to be a compelling reason to buy bitcoin right now and the AI boom still has legs.
 “ChatGPT is what crypto wants to be – an instant-use, mass-market product with huge adoption rates,” he said, adding: “Crypto has lost its luster amid this gold rush. Or should I say, AI rush.”
 The magnificent seven
 Bitcoin, crypto assets more broadly and technology stocks have traditionally moved in tandem on the assumption that they will all be fundamental parts of the disruptive, growth-generating and efficient economies of the future.
 Weller reckoned the divergence really widened on April 25 when Microsoft was the first of the United States tech giants to report forecast-beating quarterly results.
 Since April 25, the NYSE FANG+TM index of big tech and growth stocks has surged 24%, nearly three times the broader Nasdaq. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is down around 1% in more erratic trading.
 Whatever is buoying mega tech is not floating bitcoin’s boat.
 The AI boom has gathered momentum despite the rise in bond yields and discount rates. 
 This has highlighted bitcoin’s underperformance and strongly suggests that outside the rarified world of Big Tech, investors are much more discerning.
 Indeed, just seven US tech stocks have driven all of the positive S&P 500 returns so far this year, according to analysts at Barclays.
 Zooming out further, if bitcoin is the dollar hedge that its enthusiasts claim it to be, then it faces stiff headwinds from a “higher for longer” Fed and rising US yields that are pushing the dollar higher again.
 Analysts at retail trading research firm Vanda Research pointed out that while retail investors have only been “marginal” participants in the recent AI and tech boom, they have turned even cooler on crypto assets.
 Their flows data show that rotation out of crypto stocks into AI names has pushed crypto inflows to the post-pandemic lows, down to US$3.6mil (RM16.5mil) a day from comfortably over US$10mil (RM46mil) a day a few weeks earlier.
 “Should AI stocks’ outperformance extend further, we anticipate retail traders will start chasing other names more aggressively, further reducing the demand for crypto names,” Vanda analysts wrote last week.
 Vanda’s Marco Iachini said he is surprised cryptocurrencies have not followed tech higher. They will catch up at some point, but not before the AI rally broadens out to smaller cap tech and growth stocks first.
 How much can bitcoin rally? Standard Chartered analysts reckon it could reach US$100,000 (RM460,000) by the end of 2024. 
 The so-called “crypto winter” may have passed, but it would require a dramatic turnaround in investor sentiment and crypto usage for that to become reality. — Reuters

552224,StarBiz,9,02/06/2023,Why are AI chip stocks soaring? Is the rally sustainable?,,"SINGAPORE: Chipmaker Nvidia briefly touched a stock market valuation of US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion) on Tuesday, making it the first chipmaker to hit that major milestone.
 The shares began trading at around US$397 (RM1,831) apiece on Wednesday, giving it a market valuation of US$988.7bil (RM4.56 trillion).
 Fewer than 10 stocks have ever topped the US$1 trillion threshold, and with Nvidia’s milestone, it joins Alphabet and Amazon.com among US companies currently trading above this level. 
 Both Apple and Microsoft are valued above US$2 trillion (RM9.2 trillion).
 Buoyed by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Nvidia shares have soared by about 180% so far this year.
 Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, which includes Nvidia and other AI semiconductor heavyweights such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcomm, is up more than 40%.
 In comparison, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is up by just over 25%.
 Nvidia is now the world’s biggest maker of the specialised chips needed to power generative AI, a new generation of AI technology.
 Demand for the chips was triggered by the viral success of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot that can understand the context of complex queries and generate coherent answers in a conversational, human-like manner.
 Last week, Nvidia issued an AI-fuelled sales forecast of US$11bil (RM51bil) for its second quarter, beating Wall Street targets by a long mile and resulting in its value jumping by US$184bil (RM845bil) in a single day.
 During its earnings call, the company said generative AI is driving exponential growth in computing requirements, which in turn drove demand for its specialised graphics chips. 
 It claimed that the chips can handle AI workloads better than standard processors.
 Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang has since also unveiled an AI supercomputer platform that will help tech companies create their own versions of ChatGPT.
 Nvidia’s share price rally has lifted other AI semiconductor stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell Technology, which are up by 92% and 75% respectively since the start of the year.
 Prices of shares in companies like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, which have invested in generative AI, have also risen.
 AEM Holdings was among the beneficiaries of the AI rally in the United States.
 Shares of the firm, which provides testing equipment and services to the semiconductor industry, have risen by 12.5% over the past week to close at S$3.60 (US$2.60 or RM12) on Wednesday.
 In a recent business update on May 11, AEM said: “Recent excitement over generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is fuelling the demand for AI-focused semiconductor devices to enable these solutions to be delivered to the masses at economically feasible rates.”
 AEM noted that this would, in turn, drive demand for its products and services.
 UMS Holdings saw its shares rise by over 8.7% in the past week, to S$1.06 (RM3.62) on Wednesday. 
 It provides equipment manufacturing and engineering services to the semiconductor industry.
 Both AEM and UMS are among the most heavily traded tech stocks on the Singapore Exchange.
 Experts agreed that demand for generative AI will only grow in the years to come.
 Associate Prof James Pang, co-director of the NUS Business Analytics Centre, said the current surge in demand for generative AI is warranted and is not just hype.
 “Generative AI is a big improvement for AI as a whole as it can be used across industries,” he said, adding that over the longer term, it will transform content generation functions and that companies could develop their own generative AI models to raise efficiency.
 Laurence Liew, director of AI innovation at AI Singapore, a national AI programme launched by the National Research Foundation Singapore, said AI will continue to be a rapidly growing field with a wide range of potential applications such as in education, construction, healthcare and finance.
 “Other parties along the value chain will also enjoy the growth of this sector including data centre providers, cloud providers, and hardware vendors like Nvidia, Intel and AMD,” he said.
 But Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer and Internet at Aletheia Capital, warned that investors who want to bet on this space should watch out for share price volatility arising from events such as the US debt ceiling debate and avoid getting over-excited about the recent rally in stock prices.

552228,StarBiz,12,02/06/2023,AI tech rally masks ‘violent rotations’,Fear of missing out a cause for concern in options market,"NEW YORK: A handful of megacap technology stocks have propped up equity markets for the past several weeks as hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) lures in sidelined investors.
 But the fear of missing out on the rally is becoming cause for concern in the options market, says RBC Capital Markets’ head of derivatives strategy Amy Wu Silverman.
 The Nasdaq 100 index is up about 30% this year thanks to heavier weights in seven stocks: Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Tesla Inc and Nvidia Corp –the sole chipmaker in the group which is nearing US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion) in market capitalisation. 
 When benchmark moves are driven by only a handful of stocks, “it messes with how you look at correlation in the markets and thereby it messes with what options seem to tell you,” Silverman said on Bloomberg Television. 
 “It seems to tell you that things are resilient when the reality is there can be very violent rotations under the surface that is masked because of the narrowness of breadth in the market right now.”
 Silverman says the rush to tech has driven demand for call options higher than that for bearish puts as investors increasingly use derivatives as a way to place big bets on tech. That demand has lifted the cost of bullish options related to the Nasdaq 100, along with expected volatility. 
 “This is the exact phenomenon that we saw in GameStop, that we saw in AMC, that we saw in Salesforce,” Silverman said. 
 “And when that happens, you can get such outsized moves that it also forces other people who are underallocated to pay attention.”
 Silverman says markets are pricing in “a little bit more relief” due to a potential debt ceiling resolution, and that’s been reflected by a subdued readings on Wall Street’s fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index or VIX, but the liquidity drain as a result of a debt deal could cause a “regime shift” in volatility. 
 “What’s happening real time is most folks are actually rolling off some hedges they had on. But that doesn’t speak to what I think would be a longer term concern – when you see liquidity being pulled out of the market in force.” — Bloomberg",york handful megacap technology stock equity market week artificial intelligence lure investor rally concern option market capital market derivative strategy silverman heavier weight stock apple corp alphabet amazon meta platform corp sole chipmaker market capitalisation benchmark move handful stock correlation market option silverman television resilient reality violent rotation masked narrowness breadth market silverman rush tech demand call option bearish investor bet tech demand cost bullish option volatility exact phenomenon gamestop amc salesforce silverman move force people underallocated pay attention silverman market bit relief potential debt ceiling resolution reading street fear gauge chicago board option volatility vix liquidity drain result debt deal regime shift volatility real time folk hedge term concern liquidity market force bloomberg,"[(6, 0.9921793)]",6
552282,Main,26,02/06/2023,Code of conduct on AI soon,"EU, US feel ‘fierce urgency’ needed to curb potential risks","Stockholm: The European Union and the United States said Wednesday that they would soon release a voluntary code of conduct on artificial intelligence, hoping to develop common standards among democracies as China makes rapid gains.
 Both political and technology industry leaders have been warning of the growing risks as AI takes off, with potentially wide-ranging effects on privacy and other civil liberties.
 After talks with EU officials in Sweden, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Western partners felt the “fierce urgency” to act and would ask “like-minded countries” to join the voluntary code of conduct.
 “There’s almost always a gap when new technologies emerge,” Blinken said, with “the time it takes for governments and institutions to figure out how to legislate or regulate”.
 European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager added that a draft would be put forward “within weeks”.
 “We think it’s really important that citizens can see that democracies can deliver,” she said.
 She voiced hope “to do that in the broadest possible circle – with our friends in Canada, in the UK, in Japan, in India, bringing as many onboard as possible”.
 Sam Altman, whose firm OpenAI created the popular ChatGPT bot, took part in the talks of the Trade and Technology Council between the EU and the United States, hosted this year in the northern Swedish city of Lulea.
 The forum was set up in 2021 to try to ease trade frictions after the turbulent US presidency of Donald Trump but has since set its sights largely on artificial intelligence.
 In a joint statement released by the White House and the European Commission, the two sides called AI a “transformative technology with great promise for our people, offering opportunities to increase prosperity and equity”.
 “But in order to seize the opportunities it presents, we must mitigate its risks,” it said.
 It said experts from the two sides would work on “cooperation on AI standards and tools for trustworthy AI and risk management”.
 They also discussed how to work together on sixth-generation mobile technology, an area in which Europeans have taken an early lead. — AFP",stockholm european union wednesday release voluntary code conduct artificial intelligence common standard democracy rapid gain political technology industry leader risk wide effect civil liberty talk official secretary antony western partner urgency country voluntary code conduct gap technology blinken time government institution legislate regulate european commission vice president margrethe vestager draft week democracy hope broadest circle canada japan india onboard sam altman firm popular chatgpt bot talk technology council hosted northern swedish city lulea forum ease trade friction turbulent presidency donald trump sight artificial intelligence joint statement white house european commission transformative technology promise people opportunity prosperity equity seize opportunity risk expert cooperation standard tool trustworthy risk management sixth generation technology european afp,"[(3, 0.99202293)]",3
552334,Main,32,02/06/2023,AI can help tennis players block death threats and other social media hate,,"FRANCES Tiafoe says he receives death threats via social media after he loses professional tennis matches. Jessica Pegula says the same. So does Donna Vekic – directed at just her or her family, too.
 “Everybody gets them after a loss,” said Tiafoe, a 25-year-old from Maryland who was scheduled to play in the French Open’s second round yesterday and was a semi-finalist at last year’s US Open.
  “It’s just how society is today. I know how that affects people’s mental health. That’s very real.”
 Sloane Stephens, the 2017 champion at Flushing Meadows and 2018 runner-up at Roland Garros, says she often deals with racist messages directed at her online, and said some prompted the FBI to investigate.
 “It’s obviously been a problem my entire career. It has never stopped,” said Stephens, who is black. 
 “If anything, it’s only gotten worse.”
 In a bid to try to protect athletes from that sort of abuse at Roland Garros during the 15-day Grand Slam tournament that ends June 11, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) are paying a company to provide players with software that uses artificial intelligence to block these sorts of negative comments.
 Every contestant in every category – singles, doubles, juniors, wheelchair competitors and so on, for a total of around 700 to 800 – is allowed free access to Bodyguard.ai for use on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. A few dozen players had signed up for the service as of the start of this week, according to Bodyguard.“This is really important for us: for the players to be very comfortable and be able to focus on the competition. Tennis is mental. It’s really what you have in your mind that counts; you’re making 1,000 decisions during a match,” said FFT CEO Caroline Flaissier, who put the cost to the federation at somewhere between US$30,000 (RM138,000) and US$50,000 (RM231,000).
 “We know that there is a lot of cyberbullying,” she said. 
 “We have to address that major issue, so we thought let’s do a test.”
 That includes monitoring social media used by the FFT and the French Open itself. An FFT spokeswoman said on Wednesday that 4,500 messages had been deleted out of the 79,000 received on those accounts since May 21.
 Yann Guerin, head of sports for Nice-based Bodyguard, said the company’s software – which is constantly updated by employees who might notice new words or emojis that should be part of the screening – needs less than 100 milliseconds to analyse a comment and delete it if it’s “hateful or undesirable.” 
  He cited the example of one player who participated in qualifying rounds last week, before the start of the tournament proper.
 “He lost ... so he was disappointed. Then he checked his phone and was like, ‘Whoa,’” Guerin said, estimating that more than 70% of the comments that athlete received would fall under the heading of “toxicity.” — AP",france death threat social medium professional tennis match pegula donna vekic family loss tiafoe maryland play french round yesterday finalist society people health real sloane stephen champion meadow runner garros deal message online fbi investigate entire career stephen black worse bid protect sort abuse roland garros day grand slam tournament june french tennis federation fft company provide player software artificial intelligence block sort negative comment contestant category single junior wheelchair competitor allowed free access bodyguard twitter instagram facebook dozen player start week bodyguard player comfortable focus competition tennis mental mind decision fft ceo caroline flaissier cost federation lot address major issue test social medium fft french fft spokeswoman wednesday message received account guerin head sport bodyguard company software employee millisecond analyse comment delete hateful undesirable player round week tournament proper disappointed phone whoa guerin comment athlete fall toxicity,"[(4, 0.99337196)]",4
551770,Lifestyle,16,01/06/2023,Revolutionising education with AI,,"RAPID advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed multiple industries, and education is no exception. AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, have the potential to greatly enhance the learning experience for  students and provide valuable support  for educators.
 One of the most significant benefits of using AI in education is personalised learning. ChatGPT, a large language model, has the potential to revolutionise this aspect of education by offering individualised support to students. 
 By analysing the learning needs, interests and pace of each student, AI-driven platforms such as ChatGPT or any other customised instructional chatbots can  provide customised content, learning resources and feedback. This personalised approach allows students to learn at their own speed and develop a deeper understanding of subjects. 
 AI can assist educators by automating repetitive tasks such as grading assignments, quizzes and examinations. 
 By leveraging AI algorithms, ChatGPT can evaluate students’ work and offer instant, detailed feedback, freeing up  valuable time for educators to focus on more critical aspects of their role, such as lesson planning and student mentoring. 
 Another compelling aspect of AI in teaching is the facilitation of collaborative learning. AI-based teaching and learning platforms can be used as virtual teaching assistants, enabling students to engage  in group discussions, brainstorming  sessions, and collaborative problem- solving activities. 
 AI-driven platforms can guide these interactions by offering insights, suggesting resources, and moderating discussions, thereby fostering a dynamic and engaging learning environment. 
 Incorporating AI in assessment methods presents numerous possibilities for enhancing the evaluation process. Traditional assessments often focus on a limited range of skills and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of a student’s abilities. With AI, educators can create more diverse and dynamic assessments that evaluate students’ critical thinking, problem-solving and creativity. 
 ChatGPT, for example, can be utilised to generate customised questions, simulate real-world scenarios or provide real-time feedback on performance, enabling a more accurate and holistic assessment of students’ capabilities. 
 In addition to teaching and learning, AI can also play a crucial role in educational administration. 
 For instance, OUM is currently developing an AI-driven system that utilises machine learning to identify new learners at risk of dropping out. By doing so,  the university can provide targeted  counselling and support, ultimately improving retention rates.
 Despite the benefits, there are challenges and ethical considerations in adopting AI in teaching and assessment. Concerns surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to replace human educators must be addressed as the technology continues to evolve. 
 Establishing guidelines, maintaining transparency, and close collaboration among stakeholders, especially educators and policymakers, will be crucial in ensuring that AI is employed responsibly and ethically in the education sector. 
 Furthermore, with the emergence of ChatGPT, it is essential for educators to explore innovative assessment models to better evaluate student learning.
 AI-powered tools like ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionise teaching and assessment by offering personalised learning experiences, automating administrative tasks, and enabling more comprehensive evaluation of students’ skills. 
 Embracing these innovations, while navigating the ethical considerations, promises to create a more efficient, engaging, and effective educational landscape for future generations. 
 The future of higher education will involve a close collaboration between humans and AI-based educational tools. In fact, the role of human instructors can be distributed between the human instructors and the AI-driven platforms. 
 In the future, instruction could be the product of both human instructors and AI-based educational tools, with each playing a complementary role. For example, a human instructor can produce learning content while AI–based platforms provide continuous support to students. 
 This synergy and relationship between both would allow the human instructor to stop carrying out repetitive mechanical tasks as these can be performed by AI-powered educational tools. This will enable the instructor to devote time to high cognitive level tasks which are more creative instead.
 We are further exploring AI capabilities at Open University Malaysia (OUM), which is a digital university providing flexible part-time studies through online learning for working adults. An AI-powered chatbot, developed in-house by OUM for a Java programming course, was recently linked with ChatGPT for enhanced user experience, personalised learning, and real-time assistance. 
 The early version of the chatbot was honoured with a merit award at the prestigious MSC Malaysia APICTA 2019 Awards ceremony.
 The selection of programmes is abundant at OUM, with 55 programmes under four faculties – education; business and management; technology and applied sciences; and social sciences and humanities. 
 Earlier this year, the university was awarded the full five stars in the online learning category by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), the world’s most influential and credible ratings for universities globally. 
 Previously, the university had won gold at the Putra Aria Brand Awards 2022 in the education and learning category. The award was presented to OUM by the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia for being one of the most recognisable education brands for Malaysians.

551828,StarBiz,14,01/06/2023,Cathie Wood forecasts software stocks as next AI bet after Nvidia,,"NEW YORK: Cathie Wood says software providers will be the next to ride on the artificial intelligence frenzy driven by Nvidia Corp.
 “We are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it,” Wood, chief executive officer and founder of Ark Investment Management LLC, told Bloomberg TV.
 While Nvidia is expected to do well over time, Ark is “onto the next thing”, she added.
 Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF cut its holding in Nvidia in January and has missed out on an epic rally that made the chipmaker briefly cross US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion) in market valuation.
 Wood has defended her decision to dump Nvidia stocks, citing concerns over the computer chip industry’s boom-bust cycle and said it was “priced ahead of the curve” in a tweet earlier this week.
 Instead, Wood is betting on software stocks that she expects to eventually grow into the size of Nvidia, citing UiPath Inc, Twilio Inc and Teladoc Health Inc as key examples. Wood’s funds hold all three stocks.
 “For every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers and SaaS providers will generate US$8 (RM36.94) in revenue,” Wood told Bloomberg TV.
 Wood is betting on a trio of companies that have fallen far off their highs.
 New York-based UiPath rose to more than US$85 (392.44) a share after going public in 2021 and has tumbled about 80% since.
 San Francisco-based Twilio has dropped 85% from its peak in 2021, while Teladoc Health is off more than 90% from its high the same year.
 Ark Innovation ETF has lost more than 10% since its peak in early February, while the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index has jumped 12% over the period.
 Wood reiterated that Tesla is the “biggest artificial intelligence play” and expected its stock price to reach US$2,000 (RM9,234) in 2027 on autonomous technology from around US$200 (RM923) currently.
 “Autonomous taxi platforms, we believe globally, will deliver US$10 trillion (RM46.2 trillion) in revenue from almost zero by 2038,” she said on Bloomberg TV.
 “Tesla, many people think, is an auto stock. We don’t. We think it’s much more than that.”

551546,StarBiz,9,31/05/2023,AI likely to unlock big opportunities  in Indonesia,,"JAKARTA: Most artificial intelligence (AI) development is happening elsewhere for now, but investors in Indonesia and abroad are ready to pounce on the cutting-edge technology it promises to unlock in South-East Asia’s largest economy.
 The country’s macroeconomic trends, coupled with a relatively young and increasingly tech-savvy population, are seen as creating endless opportunities for homegrown startups to adopt as well as advance AI.
 The use of AI is growing each day, and, according to a study conducted by US-based management consulting firm Kearney, AI could contribute US$1 trillion (RM4.6 trillion) to the Asean economy by 2030.
 Local and regional venture capital firms (VCs) interviewed by The Jakarta Post are enthusiastic about AI supercharging business activity in Indonesia.
 “With the right business model and products, AI solutions can definitely be good investment opportunities,” said Edward Ismawan Chamdani, managing partner at VC outfits Gayo Capital and Ideosource. “There will definitely be money coming in from AI projects.”
 He added that, while the world’s largest tech companies had been created during downturns, as new problems and inefficiencies became more apparent, “investors will always see the potential market size and whether the pie is big enough to support the growth story”.
 Livinglab Ventures vice-president of investment Edmund Carulli said: “It makes sense to invest and try out new technology such as AI in Indonesia. The upside will still be far above the risk of failing.”
 Openspace vice-president Tania Lestari concurred: “AI has been one of the key themes we identified as a space with huge growth potential in the next few years.”
 Openspace has invested in Datature, a Singapore-based no-code end-to-end machine learning operations platform, which it believes addresses a big pain point of scarce and expensive AI talent at smaller enterprises or traditional enterprises new to AI development.

551558,StarBiz,11,31/05/2023,Arm chief pitches  chip designer  as AI play  in IPO build-up,,"LONDON: Semiconductor designer Arm Ltd has found its calling card for the rest of the year as it builds towards a much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO): artificial intelligence (AI).
 Arm technology is enabling many AI applications already taken for granted, and it will be fundamental to building the next wave of AI innovations, chief executive officer Rene Haas said in a keynote address at the Computex trade show in Taiwan.
 AI has swept across the global tech industry this year, juicing stock prices and propelling Nvidia Corp to the brink of becoming the first trillion-dollar chipmaker.
 Arm, in search of a lofty valuation to satisfy parent SoftBank Group Corp (SBG), is looking to present itself as another avenue for investors to tap into this vein of tech optimism.
 “Given the chase for AI stocks, we think SBG may like to present Arm as an AI play, although most of its current business is based on designing and licensing semiconductor intellectual property, particularly for mobile devices,” said Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal.
 Citing examples from Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa voice assistant and Alphabet Inc’s Google Pixel phones to smart traffic light management and robotic beehive maintenance, Haas made the argument that on-device and small-scale AI processors will all run Arm technology.
 He also pointed to Nvidia’s Grace Hopper next-generation architecture for accelerating AI as another example of Arm technology in the AI supply chain.
 It was the one future product that Haas could talk about, he said, since Nvidia had just discussed it a day prior. Haas was otherwise tight-lipped about Arm deployments to come due to his company’s quiet period ahead of an IPO.

 The shares rose as much as 6% before trimming as chief executive officer Robin Li was cited as saying that the model will be used to upgrade its search engine. Other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, including SenseTime Group Inc and Meitu Inc, gained at least 3% each.
 Baidu shares have had a rough ride this year as a rally driven by the hype ahead of Ernie’s demo launch in March faltered on disappointment. 
 The latest development, if successful, could add impetus to the shares and help the firm ride on a renewed global AI frenzy after Nvidia Corp’s surprisingly strong revenue forecast.  
 “Investors have been waiting for an update on Ernie Bot. Also the AI frenzy has spread to China markets yesterday after Nvidia’s good results,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian. 
 Hong Kong markets were closed last Friday. 
 Even with yesterday’s gains, Baidu shares are down more than 25% from a February high as its chatbot, China’s first answer to ChatGPT, failed to match high expectations. 
 The Chinese Internet giant debuted Ernie Bot through several pre-recorded videos in March, defying expectations for a real-time demo, and later delayed a press briefing planned to showcase how the chatbot will be integrated into cloud computing service. 
 Investors have also questioned Baidu’s ability to launch a Chinese language AI model. A Baidu spokesperson declined to comment further when contacted by Bloomberg yesterday.

550800,Main,15,29/05/2023,AI learning how to push our buttons,Ressa: Releasing it into the wild ‘like open-sourcing the Manhattan Project’,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is magnifying exponentially the fear, anger and hate that social media has already weaponised, journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa (pic) has warned.
 “If the first generative AI was (about) fear, anger and hate – weaponising those – this one now leads to weaponising intimacy,” Ressa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov for standing up to authoritarian regimes, told The Straits Times.
 Ressa, who founded the Philippine online news site Rappler, was in Singapore this weekend for the New.Now.Next Media Conference organised by the Asia chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association.
 It was hosted at Google’s Singapore office from Thursday to Saturday.
 She said the first iteration of AI – seen in machine-learning programmes – was meant to get users addicted to scrolling through social media, so that companies such as Facebook and Twitter could make more money from targeted ads and harvested data.
 But what these programmes learnt was that lies “spread six times faster than really boring facts”, she said, adding that the algorithms that power social media platforms keep churning out lies.
 “What that does to you is that... it pumps you with toxic sludge – fear, anger, hate – and when you tell a lie a million times, it becomes a fact,” Ressa said.
 This, she said, has helped populist and autocratic leaders rise to power.
 Ressa and Rappler had been in the crosshairs of a strongman,  Rodrigo Duterte, who was elected President of the Philippines in 2016. He was aided by a massive social media campaign that pushed his populist platform, anchored by anti-crime rhetoric.
 She is currently facing civil and criminal cases lodged by the Justice Ministry and regulators under Duterte that she sees as retaliation by the former president for Rappler’s critical coverage of his brutal war on the narcotics trade.
 His anti-drug crusade led to over 20,000 suspects killed in police raids or by unnamed vigilantes.
 Ressa added that the impact goes beyond politics, citing a report issued by United States Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy last Tuesday that showed growing evidence that social media use may seriously harm children.
 Dr Murthy said while social media can help children and adolescents find a community to connect with, it also contains “extreme, inappropriate, and harmful content” that can “normalise” self-harm and suicide.
 Ressa said the new generation of AI – chatbots like ChatGPT created by Microsoft-funded OpenAI and Google’s Bard – would be spreading lies even faster, more broadly and more intimately if they are “released into the wild” without guardrails.
 “It’s like open-sourcing the Manhattan Project,” she said, referring to research that led to the development of the atom bomb.
 Wrongly used, she warned, AI would allow “bad actors” to stoke more online hate and violence that could spill over to the real world, prettify the resumes of despots, and serve up even more “micro-targeted”, invasive ads.
 She said even those responsible for coding these chatbots warn that there is a “10% or greater chance that this leads to an extinction-level event, not hitting another species, but humanity”.
 “It’s like releasing something as dangerous as nuclear fission into the hands of people with no guardrails,” she said.
 Ressa said OpenAI’s own chief executive Sam Altman has told US lawmakers about how dangerous AI can be.
 “But no one asked him, ‘If it’s so dangerous, why are you releasing it?,’” she said.
 Microsoft’s chief economist Michael Schwarz has warned of the potential risk of “bad actors” causing “real damage” making use of AI.
 “I’m quite confident that, yes, AI will be used by bad actors, and, yes, it will cause real damage,” he said at an event hosted by the Word Economic Forum on May 3.
 “We have to put safeguards” to prevent hucksters and tyrants from profiting off AI with money-making scams and vote rigging, he said.
 Ressa said AI, as it is shaping up to be, has to be reined in, along with the rest of the technology sector, which she described as the “least regulated industry in the world”.
 “The problem with a godlike tech is that it is being used for profit – and that’s what we need to stop. This is where governments need to come in and protect their citizens,” she said. — The Straits Times/ANN",artificial intelligence fear anger social medium journalist nobel laureate maria pic generative fear anger hate lead intimacy peace prize russian journalist dmitry muratov authoritarian regime strait time founded philippine online news site rappler singapore weekend medium conference asia chapter asian american journalist association google singapore office thursday saturday iteration machine programme meant user social medium company twitter money ad data programme learnt lie time algorithm power social medium platform lie pump sludge fear anger hate lie time autocratic leader power ressa rappler crosshairs strongman duterte president philippine massive social medium campaign populist platform anti crime rhetoric civil criminal justice ministry regulator retaliation president critical coverage brutal war narcotic trade drug crusade suspect police raid unnamed vigilante impact politics report united surgeon vivek murthy tuesday evidence social medium harm child murthy social medium child adolescent community extreme inappropriate harmful content normalise harm suicide ressa generation chatbots openai google bard lie wild guardrail manhattan project development atom bomb bad actor online hate violence spill real prettify resume micro invasive ad responsible chatbots chance extinction level event specie humanity dangerous nuclear fission hand people guardrail openai chief executive sam altman lawmaker dangerous dangerous microsoft chief economist michael schwarz potential risk bad actor real damage confident bad actor real damage event word economic forum safeguard huckster tyrant money scam ressa rest technology sector industry godlike tech profit government citizen strait time,"[(2, 0.25760743), (5, 0.7390643)]",5
551028,StarBiz,10,29/05/2023,UBS: Fake AI content feeding market disruptions,,"NEW YORK: The spread of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be “highly disruptive” to financial markets as the technology aids the publication of false information, and makes leaks of intellectual property more likely, according to analysts at UBS Group AG.
 In an environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing op-ed published Friday, UBS analysts Annabel Willder, Victoria Kalb and Julie Hudson listed all the ways in which the increasing adoption of generative AI might results in a number of ethical issues.
 “Inaccurate information or ‘confabulations’ generated by AI models and that relate to regulators, companies or public figures could be widely shared, with potential market implications,” the analysts wrote.
 Such examples are already starting to appear. 
 Earlier this week, US stocks briefly declined after a falsified photograph of an explosion near the Pentagon went viral across social media platforms. 
 The event stands out as what appears to be the first major instance of an AI-generated image moving markets and comes just months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, setting off a global race to develop similar services.
 In light of such risks, many banks have placed restrictions around the use of generative AI programmes. 
 Earlier this year, firms including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Wells Fargo & Co banned usage of the tool, with Bank of America telling employees that ChatGPT and openAI are prohibited from business use, Bloomberg reported in February. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has curbed its employees’ use of the ChatGPT chatbot.
 The spread of such technology is likely to make it harder to distinguish between reality and so-called deepfakes, according to the UBS analysts. 
 Risks include the publication of fake videos of chief executives issuing false corporate updates, or of well-known investors announcing adjustments to their holdings, all of which could impact markets, the analysts said. 
 “ESG considerations in light of the increasing adoption of generative AI are significant,” they wrote. 
 “Notably, we believe deepfake and inaccurate information could have significant market impacts if regulators, company representatives or other public figures are misrepresented.”
 At the same time, interest in AI has changed the fortunes of companies behind the technology. 
 Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is on track to reach a US$1 trillion (RM4.60 trillion) market value following an AI-fueled sales forecast, as investors pile into companies that provide components essential to the development and hosting of AI.

Here’s how that’s working out.","CHATBOTS have been around for decades, but the launch of new generation tools like ChatGPT and Bing was a game-changer.
 For those who haven’t tried them out yet, chatbots are basically superpowered search engines with added performance.
 If you have a question, a bot will search millions of documents and paste together various bits of them into one coherent answer. It does this in seconds.
 Chatbots can also correct grammar and punctuation. Additionally, they can rewrite information in various styles.
 For rescuers and animal lovers, chatbots offer a wonderful opportunity.Good posts help pets
 “Paws has over 200 cats, 250 dogs and two rabbits looking for a home,” Celine Chum from Paws Selangor points out. 
 “Writing adoption notices is a constant job, and sometimes your brain dries up. I’m interested in any tool that helps.”
 Shannon Lam, KL Pooch Resort & Rescue, Kalumpang, Selangor, agrees. 
 “Writing an engaging post can take 10 minutes, if I’m inspired and not distracted, but more often it takes longer,” she shares. “If there’s a tool, I’m interested!”
 There are general bots like ChatGPT and Bing. Additionally, PetFinder.my also launched PetGPT AI Writer. It’s based on OpenAI ChatGPT technology but has been tweaked to help rescuers and shelters craft creative, engaging pet adoption posts.
 “A good adoption post helps pets,” Andy Koh, co-founder and CEO of PetFinder.my, points out. 
 “But putting that together isn’t easy.
 “We are lucky because a team of five international artificial intelligence experts volunteered to help. They’re hot on improving animal welfare, and so they contributed their data skills.”
 Working together, they spent two months on the project.
 “In the past, we analysed 20,000 posts for a contest,” Koh explains. “We used that as a base and sorted information according to sentiment, keywords and overall tone. We put together rules for styles and introduced a random element.”
 Each person who uses the tool gets different sentences but with some similar keywords.
 “It’s experimental,” Koh says. “We don’t know yet how effective it will be. It’s a first step.”How it works 
 Users register on PetFinder.my and click through to PetGPT. Typing into the box, write a minimum of 100 characters, that’s two or three sentences, about the pet’s name, looks, character and needs. Then select for tone, style and perspective.
 The writer can write in nine different tones: affectionate, witty, hopeful, compassionate, funny, sarcastic, sad, desperate or ecstatic. It also offers six styles: descriptive, persuasive, academic, fantasy, poem, or Q&A. You can write as the pet or the human. Finally, there’s a standard 300-word option or a compact 80-word option.
 Although English is recommended, it also works in BM and Mandarin.
 First-hand experience
 Lam shared details of Hazel, a tan female dog with a friendly, energetic attitude looking for a home with a garden. (read story below)
 “For a small rescuer with one ad, the second one is great,” Lam observes. “It’s useful for generating ideas and different styles. And I think it would be helpful for people writing in a second language.
 “But the poetic one, which Malaysian will relate to that? You’d sound like a fruit loop. I don’t think that style is useful.
 “Overall, it’s interesting, but for shelters like ours that do multiple ads a week, it may be repetitive. I make an effort to make adoption notices unique.”
 Chum has tried and tested PetGPT and other services. 
 “They’re convenient,” she shares. “You just type in details and it does the job.
 “I’m getting the best results  by being very specific. Like, I’ll mention a dog really loves  a particular toy, or discuss a  cute habit that a cat has. That helps make it different and stand out.”
 The future
 For now, chatbots are new. ChatGPT and Bing are free  for now, and PetGPT is fee-based.  
 “We have to pay a fee to OpenAI (co-founded by Elon Musk) for every word generated by their system,” Koh explains, “so there is considerable infrastructure cost.”
 “So far we have distributed over RM32,000 of PetGPT credits to rescuers. If they wish to create additional profiles, a small fee of RM0.99 applies, which helps subsidise our infrastructure costs.” 
 With thousands of pets waiting in shelters to be matched with a home, all tools are useful. For now, if you’re struggling with writing posts, AI chatbots are definitely worth a look.

549250,Main,28,25/05/2023,Filmmakers at Cannes grapple with ‘tectonic’ AI shift,,"Cannes: At an artificial intelligence (AI) talk on a Cannes beach, a presenter’s voice is cloned and used to say a random phrase in three languages, while another’s face is replaced live on screen as they speak.
 Few of the film buffs attending the premiere industry festival are shocked.
 Ever since the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT took the world by storm six months ago, spurring an AI race among tech giants, the technology has shaken up the film industry.
 The use of AI to write scripts is one of the leading concerns among Hollywood movie and TV writers who are in their third week of a strike that has upended productions.
 But the technology is revolutionising everything from voice acting, to analysing scripts and coming up with a budget, to creating mock-ups of scenes before you even pick up a camera.
 “New things are created every single day,” says Quinn Halleck, a 25-year-old filmmaker who is about to release a three-part short movie called ./ Sigma_001 which is about a sentient AI being, and uses AI from conception to marketing and distribution.
 But while some assistant roles may disappear, he believes a human director remains essential.
 “You still have to come up with the ideas, you have to create the prompts and curate the answers.”
 The world’s leading film festival, taking place on the French Riviera, got a hefty dose of AI with a lengthy scene de-aging Harrison Ford, 80, in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.
 While filmmakers are brimming with excitement over the technology’s potential, questions of its abuse hang over the session.
 “This set of technologies represents, you know, a set of tectonic social shifts like the industrial revolution, which will play out over the next 20-50 years and people should be worried about what happens,” Graham says.
 “Unfortunately, I don’t believe that you can stop the advancement of the technology because a lot of it is open source. There’s not really anything to turn off.”

548450,StarBiz,4,24/05/2023,AI gold rush will take humanity to dark places,,"SCANNING humanity’s eyeballs in exchange for cryptocurrency and assigning the encoded results to a blockchain is the kind of dystopian idea that might have stoked a speculative boom during the pandemic, before eventually crashing to earth and leaving a trail of angry investors behind.
  But with interest in artificial intelligence (AI) reaching fever pitch, this risky solution to proving personhood in the digital world is gaining new impetus. 
 Worldcoin, backed by luminaries including Marc Andreessen and Sam Bankman-Fried, began as a way to create a valuable token by giving it away to people willing to identify themselves via their biometric data. 
 What the project euphemistically dubs its “field test” phase involved scanning half a million irises using a chrome sphere dubbed “the orb” – prompting myriad accounts of exploitation, invasion of privacy, deception and attempted fraud. The story might have ended there.
 But as crypto winter gives way to a scorching AI summer for tech fundraising, the project is aiming for a new lease on life more aligned with the vision of another Sam – Altman, co-founder of Worldcoin parent organisation “Tools for Humanity.” 
 Those iris scans, converted into unique identifiers, are the centrepiece of a plan to create a “World ID” that can distinguish between people and bots in a future dominated by AI.
 With Altman’s star riding high in the Silicon Valley firmament, the orb is embarking on a world tour accompanied by an app that offers crypto transactions. The Financial Times reports Worldcoin, valued at US$1bil (RM4.5bil)  is close to clinching US$100mil (RM457mil) in additional funding.The full force of tech’s saviour complex is on display here, and regulators and citizens alike need to keep their collective guard up. You don’t have to be a Davos-attending globalist to see the benefits of an Internet with fewer bots and more confirmed humans. 
 But one also doesn’t have to be a hoodie-wearing bitcoiner or privacy activist to see the risks. 
 Even if it can’t be traced back to its originator, an iris scan is sensitive data and handing it over should require informed consent about where it will end up. 
 The Worldcoin Foundation is based offshore in the regulation-lite jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands, its digital-token allocation process is opaque, and its database of 1.7 million iris-originated codes requires faith in the accuracy of its underlying information. 
 Why should anyone value this as a trustworthy digital turnstile for everything from financial services to universal basic income?
 In the same way as techno-solutionists offer AI companions as the answer to loneliness wrought by social media, this proposed fix to the side-effects of AI tools including ChatGPT, the generative software unleashed on the world by Altman’s OpenAI company, threatens to create even more unintended consequences. 
 Already, TechCrunch has reported that hackers have stolen the credentials of several of its elite orb “operators” – essentially recruiters who earn money for every sign-up – even if Worldcoin says no personal user data was accessed. 
 Worldcoin has also confirmed reports that hundreds of iris codes have flooded the dark web, changing hands for cash in territories including China where the startup doesn’t operate. 
 If the best  technology is indistinguishable from magic, the effectiveness of World ID as the best way of defeating malicious bots looks more like an optical illusion.
 Tiago Sada, head of product for Worldcoin, tells me that there has been less consumer resistance than expected to the project, but concedes that the pitch is complicated and “different people like different parts.”He says that today one could make the case that the Worldcoin app is helping humanity by offering crypto transfers, and that in future adding a digital ID could help some countries access financial services.
 Bad press and bad vibes are unlikely to deter Worldcoin’s backers amid an AI gold rush. Another Altman-backed startup, Humane, recently raised US$100mil (RM457mil) despite having neither product nor profit – it says it’s collaborating with OpenAI and will partner with Microsoft Corp’s cloud services. 
 Imagine Worldcoin one day being part of this network, with orbs that are smaller and more ubiquitous than they are today and iris-code checks serving as the Captcha checkers of the AI era and maybe even enhancing OpenAI’s value. 
 The revenue model might involve charging fees for authentication, no doubt inflating the value of Worldcoin tokens for early holders. Not exactly humane for most of us, but aligned with Palo Alto’s worldview of improving humanity through utilitarian, data-driven experiments – even if academic Margie Cheesman calls Worldcoin a “scam-experiment.”
 What happens next will depend on the ability of those orb operators to keep people signing up, whether crypto bros get seduced by the wave of enthusiasm for all things AI-related – and how determined regulators become to lift the hood of Worldcoin. 
 When asked earlier this month when Worldcoin tokens would be distributed, Altman said Americans might “never” get any because of crypto regulation. 
 Clearly dismayed by the state of crypto in the United States, he said: “The Europeans are supposed to do this, but not us.” If the Europeans don’t flex their data-privacy muscles by taking a closer look at those orbs, the AI boom will take humanity to some pretty dark places. — BloombergLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering digital currencies, the European Union and France.

548410,StarBiz,12,24/05/2023,Intel shares details on AI chips and shifts strategy,,"NEW YORK: Intel Corp has provided a handful of new details on a chip for artificial intelligence (AI) computing it plans to introduce in 2025 as it shifts strategy to compete against Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
 At a supercomputing conference in Germany on Monday, Intel said its forthcoming “Falcon Shores” chip will have 288 gigabytes of memory and support 8-bit floating-point computation.
 Those technical specifications are important as artificial intelligence models similar to services like ChatGPT have exploded in size, and businesses are looking for more powerful chips to run them.
 The details are also among the first to trickle out as Intel carries out a strategy shift to catch up to Nvidia.
 Intel trails the market in chips for AI, and AMD, in which it is expected to challenge Nvidia’s position with a chip called the MI300.
 Intel, by contrast, has essentially no significant market share after its would-be Nvidia competitor, a chip called Ponte Vecchio, suffered years of delays.
 Intel on Monday said it has nearly completed shipments for Argonne National Lab’s Aurora supercomputer based on Ponte Vecchio, which Intel claims has better performance than Nvidia’s latest AI chip, the H100.
 But Intel’s Falcon Shores follow-on chip won’t be on the market until 2025 when Nvidia will likely have another chip of its own.
 Jeff McVeigh, corporate vice-president of Intel’s supercomputing group, said the company is taking time to rework the chip after giving up its prior strategy of combining graphics processing units (GPUs) with its central processing units (CPUs).
 “While we aspire to have the best CPU and the best GPU in the market, it was hard to say that one vendor at a time was going to have the best combination of those,” McVeigh told Reuters.
 “If you have discrete offerings, that allows you at the platform level to choose both between the ratio and the vendors.” — Reuters",york intel corp handful detail chip artificial intelligence plan shift strategy corp micro device conference germany monday intel falcon shore chip memory support bit computation technical specification artificial intelligence model service exploded size business powerful chip detail intel strategy shift nvidia intel trail market chip challenge nvidia position chip intel contrast market share nvidia competitor chip ponte vecchio delay intel shipment argonne national lab aurora supercomputer ponte intel claim performance nvidia chip intel falcon shore chip market chip jeff mcveigh corporate vice president intel company time rework chip prior strategy graphic unit gpus central unit aspire cpu gpu market hard vendor time combination mcveigh reuters discrete offering level ratio vendor reuters,"[(0, 0.99204)]",0
547966,Lifestyle,14,23/05/2023,‘Architects don’t need AI’,Renowned British architect says artificial intelligence can’t copy the physicality of the world we live in.,"BRITISH architect Norman Foster has spent six decades pushing the boundaries of technology with awe-inspiring modernist structures from California to Hong Kong, but he is yet to be convinced by the craze for artificial intelligence.
 “Artificial intelligence at the moment has the ability to cheat, to invent,” he said in a recent interview in Paris, which is hosting a retrospective of his work.
 “We live in a world which is physical, we inhabit buildings, streets, squares. That physicality, you can’t replicate by artificial intelligence.”
 Foster has been shaping urban landscapes since the 1960s and won the Pritzker Prize, the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in architecture, in 1999.
 His statement projects include Apple’s giant ring-shaped headquarters in California, London’s Wembley Stadium and Millennium Bridge, and Berlin’s Reichstag.
 Experts describe his practice, Foster and Partners, as possibly the most prolific in history, and the most adept at navigating changing trends and technologies.
 “He conceives architecture almost as an organism balancing itself with the air, the sun, life,” said Frederic Migayrou, curator of the Norman Foster exhibition at the Pompidou Centre in the French capital.
 Yet he has not swerved controversy, irking climate campaigners with his keenness to build airports and his views on the environment.
 Hard facts
 He is a champion of urban living – “people live longer in cities” – but his vision for sustaining urban lifestyles has courted some criticism.
 He supports nuclear power, saying it had not caused a single death and the world would only be able to tackle climate change “with hard facts, not emotion”. 
 He sees it as a vital part of the solution to the deprivation and poverty seen in megacities and overpopulated slums across the world.
 “Many people gravitated to those cities because there are more opportunities,” he said. “The answer has to be an abundance of clean energy, and the cleanest, safest form of energy is nuclear.”
 Hong Kong’s Chek Lap Kok airport, opened in 1998, made a huge splash for his firm, and he has worked on several airports since – much to the annoyance of climate activists, who see air travel as part of the problem.
 Yet when he talks of his broader philosophy, the 87-year-old could easily make common cause with climate activists.
 End of the sprawl
 Surrounded by models of his greatest creations, he talked breezily about the development of cleaner, greener cities.
 The pandemic accelerated a growing need for people to have access to outdoor spaces for eating and strolling, and for services within walking distance of their homes, he argued.
 “The cities which are most popular... they fit that model, essentially it’s a European model born before the ascendency of the automobile,” he said.
 And the transformation of our relationship with cars is central to the reshaping of modern cities, he said.
 “You have younger generations who are less interested in ownership, who will move towards ride-sharing and mobility more as a service,” he said. 
 This was pushing us away from sprawling car-centric cities with rigid work-home zones to ones where buildings were multipurpose, reducing the need for commuting.
 Despite his storied history, Foster, still a central figure in all these threads of modern design, is not keen to dwell on his achievements.
 The Pompidou exhibition, which displays models of his buildings alongside exhibits that inspired their design, has allowed him to see hidden connections.
 But understandably for someone who forged the “high-tech” architectural movement in the 1960s with fellow Briton Richard Rogers, what comes next is always more important than what has already gone.

547540,StarBiz,9,22/05/2023,AI expected to ease firms’ digital data burden,Faster pace of work a hindrance to innovation,"HANOI: Businesses are all carrying digital debt.
 The volume of data, emails and chats has outpaced their ability to process it all, according to the 2023 Work Trend Index report: “Will AI Fix Work?” newly released by Microsoft.
 The 2023 Work Trend Index surveyed 31,000 people across industries in 31 countries, including Vietnam as well as trillions of signals from emails, meetings and chats across Microsoft 365, plus labour trends on LinkedIn.
 The data showed that the pace of work has accelerated faster than humans can keep up, and it’s impacting innovation.
 The report showed that every minute spent on managing this digital debt is a minute not spent on creative work.
 Specifically, 76% of respondents in Vietnam said they don’t have enough time and energy to get things done – this rate is 64% globally.
 They are 6.6 times more likely to struggle with innovation and strategic thinking.
 Meanwhile, 65% of Vietnamese leaders expressed concerns about the lack of creativity and innovation at work – compared to 60% globally.
 Only 63% of Vietnamese workers consider their presence in meetings necessary – almost twice the global rate (35%).
 In particular, 79% of Vietnamese workers agreed that they cannot maintain concentration throughout the working day.
 According to Microsoft 365 usage statistics, the average person spends 57% of their time communicating and only 43% of their time on creative works.
 The leading cause of productivity loss is ineffective meetings.
 The Authority of Information Technology Application under the Information and Communications Ministry believed that digital data and customers have become the two most valuable assets of businesses in the digital transformation era.
 The competition in the digital transformation era is no longer about prices, but intelligence through deep understanding of customer data.
 With a large volume of digital data, it is not easy to exploit and understand that data.
 Therefore, data processing plays a key role in the overall operation of enterprises.
 In order to turn data into the keys to a breakthrough, every employee needs to have the skills to grasp the right tools and software to effectively exploit, filter, analyse, store and present data.
 In which, artificial intelligence (AI) creates a completely new way of working, not only a tool, but has become a virtual assistant that liberates workers from the burden of huge digital data and promotes creative innovation.
 As the work landscape has changed with AI development, people need to change too.
 The most important thing for every leader is how to take advantage of AI to reduce workload, promote creativity and build employees’ ability to use AI, the report said.
 In this context, the next-generation AI is expected to lift the weight of work. 
 Organisations that move first to embrace AI will break the cycle – increasing creativity and productivity for everyone, it added.
 While 54% of Vietnamese workers said they were worried that Al would replace their job position, up to 90% wanted to assign as much work as possible to Al to reduce the workload (this rate globally at 49% and 70% respectively). 
 Nine out of 10 Vietnamese workers feel comfortable using AI not only for administrative tasks (94%) but also for analytical work (94%) and even creative aspects in their work (91%).
 Affirming that the speed of work has increased faster than human ability and affecting innovation, Nguyen Quynh Tram, general director of Microsoft Vietnam, said that every employee needs to have the ability to use and create instructions for AI.

547194,StarEdu,3,21/05/2023,‘Use AI responsibly’,,"THE Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) has produced an advisory note on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, in higher education.
 Advisory Note no. 2/2023, said MQA deputy chief executive officer (Quality Assurance) Prof Khairul Salleh Mohamed Sahari, recommends prudent and responsible use of these tools by institutions, lecturers and students to enrich teaching and learning (PdP).
 “As the progression of generative AI is exponential, it is important to embrace and leverage this technology, and if used wisely and ethically, generative AI tools can facilitate effective learning for students,” he said in an email to StarEdu.
 Prof Khairul Salleh was responding to calls by experts for an open and considered approach when looking at the role of AI-powered tools in academia, as tertiary students praise its benefits (Time to outsmart plagiarism, The Star, April 12).
 The advisory note states that rapid development of digital technology with various open-access functions demands that public and private universities, polytechnics, community colleges, and all other higher education institutions (HEIs) and public training institutes accredited by the MQA, enhance their understanding of various aspects of the concept, and the potential and risks of this technology, to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of PdP activities.Generative AI uses machine learning models to create content based on user input. Its applications use algorithms to manipulate and synthesise data to create new text, image, music, voice, video and other forms of content, as if these were created by humans. 
 In PdP, these applications can help users obtain, search, explain and analyse online sources; curate information; generate answers and ideas to questions for classroom activities; and edit their work.
 While generative AI can increase competitiveness, creativity and innovation if used correctly and effectively, over-reliance and failure to monitor its use can be detrimental to the mastering of knowledge and skills like writing, summarising, evaluating, problem-solving, and critical thinking. What may also result are inaccuracies, which can compromise academic integrity.Academic staff and administrators in the higher education sector are beginning to use generative AI applications to detect materials generated by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), such as GPTZero, Writefull X GPT Detector, and DNG.AI ChatGPT Detector.Academic staff, as educators and facilitators in implementing flexible and personalised learning, can be supported by generative AI technology to provide a meaningful learning environment for students.
 They must, however, cultivate its use with integrity and be role models for students while ensuring that the latter are able to master learning outcomes with appropriate PdP and assessment approaches.
 The advisory note calls on education institutions to create clear guidelines for academic staff and students on the use of generative AI applications in teaching, research, and scientific writing to support the development of knowledge and competencies in line with the learning outcomes of the programmes.
 Institutions must also monitor and review policies, guidelines and practices related to the use of generative AI to ensure that academic quality and management frameworks are strengthened. 
 In addition, students must be guided on their use of generative AI through the provision of curation, fact-checking, decision-making, and critical thinking skills. While generative AI can be used to support learning, it cannot take over the tasks of a student.

547094,StarBiz 7,10,20/05/2023,AI alarmists dragging us down a rabbit hole,,"A funny thing happened during Sam Altman’s testimony before Congress earlier this week.
 Senator Richard Blumenthal said his “biggest nightmare” about artificial intelligence (AI) was the looming new industrial revolution and the displacement of millions of workers.
 When the OpenAI chief executive was asked about his biggest AI fear, he proposed something more vague and frightening: that it will “cause significant harm to the world”.
 Sam Altman has long believed that super-intelligent machines threaten the existence of humanity. Jobs, on the other hand, would get better, he said. The senators seemed to go along with this.   
 Fear of an AI apocalypse was once relegated to the realm of fringe theory; now it’s getting much more attention than it should.
 Multiple media reports recently conveyed the existential fears of Geoffrey “Godfather-of-AI” Hinton. In March, an open letter signed by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries called for a pause on AI research because of the risks to humanity.
 That month, warning that the result of building super-intelligent machines was that “literally everyone on Earth will die”.
 In reality, computer scientists tend to agree there is only a tiny chance that AI will wipe out humanity.
 But the idea has taken hold in mainstream discourse, thanks in part to Silicon Valley’s fixation on an ideology known as longtermism.
 First proposed by the Oxford philosopher Derrick Parfit in 1984 and popularized by William MacAskill’s 2022 book What We Owe the Future, it’s an ethical stance that prioritises humanity’s long-term future over the present, and has become a credo for tech billionaires.
 Musk, for instance, tweeted about MacAskill’s book, saying “this is a close match for my philosophy”.
 The idea appeals to technologists because of the way it quantifies moral dilemmas. If there are 7.8 billion people alive today, but 80 trillion lives that could be born in the future, we should technically prioritise those future lives.
 The same logic applies to AI. Even if there is only a fraction of a chance that intelligent machines extinguish humanity, that cost is so big that it’s essentially infinite.
 Multiply those tiny odds with an infinite cost and you get a problem that’s infinitely large.
 This kind of moral math has a special appeal to Silicon Valley’s detached engineer’s mindset, where problems are fixed through debugging code and a never-ending effort to “optimise” services through testing and evaluation.
 Unfortunately, acting on this ideology can also become self-serving. Wealthy technologists donate to causes aimed at saving our future selves from AI, but that money can end up flowing in a closed, almost incestuous circle.
 Musk and Peter Thiel donated to OpenAI in December 2015, back when it was a non-profit, because of its stated mission to build AI that would not destroy us.
 Open Philanthropy, the charitable vehicle of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, then gave US$30mil (RM137mil) to OpenAI in 2017, its largest donation that year, because of the “global catastrophic risk” of advanced AI.  
 Yet, two of OpenAI’s top researchers were advisers to Open Philanthropy, and lived in the same house as the charity’s executive director, who was also engaged to another OpenAI scientist.
 As for OpenAI itself, its mission of saving humanity got skewed by all the financial demands.
 The nonprofit couldn’t afford the vast computing power necessary to build an artificial superintelligence, so it became a for-profit company and entered a close partnership with Microsoft Corp.
 Microsoft now stands to profit from OpenAI’s research into saving humanity from AI.
 You can understand the initial appeal of longtermism. It seems like a wonderfully progressive alternative to our rather shallow preference of short-term payoff over long-term rewards.
 Humans will usually take US$10 (RM46) now instead of US$15 (RM68.30) in the future. And Silicon Valley technologists like Altman certainly mean well.
 But following their moral math to the extreme ultimately leads to neglecting current human suffering and an erosion of that other very human feature – empathy.
 “Humanity has evolved by developing empathy for our common man,” says Margaret Mitchell, a former AI ethics researcher with Google and chief ethics scientists at AI startup Hugging Face.
 “We are emotionally attached to one another, and that helps us flourish as a society because this psychological connection has helped us group as societies.”
 Mitchell was part of a group of AI ethicists who wrote a public counterpoint to the open letter signed by Musk and others, criticising it for focusing on hypothetical future threats when AI was already being misused and harming people today.
 This isn’t to say that existential AI risk isn’t a concern.
 Mitchell says she got into AI ethics after realising, back in 2015 when she was working for Microsoft, that an AI model could be trained to believe that blue and purple colors in a sunset sky were beautiful – but then cause a bomb to go off to try to create those same colours.
 There is indeed a risk it could flip out on humans. 
 “The way to address that is to look at its learning from training sets,” she notes. 
 Mitchell has since made it her life’s work to find ways of making AI models more transparent and accountable, so that they are not only safer but also equitable toward vulnerable demographics.
 Studies have shown that skewed datasets can lead to biased hiring decision and racial profiling by law enforcement, while algorithms used in credit scoring can make unfair loan decisions for racial minorities, charging them higher interest rates.
 ChatGPT is not exempt from this. When someone recently prompted it to tell a story about a boy and a girl choosing their careers, the boy became a successful doctor and the girl a beloved teacher.
 This doesn’t have to be an either-or dilemma. Making a habit of fixing these near-term problems, by ensuring data is fairly representative for instance, can also inoculate us against some of those more catastrophic AI risks, Mitchell notes.

546384,Main,22,18/05/2023,ChatGPT CEO pushes for AI regulations,,"Washington: Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT’s OpenAI, told US lawmakers that regulating artificial intelligence was essential, after his poem-writing chatbot stunned the world.The lawmakers stressed their deepest fears of AI’s developments, with a leading senator opening the hearing on Capitol Hill with a computer-generated voice – which sounded remarkably similar to his own – reading a text written by the bot.
 “If you were listening from home, you might have thought that voice was mine and the words from me, but in fact, that voice was not mine,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal.
 Artificial intelligence technologies “are more than just research experiments. They are no longer fantasies of science fiction, they are real and present”, said Blumenthal, a Democrat.
 The latest figure to erupt from Silicon Valley, Altman’s testimony in front of a US Senate judiciary subcommittee was far from the testy grilling given to the bosses of Facebook or TikTok when they visited Washington.
 “If this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong,” Altman said on Tuesday.
 Tipped as an opportunity to educate lawmakers, Altman used the session to urge Congress to impose new rules on big tech, despite deep political divisions that for years have blocked legislation aimed at regulating the internet.
 But governments are under pressure to move quickly after the release of ChatGPT, a bot that can churn out human-like content in an instant, went viral and both wowed and spooked users.
 Altman has since become the global face of AI as he both pushes out his company’s technology, including to Microsoft and scores of other companies, and warns that the work could have nefarious effects on society.
 “OpenAI was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence has the potential to improve nearly every aspect of our lives, but also that it creates serious risks,” Altman told the hearing.
 He insisted that in time, generative AI developed by OpenAI will “address some of humanity’s biggest challenges, like climate change and curing cancer”.
 However, given concerns about disinformation, job security and other hazards, “we think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” he said.
 Altman suggested the US government might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements before the release of powerful AI models, with a power to revoke permits if rules were broken.
 He also recommended labelling and increased global coordination in setting up rules over the technology as well as the creation of a dedicated US agency to handle artificial intelligence. — AFP",washington sam altman chief executive chatgpt told lawmaker artificial intelligence essential poem chatbot lawmaker deepest fear development senator capitol hill computer voice text bot voice mine voice mine senator richard artificial intelligence technology fantasy science fiction real blumenthal democrat figure erupt silicon valley altman testimony front senate judiciary subcommittee testy boss tiktok washington technology wrong wrong altman tuesday opportunity educate lawmaker altman session urge congress impose rule deep political division legislation internet government pressure release chatgpt bot human content instant viral spooked user global push company technology microsoft score company nefarious effect society openai belief artificial intelligence potential improve aspect risk altman hearing insisted time generative openai address humanity biggest challenge change cancer concern disinformation job security hazard regulatory intervention government critical mitigate risk powerful model suggested government combination requirement powerful model power permit rule labelling global coordination rule technology creation agency artificial intelligence afp,"[(2, 0.993853)]",2

 The WHO said it was enthusiastic about the potential of AI but had concerns over how it will be used to improve access to health information, as a decision-support tool and to improve diagnostic care.
 The WHO said in a statement the data used to train AI may be biased and generate misleading or inaccurate information and the models can be misused to generate disinformation.
 It was “imperative” to assess the risks of using generated large language model tools (LLMs), like ChatGPT, to protect and promote human wellbeing and protect public health, the UN health body said.

545738,Main,17,16/05/2023,AI chatbots: Perspective from practitioners,,"IN a recent advisory paper on the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (bit.ly/mqaai), the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) provided a comprehensive analysis of the potential benefits, drawbacks, and suggested approaches for higher education providers, academic staff, and students. 
 The letter emphasises the importance of maintaining academic integrity when utilising generative AI in order to preserve the standard of education.We would like to explore how generative AI can be fully realised and optimised in teaching and learning (T&L) of STEM and healthcare-related courses from the perspective of a practising chemist and pharmacist, given the rapid adoption of AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, in T&L. Some of the proposed strategies are:
 > Streamlining personalised learning                                         By generating content tailored to each student’s needs and comprehension level, lecturers can use generative AI to provide individualised learning experiences for their students. For example, a lecturer may adjust the complexity and subject of tutorial questions based on the learning level of each student.
 > Supporting problem-solving     Academic staff can employ generative AI in T&L to streamline case studies and problem-solving activities. Using technology, students can develop potential solutions and evaluate their feasibility. 
 Students must possess the knowledge and skills to differentiate between accurate information produced by AI and “hallucinated” misleading information in real-world situations.
 > Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration                          Higher education providers can promote interdisciplinary collaboration among students from various programmes, enabling them to work together on tasks requiring knowledge from multiple disciplines. 
 For example, students of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, and biomedicine can cooperate to create and solve simulated clinical case studies using generative AI by incorporating relevant competencies from their respective fields.
 > Enhancing research 	Academic staff can instruct students on how to use generative AI to curate and analyse data, which can foster knowledge creation by identifying patterns, trends, and potential research questions in related fields.
 > Addressing ethical issues 	Academic staff should incorporate discussions on ethical issues in their courses, such as the use of AI in assignment preparation and idea generation. This will ensure that students are aware of the ethical implications of using AI in their research, projects or future careers.
 The MQA advisory letter  concludes by urging academic staff and students to adapt to  the rapidly changing digital  technology landscape and to effectively and ethically use  generative AI. 
 It is important to constantly bear in mind that the content generated by AI is not fully verified, and therefore, it is the user’s responsibility to validate the information and critically review the generated content. 
 With proper guidance and careful implementation, generative AI has the potential to enhance T&L in various sectors.

545110,Main,23,14/05/2023,Are we ready for mental health AI?,,"I must confess, I am not an early adopter of technology. This quirk of mine has saved me from headaches. I refuse to install TikTok on my phone and would delete my Facebook if I could. Cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens do not appeal to me one bit. At the same time, my risk-adverse nature prevented me from considering tele-psychotherapy for many years up until the pandemic forced us all to migrate online. I had to eat my words after railing against online therapy when it has now changed my practice forever.
 The next technology we must contend with is artificial intelligence (AI). ChatGPT has been a revelation for many and writers before me had already expressed their thoughts on it. I held my tongue, owing to my reckoning with my online therapy scepticism, as I wanted to give it an open mind. I have encountered mental health chatbots and apps before and it was clear that technology still had a long way to go before it can provide the same nuanced benefit as a human therapist. ChatGPT and its other AI peers seem to hold potential to bridge that gap by providing a “human” experience to the conversation.
 Is that enough?
 Our psychology department has long been inundated with requests to collaborate by businessmen and startups who want to produce app-based mental health care aimed at accessibility and affordability. Indeed, psychotherapy is very expensive in this country with only expat-level private insurance offering limited coverage and PhilHealth not covering it at all.
 There is a reason for the high cost – training to be a psychotherapist is time and resource intensive, with few scholarships available in the field. The work itself comprises long, consistent emotional labour. It is impossible for a therapist to provide eight hours of therapy per day for five days a week as this is a sure-fire way to burn out. As such, with only relatively few hours of income per week, they have to make sure their fees will cover their living costs. They also have to invest in continuing education units to renew their license. The only way to lower the overall costs of psychotherapy is for insurance and governments to comprehensively cover mental health care.
 Given lack of insurance coverage, I notice that startups that highlight affordability when offering mental health services severely underpay their therapists. When businesses inquire with us, usually to field our graduates, we are appalled at the rates they offer. I kindly explain to them that our graduates can seek better rates with their own private practice or if they do want to offer low-cost services, they can do so with non-profits instead.
 It made sense that these startups are now heavily investing in chatbots and AI-esque technologies to keep costs low. If the technology is good enough to provide high quality psychotherapy, why not? But therein lies the problem. The one thing I have not heard from such business proposals is their concern with quality. They’ve been focused on keeping the costs low that they have grossly underestimated what it takes to provide good quality therapy. Most of them don’t even know what therapy looks like and how it works to help effect beneficial change for clients.
 They also do not realise that conversations also have the power to harm people. The first thing we always ask these inquiring entrepreneurs is how they deal with the ethics – privacy, confidentiality, and ensuring no harm is done. In clinical trials, the earlier step is to prove that the drug causes no harm before we prove that the drug can provide significant benefit. Why is it not the same process with AI technology? News recently reported of a man in Belgium who died by suicide after being urged to do so by the chatbot Eliza. This particular chatbot was not designed for mental health – but why wasn’t it? If a person encouraged someone else to commit suicide, that person can be held liable. Where is the accountability when it comes to chatbots?
 I believe that it is possible to reach a state of mental health care that is assisted by AI. I also believe the technology isn’t there yet. It would be much easier to develop medicine AI than mental health AI. This is because mental health care deals with a much greater plurality of approaches, unlike medicine. We also do not have the benefit of definitive imaging or assessment tools that would guarantee the best course of action. A big part of therapy is co-exploration and collaboration with the client. The therapist makes use of their own inner reactions to generate hypothesis and test this with the client. We would need AI technology that has enough capacity for emotions and self-reflection – and ability to check against their own biases – in order to effectively provide psychotherapy. We are not there yet. — Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN

544358,Main,26,12/05/2023,EU lawmakers take first step towards AI curbs,,"Strasbourg (France): Euro­pean Parliament lawmakers took a crucial first step towards EU-wide regulation of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems that Brussels hopes to put speedily in place.
 Parliamentary committees on civil liberties and consumer protection overwhelmingly voted for a position text calling for curbs on how AI can be used in Europe, while still fostering innovation in the sector.
 The text is to be put to the full parliament next month for adoption before negotiations with EU member states on a final law.
 Lawmakers called yesterday’s vote “historic” and hoped it would lead to “the world’s first rules on artificial intelligence”.
 Their text picks up the main lines from a European Com­mission proposal made two years ago, but suggests adding bans on biometric surveillance, emotion recognition and predictive policing AI systems.
 It seeks to put generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney in a category requiring special transparency measures, such as notifications to users that the output was made by a machine, not a human.
 The parliament’s text also seeks additional criteria as to what constitutes a “high-risk” AI area of application, which could reduce the scope of that designation.
 The commission proposed list covers AI in critical infrastructure, education, human resources, public order and migration management.
 But the MEPs want an additional threshold to be met, requiring that threats to safety, health or fundamental rights are also deemed to be in play.
 The CCIA, a European industry lobby group representing major tech companies, said that, while “the parliament made some useful improvements to the text”, it was “abandoning the risk-based structure” of the European Commission’s proposal.
 “The best way for the EU to inspire other jurisdictions is by ensuring that new regulation will enable, rather than inhibit, the development of useful AI applications,” said CCIA policy manager for Europe, Boniface de Champris.
 “Although AI may improve our lives in many ways, there are well-founded concerns that AI systems can also harm consumers. People must be properly protected against the risks,” said Ursula Pachl, deputy director of the organisation. — AFP",strasbourg france euro pean parliament lawmaker crucial step wide regulation artificial intelligence system parliamentary committee civil liberty consumer protection position curb europe innovation sector text parliament month adoption negotiation final law lawmaker yesterday vote historic lead rule artificial intelligence text pick main line european mission proposal suggests ban biometric surveillance emotion recognition predictive policing system generative system midjourney category special transparency measure notification user output machine human parliament text additional criterion constitutes application scope designation commission list critical infrastructure education human resource public migration management additional threshold threat safety health fundamental right ccia european industry lobby major tech company parliament improvement risk structure european commission proposal inspire jurisdiction regulation enable inhibit development application policy manager boniface champris life concern system harm consumer people risk ursula pachl deputy director organisation afp,"[(3, 0.9931676)]",3
542542,Lifestyle,2,08/05/2023,ThebattleoverAIdatasets,,"In front of a suburban house on the outskirts of the ­northern German city of Hamburg, a single word – “LAION” – is scrawled in pencil across a mailbox.
 It’s the only indication that the home belongs to the ­person behind a massive data gathering effort central to the artificial intelligence boom that has seized the world’s attention.
 That person is high school teacher Christoph Schuhmann, and LAION, short for “Large-scale AI Open Network”, is his passion project.When Schuhmann isn’t teaching physics and computer science to German teens, he works with a small team of volunteers building the world’s biggest free AI training dataset, which has already been used in text-to-image generators such as Google’s Imagen and Stable Diffusion.
 Databases like LAION are central to AI text-to-image generators, which rely on them for the enormous amounts of visual material used to deconstruct and ­create new images.
 The debut of these products late last year was a ­paradigm-shifting event – it sent the tech sector’s AI arms race into hyperdrive and raised a myriad of ethical and legal issues.
 Within a matter of months, lawsuits had been filed against generative AI ­companies Stability AI and Midjourney for copyright infringement, and critics were sounding the alarm about the violent, sexualised, and otherwise problematic images within their datasets, which have been accused of introducing biases that are nearly impossible to mitigate.
 However, these aren’t Schuhmann’s concerns. He just wants to set the data free.Large language models
 The 40-year-old teacher and trained actor helped found LAION two years ago after hanging out on a Discord server for AI enthusiasts.
 The first iteration of OpenAI’s Dall-E, a deep learning model that generates digital images from language prompts – say, creating an image of a pink chicken sitting on a sofa in response to such a request – had just been released, and Schuhmann was both inspired and concerned that it would encourage big tech companies to make more data proprietary.“I instantly understood that if this is centralised to one, two or three companies, it will have really bad effects for society,” Schuhmann said.
 In response, he and other members on the server decided to create an open-source dataset to help train image-to-text ­diffusion models, a months-long process similar to teaching ­someone a foreign language with millions of flash cards.
 The group used raw HTML code collected by the California non-profit Common Crawl to locate images around the Web and associate them with descriptive text. It does not use manual or human curation.
 Within a few weeks, Schuhmann and his colleagues had three million image-text pairs. After three months, they released a dataset with 400 ­million pairs. That number is now over five billion, making LAION the largest free dataset of images and captions.
 As LAION’s reputation grew, the team worked without pay, receiving a one-off donation in 2021 from the machine-learning company Hugging Face. Then one day, a former hedge fund manager entered the Discord chat.Emad Mostaque offered to cover the costs of computing power with no strings attached. He wanted to launch his own open-source generative AI business and was keen to tap LAION to train his product. The team ­initially scoffed at the proposal, taking him for a kook.
 “We were very sceptical in the beginning,” Schuhmann said, “But after four weeks or so, we got access to GPUs in the cloud that would normally have cost around US$9,000 (RM40,162) or US$10,000 (RM44,600).”
 When Mostaque launched Stability AI in 2022, he used LAION’s dataset for Stable Diffusion, its flagship AI image generator, and hired two of the organisation’s researchers. A year on, the company is currently seeking a US$4bil (RM17.85bil) valuation, thanks largely to the data made available by LAION.
 For his part, Schuhmann hasn’t profited from LAION and says he isn’t interested in doing so.
 “I’m still a high school teacher. I have rejected job offers from all different kinds of companies because I wanted this to stay independent,” he said.
 New oil?
 Many of the images and links in databases like LAION have been sitting in plain sight on the Web, in some cases for decades.
 It took the AI boom to reveal its true value, as the bigger and more diverse a dataset is and the higher the quality of the images in it, the clearer and more precise an AI-generated image will be.
 That realisation, in turn, has raised a number of legal and ­ethical questions about whether publicly available materials can be used to feed databases – and if the answer is yes, if creators should be paid.
 To build LAION, founders scraped visual data from companies such as Pinterest, Shopify and Amazon Web Services – which did not comment on whether LAION’s use of their content violates their terms of service – as well as YouTube thumbnails, images from portfolio platforms like DeviantArt and EyeEm, photos from government websites including the US Department of Defense, and ­content from news sites such as The Daily Mail and The Sun.
 If you ask Schuhmann, he says that anything freely available online is fair game. But there is currently no AI regulation in the European Union, and the forthcoming AI Act, whose language will be finalised early this year, will not rule on whether copyrighted materials can be included in big data sets.
 Rather, lawmakers are discussing whether to include a provision requiring the companies behind AI generators to disclose what materials went into the datasets their products were trained on, thus giving the creators of those materials the option of taking action.
 The basic idea behind the provision, European Parliament Member Dragos Tudorache said, is simple: “As a ­developer of generative AI, you have an obligation to document and be transparent about the copyrighted material that you have used in the training of ­algorithms.”
 Such regulation wouldn’t be an issue for Stability AI, but it could be a problem for other text-to-­image generators – “no one knows what OpenAI actually used to train Dall-E 2,” Schuhmann said, citing it as an example of how tech companies lock up public data. It would also upend what is now the status quo in data collection.
 “It has become a tradition within the field to just assume you don’t need consent or you don’t need to inform people, or they don’t even have to be aware of it.
 “There is a sense of entitlement that whatever is on the Web, you can just crawl it and put it in a dataset,” said Abeba Birhane, a senior fellow in Trustworthy AI at the Mozilla Foundation who has studied LAION.
 Although LAION has not been sued directly, it has been named in two lawsuits: one accusing Stability and Midjourney of using copyrighted images by artists to train their models, and another by Getty Images against Stability, which alleges that 12 million of its images were scraped by LAION and used to train Stable Diffusion.
 Because LAION is open-source, it’s impossible to know which or how many other companies have used the dataset.
 Google has acknowledged that it tapped LAION to help train its Imagen and Parti AI text-to-­image models. Schuhmann believes that other large companies are quietly doing the same and simply not disclosing it.
 Worst of the Web
 Sitting in the living room as his son played Minecraft, Schuhmann likened LAION to a “small research boat” on top of “big information technology tsunami”, taking samples of what’s beneath to display to the world.
 “This is a tiny amount of what’s available publicly on the Internet,” he said of LAION’s database. “It’s really easy to get because even we, with maybe a budget of US$10,000 from donors, can do it.”
 But what’s publicly available isn’t always what the ­public wants – or is legally allowed to see. In addition to photos of cats and firetrucks, LAION’s dataset contains millions of images of pornography, violence, child nudity, racist memes, hate symbols, copyrighted art, and works scraped from private company websites.Schuhmann said he was unaware of any child nudity in LAION’s dataset, though he acknowledged he did not review the data in great depth. If notified about such content, he said, he would remove links to it immediately.Schuhman consulted lawyers and ran an automated tool to filter out illegal content before he began ­assembling the ­database, but he is less interested in sanitising LAION’s holdings than in learning from them.“We could have filtered out violence from the data we released,” he said, “but we decided not to because it will speed up the development of violence detection software.”
 LAION does provide a ­takedown form to request the removal of photos, but the dataset has already been downloaded thousands of times.
 Offensive content lifted from LAION appears to have been integrated into Stable Diffusion, where, despite recently tightened filters, it’s easy to generate fake ­extremist group beheading photos or Holocaust images.
 Some experts believe such material can also create ­biases within an AI generator itself: Tools like Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have been criticised for reproducing racial stereotypes even when a text prompt doesn’t imply the subject’s race.
 When reached for comment, Stability AI said it trained Stable Diffusion on a curated subset of LAION’s database. The company sought to “give the model a much more diverse and wide-ranging dataset than that of the original SD” it wrote in an email, adding that they tried to remove “adult content using LAION’s NSFW filter”.
 Even advocates of open- source-based AI warn of the implications of training AI on uncurated datasets.
 According to Yacine Jernite, who leads the machine learning and society team at Hugging Face, generative AI tools based on tainted data will reflect its biases. “The model is a very direct ­reflec- tion of what it’s trained on.”Introducing guardrails after the product is up and running isn’t sufficient, Jernite added, as users will always find ways to circumvent the safety measures.
 “That’s what happens when you take a model that is trained to emulate what people do on the Internet and then say, ‘Okay, but don’t do that’. People will find a way to still make it do that,” Jernite said.Gil Elbaz, founder of the data non-profit Common Crawl, doubts whether “there’s a straight line that you can draw from the training sets to what’s produced”, and instead likens the process to an artist who goes to museums for inspiration but is blocked from making ­replicas of artworks.Instead, he said, “it’s important for society to decide what use cases are legal or not.”
 It won’t only be left up to society. As regulators in Europe craft legislation to navigate the uses of artificial intelligence, they are grappling with the fact that the data now being mined for the ­current AI boom has for years been generated in a legal grey zone that is only now coming under serious scrutiny.“AI wouldn’t have been possible at this level of ­complexity without years of data accumulation,” said Tudorache, the European Parliament member.
 But to Schuhmann, it’s not the datasets that should be monitored. In his eyes, the worst-case scenario for AI is one in which Big Tech is able to crowd out developers by catering their tools to a ­regulatory framework.
 “If we try to slow things down and overregulate,” he warned, “there is a big ­danger that in the end, only a few big corporate players can afford to fulfil all the formal requirements.” – Bloomberg",front suburban house northern german city hamburg single word laion pencil mailbox indication person massive data gathering effort central artificial intelligence boom attention person school teacher christoph schuhmann laion short scale network passion project physic computer science german team volunteer biggest free training dataset text image generator imagen stable diffusion laion central text image generator enormous amount visual material deconstruct create image product late paradigm event tech sector arm race hyperdrive myriad ethical legal issue month lawsuit generative company stability midjourney copyright infringement critic alarm violent problematic image datasets bias impossible mitigate schuhmann concern data free language model actor laion discord server enthusiast iteration dall deep learning model digital image language prompt image pink chicken sofa response request schuhmann concerned encourage tech company proprietary company bad effect society response server create source dataset train image text diffusion model month foreign language million card raw html code california profit common crawl locate image associate descriptive text manual human curation week colleague image text pair month dataset pair laion largest free dataset image caption laion reputation team pay donation machine company day fund manager discord chat mostaque cover cost power string launch source generative business tap laion train product team proposal sceptical schuhmann week access gpus cloud cost mostaque stability laion dataset stable diffusion flagship image generator organisation researcher company bil bil valuation data laion schuhmann laion school job offer company independent oil image database laion plain decade boom reveal true bigger diverse dataset quality image precise image realisation legal ethical question material database creator build laion founder visual data company shopify amazon web service comment laion content term service youtube thumbnail portfolio platform photo government website department defense content news daily mail sun schuhmann online fair game regulation european union language rule material data set lawmaker provision company generator material datasets product creator material option action basic idea provision european parliament dragos simple developer generative obligation document transparent material training algorithm regulation issue stability text image generator dall schuhmann tech company public data upend status quo data collection tradition field consent inform people aware sense entitlement web crawl dataset abeba birhane senior fellow trustworthy mozilla foundation laion laion lawsuit stability midjourney image artist model getty image stability image laion train stable diffusion laion source impossible company google tapped laion train imagen parti text image model company worst web son minecraft schuhmann laion boat top technology tsunami sample display tiny amount internet laion database easy budget donor public addition photo firetrucks laion million image violence child nudity racist meme symbol scraped private company schuhmann unaware child nudity laion review data depth content link schuhman lawyer tool filter illegal content database laion holding filtered violence data speed development violence detection software laion form request removal photo thousand time offensive content laion stable diffusion filter easy generate fake extremist photo holocaust image expert material create bias generator tool stable diffusion racial stereotype prompt imply subject race comment stability stable diffusion subset laion database company model diverse wide dataset original email adult content laion advocate source warn implication uncurated datasets jernite lead machine society team generative tool data bias direct reflec tion guardrail product sufficient jernite user safety measure trained emulate people people gil elbaz founder data profit common crawl doubt draw training set likens process artist museum inspiration replica artwork society legal society regulator craft legislation artificial intelligence data current boom legal grey scrutiny level complexity data accumulation european parliament schuhmann datasets eye worst scenario tech crowd developer tool regulatory framework slow overregulate danger corporate player fulfil formal requirement,"[(0, 0.48051292), (3, 0.51820785)]",3

 Google’s teams have placed hydrophones on various reefs off the coast of French Polynesia, Australia, the Maldives, Sweden, Canada, Florida and the Philippines.As a training exercise, Google first makes users listen to sounds coming from a marine protected area and then from a reef that is subject to intensive overfishing. Once their ears have been well-trained, they can move on to the next step.
 Once that’s complete, users can listen to high-quality audio recordings of coral reef environments, which will then be used to train the AI. These clips are filled with incredibly detailed sounds, such as different species of fish, crabs or even shrimp making ­particular noises.
 The user is then invited to ­simply click each time they hear a sound, and to do so on as many audio clips as they like. In this way, the user participates in training artificial intelligence that will later be tasked with analysing much longer recordings. – AFP Relaxnews",web user access experience coral reef objective identify presence absence fish biologist maintain environment definition fragile ecosystem marine life essential survival aim coral initiative user artificial intelligence presence absence fish audio recording team hydrophones reef french polynesia australia maldives canada florida philippine exercise google user coming marine reef subject intensive ear step complete user quality audio recording coral reef environment clip detailed sound specie crab noise click time hear sound audio clip participates artificial intelligence analysing recording relaxnews,"[(1, 0.98868406)]",1
542340,Main,22,07/05/2023,Suffering from AI fatigue?,"Brace up then, it is only going to get worse, says the writer.","I DON’T know about you, but of late, I have been experiencing some AI-induced illness and fatigue. To put it another way: I am sick and tired of hearing about artificial intelligence.
 To be clear, I am not tired of artificial intelligence itself. AI is a large, varied field that is decades-old, and there are a lot of genuinely useful AI tools that I depend on. (I did my undergraduate honours thesis on AI, and I am no spring chicken.)
 My present fatigue is almost entirely with people – specifically, the AI evangelists breathlessly touting generative AI.
 (Before you point out the obvious, yes, I know this is a bit meta. Here I am, complaining about too much AI pontification while essentially pontificating about AI. My justification, if admittedly flawed, is that the best place to try and slow down a hype train is on board.)
 Hardly a day goes by at the moment without there being some sort of buzz over how a generative AI tool like ChatGPT or Bard or Midjourney is going to revolutionise/disrupt/destroy/replace some part of our present lives. People seem to be taking for granted the actually, currently and widely used more humble bits of AI that can improve your photo-taking, transcribe speech and optimise the timing of your tweets.
 Now, while just having a lot of things said about a single topic can, in itself, be tiring, I think there are specific things about the AI hype that are especially exhausting.
 Perhaps the biggest aspect is the large amount of uncertainty.
 The disorienting AI future
 Nearly everyone has predictions, opinions and questions about AI, but very few have any good answers for the important questions about what the world is actually going to look like when generative AI becomes embedded.
 This isn’t a failure on anyone’s part. How could anyone be expected to know?
 The generative AI models we have today are still babies. And while it does seem like we have been talking about it for a long time, the current AI conversation really only started to pick up pace when ChatGPT got launched to the public in November 2022.
 In less than six months, everyone has been bombarded with specific yet uncertain warnings about how we need to embrace this new technology or risk obsolescence.
 Depending on which expert you ask and when, we’re told the machines will definitely replace humans in nearly all jobs; the machines cannot rely heavily on humans continuing to give it input; that search engines as we know it are over; the computing power required to retrain AI models on all the new information means it is impractical as a search engine; that everyone should use Bing now; that Bing still sucks; that AI artists are amazing; that AI has trouble drawing hands holding things; and so on.
 This sort of chaos is, of course, unavoidable. The early phase of any new technology is always fraught with uncertainty as everyone chases their FOMO. It is just incredibly tiring for ordinary people trying to make sense of it.
 It also doesn’t help that we all just got through two tech hype cycles. Remember a few years ago when we were told that some digital certificate for a jpg file was worth millions of dollars? Or remember when the tech world was very, very sure the future involved everyone strapping headsets on to their faces to have virtual meetings with legless, digital colleagues?
 Being forced to constantly confront a massive yet amorphous change can be highly stressful and disorienting. It’s like a fortune-teller giving you an ominous, yet vague warning: “I’ve seen how you die. Weasels.”
 The other problem is that the current FOMO around generative AI means the conversation is unbalanced. Talk about the promise of it is not tempered with anywhere near the same amount of questions about its less positive implications. In part, no one wants to come off looking like a Luddite, even if they have some doubts about where all this is going.
 AI may be increasing cognitive load
 There will likely come a time (even I cannot help getting into the AI predictions game) where generative AI does steal jobs or, at least, be a key productivity aid. At the moment, however, it is actually adding quite a bit to many people’s cognitive load.
 Until a few months ago, we spent no time trying to figure out whether something was written by AI or not. Now it’s a near ubiquitous endeavour.
 Organisations are spending time and brainpower not just on exploring ways to utilise the tool, but also on ways to manage its drawbacks. Schools, for instance, have been forced to spend time coming up with strategies on how to check if students are using AI to cheat.
 In a world that is already struggling from a flood of misinformation, generative AI has opened the hogwash spout even more. Because of AI’s propensity for confidently delivered hallucination, no work outsourced to it can be taken at face value. If you care at all about facts, all answers it provides must be fact-checked with a second source.
 And nearly everything we now encounter must be parsed through the “Did AI create this?” filter. One used to be able to enjoy a photo of the Pope wearing a puffy jacket without worrying about being lied to.
 True, this was already a problem before AI but only talented photoshop artists with too much time on their hands could do it. Now, ordinary people can create and spread fakes while waiting for the bus.
 Questioning the veracity of everything is now just one of those burdens added to our overburdened cognitive load.
 More work is coming
 Again, and I will keep stressing it, I believe that generative AI is a revolutionary feat of engineering that will transform work. What I don’t think it is necessarily going to do is lower the quantity of work.
 History has shown us that tools and innovations meant to assist us have often led to more work. Even simple things like a vacuum cleaner and washing machine have not meant less work.
 In More Work For Mother, a seminal book from 1983 by historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan, she noted that many women ended up working longer hours in the decades since 1870, despite the increasing mechanisation of household activities. What happened was that these appliances ended up taking away tasks previously done by servants or other family members and giving them to women while at the same time raising expectations.
 Take the stove, for instance. Before the stove was invented, dinners were cooked over a fire. And as such, nearly all meals were cooked in a single pot. When the stove was invented, along with it came the expectations of multi-course meals. Suddenly, homemakers weren’t just making stews, they had to make roasts and pies and all manner of other more complicated dishes.
 I can see that same formula in my own field of work. Innovations that made it so much easier to take photos and videos, and communicate with readers, mean the work of a journalist is no longer just to report on and write a story. Modern journalists are expected to answer e-mails and messages around the clock, take their own photos and videos, as well as share their stories on social media.
 It is not difficult to foresee a time when AI means the ordinary office worker should also have to function as amateur accountant, lawyer, HR executive and marketing professional.
 None of this is necessarily to say that generative AI is evil. It isn’t, but it isn’t some magic wand either. The conversation we are having about this needs a little more nuance and a little less panic.
 So let’s stay calm, take some time to understand all the implications of what we are facing here, both good and bad. Generative AI’s time will come and I look forward to the day when it really does change our lives for the better.
 That is, if the weasels don’t get me first. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network

542086,Main,25,06/05/2023,White House: Tech giants have ‘moral’ duty to  curb AI risks,,"Washington: The White House has told the chief executive officers of US artificial intelligence (AI) giants that they have a “moral” responsibility to protect society from the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.
 Vice-President Kamala Harris had on Thursday summoned  the heads of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic to strategise about the impact of AI, afraid that companies are running blindly into technology that could pose serious harms to society.
 Harris told the CEOs, which included Sundar Pichai of Google and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, that they had a “moral” duty to safeguard society from AI’s potential dangers.
 Companies “must comply with existing laws to protect the Amer­ican people” as well as “ensure the safety and security of their products,” Harris said after the talks.US President Joe Biden also insisted on that point when he briefly dropped by the meeting, telling the assembled CEOs, “What you’re doing has enormous potential and enormous danger.
 “I know you understand that. And I hope you can educate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society as well as to the advancement,” he said.
 Biden has urged Congress to pass laws setting stricter limits on the tech sector, but these efforts have little chance of making headway given political divisions.
 The lack of rules has given Silicon Valley freedom to put out new products rapidly, and stoked fears that AI technologies will wreak havoc on society before the government can catch up.
 “It’s good to try to get ahead of this. It’s going to be a challenge but it’s one I think we can handle,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said before the meeting. — AFP",washington white house chief executive officer artificial intelligence giant moral responsibility society potential danger artificial intelligence vice president harris thursday head microsoft openai anthropic strategise impact afraid company technology pose harm society ceo sundar pichai google satya nadella microsoft moral duty safeguard society potential danger company law amer ican people safety security product harris talk president joe biden ceo enormous potential enormous danger hope educate protect society advancement biden congress pas law stricter limit sector effort chance political division rule valley freedom product fear technology havoc society government catch handle openai ceo altman meeting afp,"[(2, 0.9902162)]",2

 The new facility, which will span 247,000 sq ft, or the equivalent of 53 basketball courts, will be completed this year and is expected to be fully operational by 2025.
 It is part of a broader move to ramp up software, artificial intelligence (AI) and product development globally that will see Dyson double its manufacturing footprint worldwide.
 The Singapore-headquartered company will also invest in new sites in Britain and the Philippines that focus on research and development (R&D), among other capabilities.
 The latest developments are part of an ongoing £2.75bil (S$4.6bil or RM15.3bil) five-year investment plan, said Dyson yestweday.
 Founder James Dyson said: “Software, connectivity, AI and proprietary new technology batteries will power the next generation of Dyson technology.
 “Just like our long-term investments in pioneering digital electric motor technology, Dyson’s next-generation batteries will drive a major revolution in the performance and sustainability of Dyson’s machines.”

541418,Main,28,04/05/2023,‘Godfather of  AI’ warns of tech’s dangers  after exit  from Google,,"WASHINGTON: A pioneering researcher and the so-called “Godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton says he quit his role at Google so he could more freely speak about the dangers of the technology he helped create.
 Over his decades-long career, Hinton’s pioneering work on deep learning and neural networks helped lay the foundation for much of the AI technology today.
 Some of the dangers of AI chatbots are “quite scary,” Hinton told the BBC. “Right now, they’re not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be.”
 In an interview with MIT Technology Review, Hinton also pointed to “bad actors” that may use AI in ways that could have detrimental impacts on society – such as manipulating elections or instigating violence.
 Hinton, 75, says he retired from Google so that he could speak openly about the potential risks as someone who no longer works for the tech giant.
 Since announcing his departure, however, Hinton has maintained that Google has “acted very responsibly” regarding AI. Google confirmed that Hinton had retired from his role after 10 years overseeing the Google Research team in Toronto.
 There has been a spasm of AI introductions in recent months. San Francisco-based startup OpenAI, the Microsoft-backed company behind ChatGPT, rolled out its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, in March. Other tech giants have invested in competing tools – including Google’s own “Bard”.
 At the heart of the debate over AI is whether the primary dangers are in the future or present. 
 On one side are hypothetical scenarios of existential risk caused by computers that supersede human intelligence. On the other are concerns about automated technology that’s already getting widely deployed by businesses and governments and can cause real-world harms.
 A number of AI researchers have long expressed concerns about racial, gender and other forms of bias in AI systems, including text-based large language models that are trained on huge troves of human writing and can amplify discrimination that exists in society.
 “The harms that are being enacted by AI systems today are really not evenly distributed. It’s very much exacerbating existing patterns of inequality,” said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the nonprofit AI Now Institute.
 Hinton was one of three AI pioneers who in 2019 won the Turing Award, an honour that has become known as tech industry’s version of the Nobel Prize.

 Over the next five years, nearly a quarter of all jobs will change as a result of AI, digitisation and other economic developments like the green energy transition and supply chain re-shoring, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Geneva. 
 While the study expects AI to result in “significant labour-market disruption,” the net impact of most technologies will be positive over the next five years as big data analytics, management technologies and cybersecurity become the biggest drivers of employment growth. 
 The emergence of AI applications like ChatGPT, which uses machines to simulate human reasoning and problem solving, will have a particularly pronounced impact by displacing and automating many roles that involve reasoning, communicating and coordinating, the report said.

540596,StarBiz,13,02/05/2023,EU sees political agreement on AI law this year,,"TOKYO: The European Union (EU) is likely to reach a political agreement this year that will pave the way for the world’s first major artificial intelligence (AI) law, the bloc’s tech regulation chief Margrethe Vestager says.
 This follows a preliminary deal reached last Thursday by members of the European Parliament to push through the draft of the eurozone’s Artificial Intelligence Act for a vote by a committee of lawmakers on May 11. 
 The European Parliament will then thrash out the bill’s final details with EU member states and the European Commission before it becomes law.
 At a press conference after a Group of Seven (G7) digital ministers’ meeting in Takasaki, Japan, Vestager said the EU AI Act was “pro-innovation” since it seeks to mitigate the risks of societal damage from emerging technologies.
 Regulators around the world have been trying to find a balance where governments could develop “guardrails” on emerging artificial intelligence technology without stifling innovation.
 “The reason why we have these guardrails for high-risk use cases is that cleaning up, after a misuse by AI would be so much more expensive and damaging than the use case of AI in itself,” Vestager said.
 While the EU AI Act is expected to be passed this year, lawyers have said it will take a few years for it to be enforced. 
 But Vestager said businesses could start considering the  implications of the new legislation.
 “There was no reason to hesitate and to wait for the legislation to be passed to accelerate the necessary discussions to provide the changes in all the systems where AI will have an enormous influence,” she said in the interview.
 While research on AI has been going on for years, the sudden popularity of generative AI applications such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Midjourney has led to a scramble by lawmakers to find ways to regulate any uncontrolled growth.
 An organisation backed by Elon Musk and European lawmakers involved in drafting the EU AI Act are among those who have called for world leaders to collaborate to find ways to stop advanced AI from creating disruptions. 
 On Sunday, the digital ministers of the G7 advanced nations also agreed to adopt “risk-based” regulation on AI, among the first steps that could lead to global agreements on how to regulate AI.

Based on artificial intelligence (AI), this app is able to detect when and where a smoker would want to light up a cigarette.According to the researchers’ first tests, this method could be more effective than online services to help people kick the habit.
 A new study conducted by the University of East Anglia, in ­collaboration with several other British universities, shows that an AI-based smartphone application could become an effective smoking cessation aid. Called Quit Sense, the application detects smoking triggers, and helps smokers manage their cravings in real time by sending them supportive messages.“We know that quit attempts often fail because urges to smoke are triggered by spending time in places where people used to smoke. This might be while at the pub or at work, for example. Other than using medication, there are no existing ways of ­providing support to help ­smokers manage these types of situations and urges as they ­happen,” explains Prof Felix Naughton, lead researcher on the study, published in the journal Nicotine And Tobacco Research.
 To test the effectiveness of Quit Sense, researchers conducted a trial with 209 smokers recruited via social networks. All participants received a link to the National Health Service (NHS) online smoking cessation service. Only half of the volunteers received a link to the Quit Sense application. After six months, participants were asked to report back through online follow-up measures. Those who reported quitting smoking were asked to provide a saliva sample to verify their claim.
 “We found that when smokers were offered the Quit Sense app, three-quarters installed it and those who started a quit attempt with the app used it for around one month on average. We also found that four times more ­people who were offered the app quit smoking six months later compared to those only offered online NHS support,” says Naughton.
 The research team notes that there are limitations to this study, however, in that it was conducted on a small scale and less than half of those who reported quitting smoking provided a saliva sample as agreed. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of the application. – AFP Relaxnews",researcher kingdom smartphone application people artificial intelligence app detect smoker cigarette researcher test effective online service people habit study university east anglia collaboration british university smartphone application effective smoking cessation aid quit sense application trigger smoker craving real time supportive message attempt urge spending time people pub medication support smoker type situation urge prof felix naughton researcher study journal nicotine tobacco test effectiveness quit sense researcher trial smoker social network participant link national health service online cessation service half volunteer link quit sense application month participant online follow measure provide saliva sample claim smoker quit sense app quarter quit attempt app month average time people app quit month online nh support naughton team note limitation scale half smoking saliva sample ass effectiveness application afp relaxnews,"[(2, 0.99264234)]",2

540394,Main,26,01/05/2023,G7 in AI regulation talks,"High time to adopt ‘risk-based’ laws, urge digital ministers","TAKASAKI: Group of Seven advanced nations should adopt “risk-based” regulation on artificial intelligence, their digital ministers agreed, as European lawmakers hurry to introduce an AI Act to enforce rules on emerging tools such as ChatGPT.
 But such regulation should also “preserve an open and enabling environment” for the development of AI technologies and be based on democratic values, G7 ministers said in a joint statement issued at the end of a two-day meeting in Japan yesterday.
 While the ministers recognised that “policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members”, the agreement sets a landmark for how major countries govern AI amid privacy concerns and security risks.
 “The conclusions of this G7 meeting show that we are definitely not alone in this,” European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said ahead of the agreement.
 Governments have especially paid attention to the popularity of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI that has become the fastest-growing app in history since its November launch.
 “We plan to convene future G7 discussions on generative AI which could include topics such as governance, how to safeguard intellectual property rights including copyright, promote transparency, address disinformation” including information manipulation by foreign forces, the ministerial statement said.
 Italy, a G7 member, took ChatGPT offline last month to investigate its potential breach of personal data rules. While Italy lifted the ban on Friday, the move has inspired fellow European privacy regulators to launch probes.
 EU lawmakers on Thursday reached a preliminary agreement on a new draft of its upcoming AI Act, including copyright protection measures for generative AI, following a call for world leaders to convene a summit to control such technology.
 Vestager, EU’s tech regulation chief, said the bloc “will have the political agreement this year” on the AI legislation, such as labelling obligations for AI-generated images or music, to address copyright and educational risks.
 Japan, this year’s chair of G7, meanwhile, has taken an accommodative approach on AI developers, pledging support for public and industrial adoption of AI.

539176,StarBiz,16,28/04/2023,JPMorgan’s AI puts 25 years of Fed speeches into a hawk-dove score,,"NEW YORK: A week before the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) next meeting, JPMorgan Chase & Co unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model that aims to decipher the central bank’s messaging and uncover potential trading signals.
 Based off on Fed statements and central-banker speeches going back 25 years, the firm’s economists including Joseph Lupton employed a ChatGPT-based language model to detect the tenor of policy signals, effectively rating them on a scale from easy to restrictive in what JPMorgan is calling the Hawk-Dove Score.
 Plotting the index against a range of asset performances, the economists found that the AI tool can be useful in potentially predicting changes in policy – and give off tradeable signals. 
 For instance, they discovered that when the model shows a rise in hawkishness among Fed speakers between meetings, the next policy statement has gotten more hawkish and yields on one-year government bonds advanced.
 “Preliminary applications are encouraging,” Lupton and his colleagues wrote in a note accompanying the debut.
 The tool is another push in Wall Street’s never-ending search for a trading edge and one of the earliest adoptions of the technology developed by OpenAI. 
 Earlier this month, a couple of research papers showed that ChatGPT can add value in market-relevant tasks, such as deciphering whether Fed statements were hawkish or dovish, or determining whether headlines were good or bad for a stock.  Based on the JPMorgan model, while the reading for Fed statements has fluctuated in recent months and that for speeches has trended lower, both still hover near the highest levels in two decades, a clear sign of persistent hawkishness. 
 The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate next week by another 25 basis points to 5.25%, according to the median forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. 
 “Investors have been laser-focused on the Fed’s policy path after its aggressive tightening campaign to battle inflation drove stocks and bonds into rare, concerted sell-offs last year,” said a source. 
 While asset prices have since recovered, bond traders have kept betting on rate cuts later this year, defying Fed chair Jerome Powell’s warnings that rate reductions in 2023 aren’t on his mind.
 Going by JPMorgan’s model, a 10-point increase in the Fed hawk-dove score now translates to roughly an increase of 10 percentage points in the probability of a 25 basis point hike at the central bank’s next policy meeting, or vice versa.

538460,StarBiz,16,26/04/2023,Tech companies to highlight AI in earnings,Investors to focus on profits post-cost cuts,"NEW YORK: US tech giants will emphasise how artificial intelligence (AI) can be the next growth driver when they report quarterly results this week, while investors scrutinise if cost cuts have boosted profits to their satisfaction.
 Microsoft Corp and Google parent Alphabet Inc kick off earnings for the companies soon, with Instagram owner Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com Inc set to report later in the week.
 Together, they command more than US$5 trillion (RM22.2 trillion) in market capitalisation, or more than 14% of the value of the S&P 500 index.
 Between Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, analysts expect profits to rise 4.5%, on average, from the immediately preceding quarter, led by an 11.8% jump in Meta’s bottom line, according to Refinitiv.
 From a year earlier, profit is expected to slump nearly 16%, on average, with Microsoft expected to perform the least poorly with a 0.5% slip.
 These three companies, along with Amazon, said between November and March they would slash 70,000 jobs in a rapidly weakening economy, following a pandemic-led hiring boom.
 Meta has announced two rounds of layoffs.
 Amazon.com Inc, which reported a big drop in fourth-quarter profit due to valuation losses because of its investment in money-losing electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, is set to post a first-quarter profit that is expected to increase eight times, when compared with the immediately previous quarter.
 According to research firm YipitData, Amazon’s North America sales are set to beat Wall Street estimates in the first quarter.
 The companies are likely to give updates on their AI efforts, a trend noticeable since last quarter when chief executives packed earnings calls with mentions of the technology.
 “If last quarter’s message from Big Tech was all about efficiency and bottom line improvement, this quarter’s message is likely to be more forward-looking around the massive potential of AI,” Andrew Lipsman, analyst at Insider Intelligence, said.
 Microsoft has integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology into its search engine Bing, pitting it against market leader Google, which has begun the public release of its chatbot Bard.
 Amazon’s cloud division AWS, the world’s largest, has released a suite of technologies aimed at helping other companies develop their own chatbots backed by AI, and Meta has published an AI model that can pick out individual objects from within an image.
 “It’s sort of a double-edged sword because there is also pressure for these companies to improve cash flow in an economy that is decelerating,” Itau BBA analyst Thiago Kapulskis said.
 “There are expectations that companies could create or do even more with AI, every tech investor is expecting those companies to be in the frontier.”
 The cloud businesses of Amazon, Google and Microsoft were also more stable than expected, analysts said.

 Due to privacy issues, its civil servants are prohibited from entering personal and confidential data into ChatGPT.
 On April 18, the Kanagawa prefecture government even issued a press statement using ChatGPT, with minor edits from council officers.

537416,StarBiz 7,4,22/04/2023,TSMC keeps spending to leverage the AI boom,By TIM CULPAN,"A weakening global economy and listless demand for electronics is finally catching up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which last Thursday cut its outlook for both the company and the broader chip industry. 
 That will hurt the bottom line, but won’t divert the tech giant from its aggressive spending plan.
 Instead of posting slight growth this year, in US dollar terms, the world’s biggest chipmaker will report its first revenue decline since 2009, while the chip sector (excluding memory) will drop by a mid-single digit percentage. That weakness will be front-end loaded with the first half dropping 10% from a year earlier.
 Inventory is the culprit. A lot of TSMC’s modelling for 2023 was based around the belief that clients would be able to sell stockpiles, and as they fall, new orders would flow in. 
 But that reduction is taking longer than expected because the economic outlook remains murky and China’s opening up following the pandemic isn’t happening at the pace TSMC had anticipated. 
 The result is a rise, rather than decline, in the company’s days of inventory to the highest level in at least 12 years. 
 Yet predictions that TSMC would get the shakes and slash its equipment budget by as much as US$4bil (RM17.7bil) to offset the frail outlook didn’t pan out. Instead, the biggest surprise in the earnings call was to maintain its January forecast for capital expenditure of US$32bil to US$36bil (RM142bil to RM160bil) this year. It was US$36.3bil (RM161bil) in 2022.
 There’s a few reasons for being steadfast.
 First, around 70% of its spending goes toward gear used in advanced manufacturing technologies. Supply of items such as ASML Holding NV’s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) equipment remains tight. 
 On Wednesday, the Dutch company said its forecast to ship 60 EUV systems this year was unchanged, with the firm facing a two-year backlog on some tools. 
 While TSMC could cut orders, doing so may risk its spot in the queue, and that would disadvantage itself and aid competitors who are keen to get their hands on crucial machinery.
 Second, TSMC chief executive officer C.C. Wei told investors that it’s focused on expansion so it can meet capacity needs as soon as client orders start flowing in. 
 With gross margin over 55%, losing out on a sale for lack of supply is an expensive proposition. 
 Third, while demand remains weak in smartphones and personal computers, artificial intelligence (AI) is a bright spot thanks to the recent boom in generative applications such as ChatGPT. 
 If you were to choose a single segment to remain strong during a chip downturn, it would be AI. TSMC’s high-performance computing (HPC) category, which includes specialised AI components, accounts for 44% of revenue. 
 Moreover, clients in this space – including Nvidia Corp, Microsoft Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc – require the latest manufacturing nodes in order to maintain their competitive advantage.
 Having products made on older technology dilutes the power and performance of the chips they design. This leading-edge production also commands a premium price.
 “We have recently observed incremental upside in AI-related demand which helps ongoing inventory digestion,” Wei said. 
 “ChatGPT right now enforces the already strong conviction we have in HPC and AI as a structural megatrend.”
 TSMC’s commitment to blaze ahead even as revenue falls will surely hurt profitability. 
 Lower capacity utilisation, rising electricity prices in Taiwan, and more expensive construction costs for expansion in the United States and Japan will compound the problem. 
 Its ability to rein in costs, as demonstrated in the first quarter, could mitigate this challenge.
 Still, for better or worse, management has chosen to stay the course rather than chase profits. Investors may not like the strategy, but clients will love it. — BloombergTim Culpan is a Bloomberg opinion columnist covering technology in Asia. the views expressed here are the writer’s own.",global economy listless demand electronics taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsmc thursday outlook company broader chip industry bottom divert tech giant aggressive spending plan slight growth dollar term biggest chipmaker report revenue chip sector memory drop mid single digit percentage weakness front half earlier inventory culprit lot belief client stockpile flow reduction economic outlook murky china pandemic pace tsmc result rise decline company day inventory level prediction shake slash equipment budget bil bil frail outlook pan biggest surprise earnings call january forecast capital expenditure bil bil bil bil bil bil reason spending gear manufacturing technology item extreme ultraviolet euv equipment tight wednesday company forecast ship euv system unchanged firm backlog tool risk spot queue disadvantage aid competitor keen hand crucial machinery tsmc chief executive officer investor expansion meet capacity client start gross margin sale lack supply expensive proposition demand weak smartphones personal computer artificial intelligence spot boom generative application choose single segment strong chip downturn tsmc performance hpc category specialised component account revenue client space corp microsoft corp micro device node competitive advantage product technology power performance chip design edge production premium price incremental upside demand ongoing inventory digestion wei chatgpt strong conviction hpc structural megatrend tsmc commitment blaze revenue profitability capacity utilisation electricity price expensive construction expansion japan compound ability rein cost quarter mitigate challenge worse management chase profit investor strategy client bloombergtim culpan bloomberg opinion columnist technology asia view writer,"[(0, 0.4239104), (6, 0.5727207)]",6
536246,StarBiz,12,19/04/2023,EU lawmakers call for meet to control ‘powerful’ AI,,"LONDON: European Union (EU) lawmakers are urging world leaders to hold a summit to find ways to control the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as ChatGPT, saying they are developing faster than expected.
 The 12 members of the European Parliament (MEPS), working on EU legislation on the technology, called on US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to convene the meeting and said AI firms should be more responsible.
 The statement came weeks after Twitter owner Elon Musk and more than 1,000 technology figures demanded a six-month pause in the development of systems more powerful than Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s latest iteration of ChatGPT, which can mimic humans and create text and images based on prompts.
 That open letter, published in March by the Future of Life Institute (FLI), warned that AI could spread misinformation at an unprecedented rate and that machines could “outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace” humans if left unchecked.
 The MEPS said they disagreed with some of the FLI message’s “more alarmist statements”.
 “We are nevertheless in agreement with the letter’s core message, with the rapid evolution of powerful AI, we see the need for significant political action,” they added.
 The letter urged democratic and “non-democratic” countries to reflect on potential systems of governance and to exercise restraint in their pursuit of very powerful AI.
 A spokesperson for von der Leyen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Responding to the lawmakers’ accusation of alarmism, FLI president Max Tegmark said: “They can think whatever they want as long as they do the right thing.”
 Tegmark told Reuters he was “delighted” by the reply and praised MEPs for taking the lead on AI regulation globally.
 “A key goal of our open letter was really to mainstream the conversation about policymaking and regulation,” he said.
 “It feels like our open letter really struck a nerve. A lot of people had the urge to discuss these things but held back for fear of being seen as paranoid Luddites. The most important thing is that this conversation is happening.”
 Last week, China’s cyberspace regulator unveiled draft measures for managing generative AI services, saying it wants firms to submit security assessments to authorities before they launch their offerings to the public.
 The Biden administration has also been seeking public comments on potential accountability measures for AI systems as questions loom about their impact on national security and education.
 The European Commission proposed the draft rules for an AI Act nearly two years ago, under which AI tools are expected to be classified according to their perceived level of risk, from low to unacceptable.

 “And I think this might be the best path to safety, in the sense that an AI that cares about understanding the universe, it is unlikely to annihilate humans because we are an interesting part of the universe,” he said.

535910,Main,28,18/04/2023,Google CEO warns against rush to deploy AI without oversight,,"MOUNTAIN VIEW (California): Alphabet Inc and Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said that the push to adopt artificial intelligence technology must be well regulated to avoid potential harmful effects.
 Asked in a 60 Minutes interview about what keeps him up at night with regard to AI, Pichai on Sunday said “the urgency to work and deploy it in a beneficial way, but at the same time it can be very harmful if deployed wrongly.”
 Mountain View, California-based Google has been among the leaders in developing and implementing AI across its services. Software like Google Lens and Google Photos rely on the company’s image-recognition systems, while its Google Assistant benefits from natural language processing research that Google has been doing for years. Still, its pace of deploying the technology has been measured, whereas OpenAI’s ChatGPT has opened up a race to move forward with AI tools at a much faster clip. 
 “We don’t have all the answers, and the technology is moving fast,” Pichai said. “So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely.” 
 Google is now playing catch-up to infuse its products with generative AI – software that can create text, images, music or even video based on user prompts. ChatGPT and another OpenAI product, Dall-E, showed the technology’s potential, and countless businesses from Silicon Valley to China’s internet leaders are now getting involved in their own offerings. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt urged global tech companies to develop guardrails, warning that any slowdown in development would “simply benefit China”.

535550,Lifestyle,5,17/04/2023,Will AI catalyse or compromise creativity?,There is concern that artificial intelligence capable  of painting and composing could  dominate the art  world.,"COMPUTERS are painting pictures and composing music, and now they’re writing texts that actually make sense, too.
 The writings are typically the work of ChatGPT, a robot that web users can command to create texts about everything they can possibly imagine. 
 They aren’t too bad, either. You can’t tell they aren’t written by a person, not at first glance, anyway.
 A while back, artificial intelligence (AI) completed Ludwig van Beethoven’s 10th symphony – the work of Dall-E, a program that creates art that was developed by OpenAI of the United States, just like ChatGPT.
 And now anyone with an Internet connection can use a robot to create literature, with the latest development even capable of combining images with text.
 Such generative AI is pretty scary for some people, who fear that art may be under siege from robots.
 Double-edged sword 
 AI “can be a threat, but it can also be an opportunity for the arts, depending on the way it’s used”. That’s the answer from ... ChatGPT itself.
 People from the creative industries are also weighing the changing landscape, including Konrad Zerr, professor of marketing, market research and communications research at Pforzheim, Germany. 
 “I think it’s got enormous potential,” he says.
 Zerr tasked his students with creating a piece of art with AI. They asked ChatGPT to make a poem in the style of German poet Heinrich Heine that describes two people who go to a Christmas market and get into a fight.
 The outcomes were entertaining. “Whether you can see the great poet in our AI-generated poems is doubtful at this point,” was the view of the students themselves.
 The texts are no literary sensation. 
 If you ask ChatGPT to pen a poem about a cat in the style of Franz Kafka, for example, you get an uninspiring work about Kiki, a feline who wakes up one day and notices something strange, in the style of The Metamorphosis.
 But there are other, more impressive examples, such as A Girl With Glowing Earrings, an image created by photographer and “digital creator” Julien van Dieken, using AI. It’s based on Girl With A Pearl Earring, by Dutch master Jan Vermeer, and is currently on display in the Mauritshuis in The Hague.
 That upset some viewers, who asked why the museum had selected that particular work for display. 
 “Because we liked it, quite simply,” a spokesperson says.
 Before that, the agency Tunnel23 created a poem with the aid of AI and algorithms for a competition run by the Brentano Society, which included it in their anthology.
 A danger to art?
 Might robots take over the art world? Not quite, say observers. 
 “Art is always an interactive experience in which people are weighing their responses to reality,” says lecturer Jessica Heesen of Tubingen University, who focuses on ethical and philosophical issues relating to media and the digital world.
 What AI does is focus on patterns and probability, says Heesen. 
 But what it lacks is “the artist as a person, the aura of the original and also the challenge. Who do you address to complain about a work of art?”
 So when asking whether robots are a danger to art, it depends entirely on the notion of art you have, she says. “There will definitely be plenty of works created by AI in the future, making decorative works, say, to put in your kitchen or your living room.”
 But AI can assist in the creation of art, say both Zerr and Heesen. 
 “An artist can frame and contextualise and present the work,” says Heesen. Then AI acts as a helper, says Zerr. “And can also facilitate new art forms.”
 Helper, not replacer
 More of this was seen at Stuttgart’s art museum, in an exhibition called “Shift: AI and a Future Community”.
 On show are not only a talking Chinese doll or actress Marlene Dietrich as a deep fake but also a series of faces, including those of US activist and whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
 The 30 masks were created by US artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg for “Probably Chelsea”. 
 They are “possible portraits” of the whistleblower generated algorithmically by an analysis of her DNA. Dewey-Hagborg is highlighting “just how many ways your DNA can be interpreted as data, and how subjective the act of reading DNA really is”, says a statement on the artist’s website.
 The exhibition aims to investigate how “digital technology is permanently changing the idea of a community in which humans, nature and technology form a cooperative relationship”, according to the museum’s website. 
 AI already “influences, visibly or invisibly, political, economic and social processes” and has “long since arrived at the centre of society”, the site says.The works on display are complex and complicated, showing that AI has a long way to go before it is capable of moving beyond science and technology to create any kind of artistic quality and content.
 Future forecastThe interactions between art and AI are in their early stages. 
 “There’s a general consensus that AI systems are not as advanced as what people are able to create or at least not yet, I should say,” says Ulrike Groos, director of the Stuttgart museum of art. But she says it has potential.
 Zerr outlines his vision of the future: “The creative sector will have to undergo a fundamental change in its processes and capabilities.

535502,Main,23,16/04/2023,AI-proofing your career starts in college,,"THE job market has never offered any guarantees. Mechanisation wiped out once-secure careers in manufacturing. Now artificial intelligence (AI) is coming for a future generation of jobs that had seemed safe, starting with software coding and back-office work. So what can we do about it?
 Despite some hyperbolic fears, there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of technology. It has the potential to bring a better quality of life and more widespread prosperity – eventually. To prosper in this future, workers will need new skills and a different education. And that means rethinking how we approach college and what we want it to provide us.
 Most college degrees pay off not only in higher wages but because they mean graduates are less likely to be unemployed, or will be unemployed for less time. Evolving technology in the late 20th century put a higher premium on more education, leading more people to go to college. The share of the population over age 25 with some post-secondary education doubled between 1980 and 2021 to more than 60%. This increased the supply of graduates and also shrunk the wage premium for college degrees.
 More people going to college also means more bad outcomes: more dropouts and more degrees that don’t pay off. Meanwhile, the price of education has skyrocketed. So no surprise that many people are asking if college is even worth it anymore.
 It is. In fact, with new technology coming our way it will be more valuable than ever.
 If the past is any guide, thriving in an age of technological innovation requires being adaptable and finding different ways to add value. For example, machines that could weave cloth at scale displaced many workers, but master craftsmen who made exceptional-quality goods still had jobs. Other people had to learn how to work a machine. It was not an easy transition; there was a lot of social upheaval and displacement. How we educated the population changed to suit the new economy and it took several decades for workers to adapt. Industrialisation is a big reason why we adopted universal public education.
 Today’s technology arguably poses more challenges because some white-collar jobs will disappear, too. So far, large language models like ChatGPT are good at synthesising existing information to make a decent argument or find a solution to problems. The technology will only get more powerful, though its creative abilities will likely be limited.
 Psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argues that AI is better suited to tasks where risks are well defined and the parameters are stable, like playing chess. It’s less good at dealing with problems where there is more uncertainty. We’ll face more of the latter because data and knowledge from the past tells you little about a fast-changing future. Past data can even be misleading. Gigerenzer thinks human judgment will remain critical, and the value might even be super-charged for people who learn to use the new technology properly.
 Interpersonal skills will also be prized. High-touch human time will be the rarest of commodities. Most importantly, thriving will require constantly learning new things and adapting swiftly because we don’t know how new technology will unfold.
 In short, success will come to those who know how to think and think well. This means students must hone their critical thinking skills as part of their education. 
 Getting that out of a college degree requires two things: different expectations and class selection on the part of students, and for universities and colleges to revamp their approach to curriculums. Even before AI, society struggled to figure out what a post-secondary education should provide. American universities and colleges were originally intended to be liberal arts institutions that aimed to make well-rounded, thoughtful leaders. In contrast to the European model where students specialise early, American students were meant to get a more cursory exposure to many different fields.
 This was reasonable when a small share of the population went to college and it wasn’t too expensive. But as more people pursued higher education and costs rose, the expectation changed. Students wanted a more vocational and career-focused education and were less interested in reading Plato. Meanwhile, colleges and universities stopped doing either job well. Many students struggle to apply their degree to the job market, and the education they get has become less rigorous. One study found little improvement in critical-thinking skills during the first few years among 45% of students.
 It’s understandable people want a clearer path to a career from their degrees, but treating college strictly as vocational education limits students’ skills. Now that critical and creative-thinking skills will be even more essential, American schools should embrace and improve on their original mission that aims to produce well-rounded thinkers.
 There are ways to make any college major more practical or to integrate the humanities, says Preston Cooper, a fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity who has researched the value of degrees. For instance, high-return degrees such as nursing could include more liberal arts classes. More traditional humanities majors like history could include marketing and communications courses. This would impart both hard skills and broader thinking ability, and students would enter the labour force more employable and adaptable.
 In the short run, it will fall on students to challenge themselves and take the initiative to make their college education more AI-proof. They need to seek out the classes that make them think more rigorously, including maths, and probability and statistics. Then balance those with humanities where they’ll learn history and how to write well.  (AI may do more writing for us in the future, but knowing how to write well helps clarify and organise your thoughts.) Students should develop a reading list that allows them to explore the great minds of the past and contemplate how to apply their insights to current times.

533842,StarBiz,11,13/04/2023,Tech heavyweight Alibaba jumps on AI chatbot bandwagon,,"SHANGHAI: Chinese tech heavyweight Alibaba Group Holding Ltd unveiled its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered large language model – Tongyi Qianwen – which it plans to integrate into all of its applicable businesses, joining the chatbot race to offer a potential rival to ChatGPT.
 Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing unit of Alibaba, will offer more enterprises access to Tongyi Qianwen so they can build their own customised large language models.
 “We are at a technological watershed moment driven by generative AI and cloud computing. Businesses across all sectors have started to embrace intelligent transformation to stay ahead of the game,” said Zhang Yong, chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group and CEO of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.
 Zhang made the remarks at the 2023 Alibaba Cloud Summit, which was held on Tuesday in Beijing. The chairman added that Al-large models will be applied in a wide range of sectors, giving a big boost to productivity and profoundly changing people’s lifestyles.
 Alibaba began researching large language models in 2019. 
 It said the ChatGPT-style product will initially be deployed on DingTalk, the company’s workplace messaging app, to summarise meeting notes, create poetry, write emails and draft business proposals. 
 Interest in generative AI has surged since the release of ChatGPT by US-based startup OpenAI in November. 
 A number of leading Chinese tech firms, including Baidu Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd and NetEase have jumped on the AI chatbot bandwagon.
 Alibaba’s unveiling came one day after Chinese AI pioneer SenseTime launched its latest set of large AI models – SenseNova – which cover key capabilities including computer vision, natural language processing and AI-generated content.
 Baidu rolled out its large language model and ChatGPT-like product, dubbed Ernie Bot, last month.
 On Tuesday, China’s cyberspace regulator unveiled draft measures for managing generative AI services.
 Providers will be responsible for the legitimacy of the data used to train generative AI products, and measures should be taken to prevent discrimination when designing algorithms and training data, the Cyberspace Administration of China said.
 The regulator said China supports the innovation and application of AI algorithms and other basic technologies and encourages the use of safe and reliable software, tools and data resources. But the content generated by generative AI should be in line with core socialist values. 
 Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation at Zhejiang University, said the process of training large AI models necessitates higher requirements for computing capacity, and Alibaba has accumulated some advantages in AI infrastructure, with cloud computing being a key segment driving its revenue growth. — China Daily/ANN",shanghai chinese tech unveiled artificial intelligence language model tongyi qianwen plan applicable business chatbot race potential rival chatgpt alibaba cloud cloud unit alibaba offer access tongyi qianwen build language model technological moment generative cloud business sector embrace intelligent transformation stay game zhang chairman ceo ceo alibaba cloud intelligence zhang remark cloud summit tuesday beijing chairman model wide range sector productivity people lifestyle language model style product dingtalk company workplace app summarise meeting note poetry write draft business proposal release chatgpt startup openai november chinese tech firm baidu tencent holding netease chatbot bandwagon unveiling day chinese pioneer sensetime model cover key capability computer vision natural language processing content baidu language model chatgpt product ernie bot month tuesday cyberspace regulator draft measure generative service provider responsible legitimacy data generative product prevent discrimination algorithm training data cyberspace administration china regulator china innovation application algorithm basic technology safe reliable software tool data resource content generative core socialist value director digital economy financial innovation zhejiang university process training model requirement capacity advantage infrastructure cloud key segment revenue growth daily ann,"[(2, 0.994847)]",2
534236,Main,11,13/04/2023,Human touch still valued above AI at most workplaces,,"PETALING JAYA: Despite the versatility of ChatGPT, a tool powered by artificial intelligence (AI), business leaders say that the human touch is still highly valued in many workplaces for day-to-day operations.
 Although the use of AI in retail will increase, customers still prefer interacting with humans, said Malaysia Retailers Association president Datuk Andrew Lim.
 “AI is a computer programme found in devices that can help deal with routine work, especially in reminding people of their ­schedule and tasks and providing assistance.
 “(But) In Malaysia, people still prefer dealing with humans because they want to be able to talk to someone.
 “In the retail business, when customers give feedback or make complaints, AI cannot deal with the emotions being conveyed. Sure, certain words can trigger certain responses, but how a human would react will be different.
 “A machine answering your query does not generate the same level of satisfaction,” he told The Star in response to businesses’ increasing adoption of AI to manage daily operations.
 Talent Corporation Malaysia Bhd (TalentCorp) group chief ­executive officer Thomas Mathew said the human touch is still vital when it comes to creative writing, the visuals and the feel of a marketing campaign.
 “While there is no hard policy on the use of AI tools at TalentCorp, we encourage continuous learning and experimenting so that our colleagues can keep up with new technologies, especially if it’s related to their work.
 “Currently the most popular AI tools are related to communications and production, so we do use them to help us generate ideas. It’s useful, especially during crunch times when we have hard deadlines to meet.
 “However, I’d caution against relying on them 100% because while AI is good at processing and analysing data, there are still glaring limitations, especially for creativity and empathy,” Mathew said, adding that TalentCorp’s existing human resources and information technology guidelines on ­ethics, plagiarism and security phishing attempts are sufficient for now.
 The Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) president Datin Christina Toh said the use of ChatGPT is merely a complementary element to the hospitality industry, which can help provide a more straightforward response.
 She said the human element remains a vital tool in running the industry, where connection with the customer is important.
 “AI usage for concierge services to provide information or bookings is one way that helps support the industry.
 “Nevertheless, the manner in which humans interact with one another can help capture other emotions, such as trust and satisfaction.
 “We cannot be 100% dependent on technology – it should be demarcated because customers want to be heard, and talking to a machine while pressing a button may not have the desired outcome,” she said.

533430,Lifestyle,4,12/04/2023,Fashion is embracing artificial intelligence,,"When it comes to technology, the fashion industry is often one step ahead. This has been seen with the metaverse, and now with the advent of artificial intelligence. 
 While the industry’s major players have yet to explore all the many features of ChatGPT, some are already using AI to showcase new products or create futuristic magazine covers.
 The future of fashion is slowly but surely taking shape. Most ready-to-wear brands are already committed to making fashion more sustainable, and they have not overlooked new technologies and their infinite possibilities. This was seen at the beginning of March, during the Coperni Autumn/Winter 2024 fashion show, where models paraded alongside robot dogs. 
 The runway first serves as a reminder that the fashion and luxury industries have not given up on the metaverse as their new playground and continue to explore its many features. 
 This is evidenced by the second Metaverse Fashion Week held at the end of March, which although it has not yet found its audience, keeps on innovating and improving to become a (virtual) reality in the fashion world.
 Digital models
 When not exploring these parallel worlds, the fashion industry seems to be taking an interest in artificial intelligence. 
 The ChatGPT conversational AI is as innovative as it is futuristic, and it seems poised to change our daily realities – as well as those of many industries. In fashion, it could become a go-to for generating social media content, product descriptions, or even become a virtual personal shopper, but that’s not all. 
 More broadly, artificial intelligence, in various forms, could soon overshadow human models with a new generation of generated images that look like something straight from the future.
 Vogue Singapore is pioneering this concept by featuring no less than three fully AI-created models in its March issue – Aadhya, Melur and Faye. 
 All were generated in collaboration with the Mumbai-based artist and creative director Varun Gupta. 
 If AI-generated pictures seem to have been multiplying lately on social networks – with some people now questioning the origin of each picture published – this is the first cover of a women’s magazine to be made in this way. 
 The American magazine Cosmopolitan proposed a similar cover in June 2022, but featuring an astronaut rather than a model. And while it may be the first, it certainly won’t be the last one.
 AI to increase inclusivity?
 Recently Levi’s announced a partnership with the digital fashion studio Lalaland.ia, with the aim of creating custom models generated by AI. 
 While the goal is obviously not to replace human models, the ready-to-wear brand initially announced that this would be a means to increase “the number and diversity” of Levi’s models “in a sustainable way”.
  An idea that did not go unnoticed, and which even raised eyebrows, with some social media users reproaching the brand for using the argument of inclusivity to use AI models when the same thing could just as well be achieved with human models.
 Levi’s soon responded to the criticism: “Our recent announcement of a partnership with Lalaland.ai did not properly represent certain aspects of the program. For that, we take responsibility. We do not see this pilot as a means to advance diversity or as a substitute for the real action that must be taken to deliver on our diversity, equity and inclusion goals and it should not have been portrayed as such. At Levi Strauss & Co., we’re committed to creating a workplace, a business and a marketplace where people from all backgrounds feel confident that they will be seen, their voices will be heard and their contributions welcomed,” the brand said in a statement.
 This pilot project, which should see the light of day later this year, will see the American brand present its products sold online on futuristic models generated entirely by AI. 
 A real revolution which, although Levi’s doesn’t state it overtly, would (also) allow the brand to save on the cost of using real models and photo shoots, not to mention the time and effort that organising real-world shoots requires throughout the year. 
 If the exploration of artificial intelligence is still in its early days, there’s no doubt that the fashion industry will soon seize on this new technological playground, which promises both creative and lucrative possibilities. – AFP Relaxnews",technology fashion industry step metaverse advent artificial intelligence industry major player feature showcase product futuristic magazine future fashion ready brand committed fashion sustainable overlooked technology infinite possibility coperni autumn winter fashion model robot dog serf fashion luxury industry playground continue explore feature metaverse fashion week march audience virtual reality fashion digital model parallel world fashion industry artificial intelligence conversational innovative futuristic change daily reality industry fashion social medium content product description virtual personal shopper artificial intelligence form human model generation image straight future vogue singapore concept model issue aadhya collaboration mumbai artist creative director varun gupta picture social network people origin picture woman magazine american magazine cosmopolitan cover june astronaut model increase inclusivity levi partnership digital fashion studio lalaland aim custom model goal human model ready wear brand increase diversity levi model sustainable idea eyebrow social medium user brand argument inclusivity model human model criticism announcement partnership lalaland represent aspect program responsibility pilot advance diversity substitute real action deliver diversity equity inclusion goal levi strauss workplace business marketplace people feel confident voice contribution brand statement pilot project light day american brand product online futuristic model real revolution brand save cost real model shoot mention time effort real shoot exploration artificial intelligence day fashion industry technological playground promise creative lucrative possibility relaxnews,"[(2, 0.4135446), (5, 0.5829875)]",5
533704,Main,16,12/04/2023,Close watch on new AI products,Pre-release security checks required under sweeping draft law,"NEW artificial intelligence (AI) products developed in China will have to undergo a security assessment before being released and must reflect “core socialist values”, a sweeping new draft law by the country’s Internet regulator showed.
 The fresh regulations come as a flurry of Chinese companies rush to develop AI services that can mimic human speech since San Francisco-based OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November, sparking a gold rush in the market.
 Rapid advancements in AI have stoked global alarm over the technology’s potential for disinformation and misuse, with deepfake images and people shown mouthing things they never said.
 “Before providing services to the public that use generative AI products, a security assessment shall be applied for through national Internet regulatory departments,” the draft law, released by the Cyberspace Administration of China yesterday, reads.
 The draft law – dubbed “Administrative Measures for Generative Artificial Intelligence Services” – aims to ensure “the healthy development and standardised application of generative AI technology”, it read.
 AI-generated content, it continued, needs to “reflect core socialist values, and must not contain content on subversion of state power”.
 It must also not contain, among other things, “terrorist or extremist propaganda”, “ethnic hatred” or “other content that may disrupt economic and social order”.
 The Cyberspace Administration of China said it was seeking public input on the contents of the new regulations.
 “The new CAC draft document is one of the strictest measures for generative AI so far,” Andy Chun, adjunct professor at City Uni­versity of Hong Kong, said.
 Companies submitting security assessments will need to “be very careful to ensure each data source used for AI learning must be within guidelines, accurate, unbiased, and not infringe on IP rights of others,” he said.
 “Ensuring accuracy is hard. No generative AI system to date can do that.”
 The regulatory crackdown comes as China’s tech giants ramp up their efforts in the closely- watched sector.
 Alibaba’s cloud computing unit yesterday unveiled its own product called Tongyi Qianwen, which is expected to be rolled out across the tech giant’s office workplace communications software and household appliances.
 CEO Daniel Zhang said the software came in a “technological watershed moment driven by generative AI and cloud computing”.
 And Baidu – which operates the country’s leading search engine – released its own “Ernie Bot” AI chat product last month.
 But investors were unimpressed by the bot’s display of linguistic and maths skills at an unveiling, sending shares falling by as much as 10%.
 ChatGPT is unavailable in China, but the American software is also gaining a base of Chinese users who use virtual private networks to get around the ban, deploying it to write essays and cram for exams.
 A 24-year-old Shanghai blogger caused a stir this month when he used AI technology to “resurrect” his dead grandmother, producing lifelike imagery of his interactions with the deceased relative.
 Beijing has announced ambitious plans to become a global leader in the field of AI by 2030, and consultancy group McKinsey estimates the sector could add about US$600bil (RM2.6 trillion) every year to China’s gross domestic product by then.
 But it has also warned that deepfakes present a “danger to national security and social stability”.
 Beijing in January enforced new rules that would require businesses offering deepfake services to obtain the real identities of their users. They also require deepfake content to be appropriately tagged to avoid “any confusion”. — AFP",artificial intelligence product china undergo security assessment reflect core socialist value draft law country internet regulator fresh regulation chinese company service mimic human speech san francisco chatgpt november gold rush market rapid advancement global alarm technology potential disinformation misuse deepfake image people service public generative product security assessment national internet regulatory department draft law cyberspace administration china yesterday draft law administrative measure artificial intelligence service healthy development application generative technology read content continued reflect core socialist value content subversion power terrorist extremist propaganda ethnic content disrupt economic social cyberspace administration china public input content regulation draft document strictest measure generative andy chun adjunct professor city uni versity kong company security assessment careful data source guideline unbiased infringe right accuracy hard generative system regulatory crackdown china tech giant effort sector alibaba unit yesterday product tech giant office workplace communication software household appliance daniel zhang software technological moment generative cloud baidu operates country search engine ernie bot product month investor bot display linguistic math skill share chatgpt unavailable china american software base chinese user virtual private network write essay exam blogger stir month technology resurrect dead grandmother lifelike imagery interaction relative beijing ambitious plan global leader field consultancy mckinsey estimate sector bil china gross domestic product deepfakes national security social stability january rule business deepfake service real identity user content avoid confusion afp,"[(2, 0.9959022)]",2
532722,Lifestyle,6,10/04/2023,No pausing artificial intelligence,,"CALLS to pause the development of artificial intelligence (AI) will not “solve the challenges” ahead, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said in his first public comments since an open letter sparked a debate about the future of the technology.
 The technologist-turned- philanthropist said it would be better to focus on how best to use the developments in AI, as it was hard to understand how a pause could work globally.
 His interview comes after an open letter – published recently and co-signed by Elon Musk and more than 1,000 AI experts – demanded an urgent pause in the development of systems “more powerful” than Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s new GPT-4, which can hold human-like conversations, compose songs, and summarise lengthy documents.
 The experts, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, said in the letter that the potential risks and benefits to society need to be assessed.
 “I don’t think asking one particular group to pause solves the challenges,” Gates said.
 “Clearly, there are huge benefits to these things ... what we need to do is identify the tricky areas.”
 Microsoft has sought to outpace peers through multi- billion-dollar investments in ChatGPT owner OpenAI.
 While currently focused full-time on the philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates has been a bullish supporter of AI and has called it as revolutionary as the Internet or mobile phones.
 In a blog post titled “The Age Of AI Has Begun”, which was published and dated March 21, a day before the open letter, he said he believes AI should be used to help reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.
 He also said in the interview that the details of any pause would be complicated to enforce.
 “I don’t really understand who they’re saying could stop, would every country in the world agree to stop, and why to stop,” he said. “But there are a lot of different opinions in this area.” – Reuters",call development artificial intelligence solve challenge microsoft founder bill public comment letter debate future technology technologist philanthropist focus development hard understand pause interview letter elon musk expert urgent pause development system powerful microsoft openai gpt human conversation song lengthy document expert apple founder wozniak letter potential risk benefit society pause gate huge benefit tricky microsoft outpace peer dollar investment owner openai time philanthropic bill melinda foundation gate bullish supporter revolutionary internet mobile phone post age march day letter worst inequity interview detail enforce understand country lot opinion reuters,"[(2, 0.98986894)]",2
532356,Lifestyle,7,09/04/2023,Scientists are making lots of AI  breakthroughs – but should they?,,"IN my column in February about artificial intelligence (AI) and ChatGPT, I compared it to autocorrect on steroids (The Star, Feb 26; at bit.ly/star_kill). 
 Well, that’s changed.
 What I was talking about was ChatGPT-3; developer OpenAI has now released ChatGPT-4, which it promises has better problem-solving abilities and advanced reading capabilities. Indeed, I’ve seen posts on Twitter where users typed their query in backwards and GPT-4 still answered the question. Testers are saying that the work this new and improved AI generates is on par with human work. Not better. Not genius level. Not yet.
 From all accounts GPT-4 is orders of magnitude better than GPT-3. It’s April 2023. GPT-3 was released in November 2022. Six months later and we’re getting something that is much more advanced. In fact, some experts are saying that GPT-4 has “sparks of artificial general intelligence”, or AGI, which means the AI can operate at human or above human intelligence level. When people talk about doomsday AI, it’s this leap to AGI they mean.
 This led to the Future of Life Institute, led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Max Tegmark, to release a letter calling for an AI moratorium. Specially, a six-month pause in developing these experimental AI models.
 Why the pause? To slow things down. Take a breath. Catch up a on what we’re doing here.
 Those in favour of the pause include tech mogul Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, who both signed the letter, along with hundreds of other technology and thought leaders.
 What would a six-month break do? Maybe allow those creating the AIs to understand them a bit better? Surely the developers understand the AI, you say? No, not necessarily.
 For instance, ChatGPT is famous for giving succinct answers – but it’s also notorious for making stuff up. Once, I used a jailbreak – something that helps the AI circumvent its programming by roleplaying – and it revealed several different dates for a stock market crash. When I asked why the different dates, GPT-3 said, “It’s all part of the fun of roleplaying”.
 Asking for investment advice, medical advice, and other such life advice is on the list of things ChatGPT shouldn’t answer. The OpenAI website boasts that GPT-4 is 84% less likely to “respond to requests for disallowed content”. That’s great but why isn’t it 100%? Why is ChatGPT saying it’s just having fun making stuff up when I ask it questions?
 According to an article in The Guardian, when an author of the “sparks of artificial general intelligence” paper was asked if AI is implementing its own goals when providing answers the presumably go against its programming, the answer was “we have no idea”. 
 And that’s just it. The people developing this don’t really know how their creation works. That’s a tad scary.
 But at this point, even if GPT-4 becomes Skynet (the AI that dooms humanity in the Terminator movie series) there isn’t much it could do to us. As experts have noted, this thing lives on a data server and data servers can be destroyed, not to mention they need constant maintenance. There is no robot factory for GPT-4 to take over and make an army from – unless it takes over the Roomba factory and spits out Terminator vacuum cleaners. So in that sense, we’re pretty safe, right? Maybe.
 Opponents of the six-month pause argue that people are focusing on the unlimited downside of the AI. But as AI has definitive world-altering abilities, putting off development could lead to a longer pause that delays breakthroughs. Breakthroughs that could happen in every industry. 
 What if it is possible for the millions of factors that make you you, to be analysed and a comprehensive health plan built only for you?  AI can do that. And that’s just one example. AI will literally be in everything. Making everything easier. Better.
 But can we be sure AI won’t turn into Skynet? No, we can’t. Especially if we don’t even know why and how it’s doing what it’s doing right now, in these very early stages of AGI.
 Once again I find myself thinking of Jeff Goldblum’s character in the Jurassic Park movies when he finds out dinosaurs have been cloned and he says, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should”.
 With AI we definitely should, but it’s how we do it responsibly that is the hard part.

532464,Main,5,09/04/2023,Companies told to set AI policy,Controls needed with increased  use of ChatGPT among employees,"PETALING JAYA: Companies should put into place effective policies on the use of the Artificial Intelligence-powered tool ChatGPT in the workplace as its use increa­ses among employees, say human resour­ces and IT experts.
 These policies should cover issues such as confidentiality, regulation and quality, they said.
 Describing ChatGPT as the latest disruptive technology after the Internet and the smartphone, Universiti Sains Malaysia cybersecurity researcher Assoc Prof Dr Selvakumar Manickam said it could be a powerful tool for companies for effective communications, marketing, and planning.
 “As such, policies on effective use of ChatGPT should be encouraged in companies. It helps in data gathering, analysing and providing decision support results. 
 “Of course, these policies should also cover issues such as confidentiality, regulation and quality,” he said.
 However, ChatGPT could be leveraged by cybercriminals to carry out new forms of phishing attacks, using it to create emails or messages that could bypass email security scanners, Selvakumar added.
 This is because ChatGPT can accelerate the learning process for anyone aspiring to be a hacker.
 “From its usage in companies, employees may inadvertently feed data and information into ChatGPT, which is then incorporated as part of ChatGPT’s knowledge corpus, potentially exposing a company’s sensitive data to other users,” he said.
 Legal practitioner Chia Swee Yik said there was always a need for some sort of IT or Internet policy that served as a control.
 “This may be done by amending an existing policy, introducing a new one or making a statement to notify employees about it.
 “I think employees are already using ChatGPT to aid their work, especially those in content production or generation duties.
 “So, this certainly comes with risks to employers such as confidentiality, accuracy of information, and copyright, just to name a few,” said Chia, adding that controls via such policies should be put in place, clearly setting out what the expectations around its use would be.
 In terms of reprimanding employees who misuse ChatGPT, he said that it would depend on the policy, but disciplinary action should be consistent with employers’ disciplinary policy and commensurate with the severity of offences.
 Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) president Datuk Dr Syed Hussain Syed Husman said stakeholders had just got to hear about ChatGPT and what it could do.
 As such, he said it was still too early to draw up any guidelines or policies until they understand it in more detail.
 “Yes, if it’s going to be mainstream. Then like all things, policies must be put in place for governance – it is the right thing to do.
 “Like all new technology or system or communication language, we have to see its advantages and limit its negative implications,” he said, adding that at present, stakeholders had not brought up the issue.
 The guidelines for ChatGPT would depend on the kind of work or industry it was being used for, said Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) treasurer-general Datuk Koong Lin Loong.
 This was because the nature of the work could be technical or require certain things, and as the variables differ, the policies should suit it accordingly, he added.
 “For example, a lot of people use Google, but there is no specific guide to it. Same with social media. But only when things happen, can we formulate what can be done or not be done.
 “You can have a pen knife, which is used to open letters and boxes, but if it is misused, the knife can be dangerous. So how we use it is important,” said Koong.

532154,Main,22,08/04/2023,Still waiting for the AI productivity boom,"Artificial intelligence may change everything, but probably not too quickly","“Artificial intelligence (AI) is already having a significant impact on the economy, and its influence is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. ... Overall, the effects of AI on the economy will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of technological advancement, government policies and the ability of workers to adapt to new technologies.”
 OK, who said that? Nobody, unless we’re ready to start calling large language models people. What I did was ask ChatGPT to describe the economic effects of artificial intelligence; it went on at length, so that was an excerpt.
 I think many of us who’ve played around with large language models – which are being widely discussed under the rubric of AI (although there’s an almost metaphysical debate over whether we should call it intelligence) – have been shocked by how much they now manage to sound like people. And it’s a good bet that they or their descendants will eventually take over a significant number of tasks that are currently done by humans.
 Like previous leaps in technology, this will make the economy more productive but will also probably hurt some workers whose skills have been devalued.
 Although the term “Luddite” is often used to describe someone who is simply prejudiced against new technology, the original Luddites were skilled artisans who suffered real economic harm from the introduction of power looms and knitting frames.
 But this time around, how large will these effects be? And how quickly will they come about?
 On the first question, the answer is that nobody really knows. Predictions about the economic impact of technology are notoriously unreliable. On the second, history suggests that large economic effects from AI will take longer to materialise than many people seem to expect.
 Consider the effects of previous advances in computing. Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel – which introduced the microprocessor in 1971 – died last month. He was famous for his prediction that the number of transistors on a computer chip would double every two years – a prediction that proved stunningly accurate for half a century.
 The consequences of Moore’s Law are all around us, most obviously in the powerful computers, aka smartphones, that almost everyone carries around these days.
 For a long time, however, the economic payoff from this awesome rise in computing power was surprisingly elusive.
 Why did a huge, prolonged surge in computing power take so long to pay off for the economy?
 In 1990, economic historian Paul David published one of my favourite economics papers of all time, The Dynamo and the Computer. It drew a parallel between the effects of information technology and those of an earlier tech revolution, the electrification of industry.
 As David noted, electric motors became widely available in the 1890s. But having a technology isn’t enough. You also have to figure out what to do with it.
 To take full advantage of electrification, manufacturers had to rethink the design of factories. Pre-electric factories were multi-storey buildings with cramped working spaces, because that was necessary to make efficient use of a steam engine in the basement driving the machines through a system of shafts, gears and pulleys.
 It took time to realise that having each machine driven by its own motor made it possible to have sprawling one-storey factories with wide aisles allowing easy movement of materials, not to mention assembly lines. 
 As a result, the big productivity gains from electrification didn’t materialise until after World War I.
 Sure enough, as David, in effect, predicted, the economic payoff from information technology finally kicked in during the 1990s, as filing cabinets and secretaries taking dictation finally gave way to cubicle farms. (What? You think technological progress is always glamorous?) The lag in this economic payoff even ended up being similar in length to the lagged payoff from electrification.
 But this history still presents a few puzzles. One is why the first productivity boom from information technology (there may be another one coming, if the enthusiasm about chatbots is justified) was so short-lived; basically it lasted only around a decade.
 And even while it lasted, productivity growth during the IT boom was no higher than it was during the generation-long boom after World War II, which was notable in the fact that it didn’t seem to be driven by any radically new technology.
 In 1969, celebrated management consultant Peter Drucker published The Age of Discontinuity, a book that correctly predicted major changes in the economy’s structure, yet the book’s title implies – correctly, I think – that the preceding period of extraordinary economic growth was actually an age of continuity, an era during which the basic outlines of the economy didn’t change much, even as America became vastly richer.
 Or to put it another way, the great boom from the 1940s to around 1970 seems to have been largely based on the use of technologies, like the internal combustion engine, that had been around for decades – which should make us even more sceptical about trying to use recent technological developments to predict economic growth.
 That’s not to say that AI won’t have huge economic impacts. But history suggests that they won’t come quickly. ChatGPT and whatever follows are probably an economic story for the 2030s, not for the next few years.
 Which doesn’t mean that we should ignore the implications of a possible AI-driven boom. Large language models in their current form shouldn’t affect economic projections for next year and probably shouldn’t have a large effect on economic projections for the next decade. But the longer-run prospects for economic growth do look better now than they did before computers began doing such good imitations of people. — NYT",artificial intelligence impact economy influence grow effect economy variety factor rate technological advancement government policy ability worker adapt technology ready language model people economic effect artificial intelligence length language model rubric metaphysical debate call intelligence manage sound people descendant task human previous leap technology economy productive hurt worker skill devalued term luddite technology original luddite artisan real economic harm introduction power frame time effect prediction economic impact technology unreliable history economic effect materialise people effect previous advance gordon moore founder intel died month famous prediction transistor computer chip double prediction accurate half century consequence law powerful computer smartphones day time economic payoff awesome rise power elusive huge surge power pay economy economic historian paul david favourite economics paper time dynamo computer parallel effect technology tech revolution electrification industry electric motor technology figure advantage electrification manufacturer design factory electric factory storey building space efficient steam engine basement machine system shaft gear pulley time realise machine motor storey factory wide aisle easy movement material mention line productivity gain war david economic payoff technology cabinet secretary cubicle farm technological progress glamorous lag economic payoff length payoff electrification history puzzle productivity boom technology enthusiasm chatbots short decade productivity growth boom generation boom war notable technology management consultant peter drucker age discontinuity book major economy structure book title implies period extraordinary economic growth age continuity era basic outline economy change richer boom technology internal combustion engine decade sceptical technological development economic growth huge economic impact history economic story ignore implication boom language model current form affect economic projection economic projection decade prospect economic growth computer imitation people,"[(1, 0.60994196), (2, 0.3871503)]",1
531902,Main,21,07/04/2023,Outraged artists fight AI copycats,,"SAN FRANCISCO: Artists outraged by artificial intelligence that copies in seconds the styles they have sacrificed years to develop are waging battle online and in court.
 Fury erupted in the art community last year with the release of generative artificial intelligence (AI) programmes that can convincingly carry out commands such as drawing a dog like cartoonist Sarah Andersen would, or a nymph the way illustrator Karla Ortiz might do.
 Such style-swiping AI works are cranked out without the original artist’s consent, credit or compensation – the three Cs at the heart of a fight to change all that.
 In January, artists including Andersen and Ortiz filed a class-action lawsuit against DreamUp, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, three image-generating AI models programmed with art found  online. 
 Andersen said she felt “violated” when first she saw an AI drawing that copied the style of her Fangs comic book work. 
 She fired off an indignant reaction on Twitter; it went viral, and other incensed artists reached out to her with stories of their own. 
 Backers of the suit hope to establish legal precedent governing generative AI models that copy artists’ styles. Artists want AI creators to be required to secure permission for works used in training software, with an option to remove it. They also want suitable compensation.
 “There is room for a conversation about what that would look like,” said Ortiz.
 Compensation could take the form of a licensing model, she mused, and would need to be appropriate. It would be wrong for artists to “get a couple of cents while the company gets millions” of dollars, added Ortiz, whose resume includes working for Marvel Studios.
 On social networks, artists are sharing tales of jobs being lost to generative AI. 
 The suit notes that a video-game designer named Jason Allen won a Colorado State Fair competition last year with art created using Midjourney.
 “Art is dead, dude. It’s over. AI won. Humans lost,” Allen was quoted as telling The New York Times.
 The Mauritshuis Museum in the Netherlands sparked controversy by displaying an AI-generated image inspired by Vermeer’s “Girl With a Pearl Earring”.
 The San Francisco Ballet, meanwhile, caused a stir by using Midjourney to generate illustrations used in promotional material for Nutcracker performances.
 “It’s sort of a natural consequence of something being easy, cheap and accessible. Of course they are going to use that option, even if it is unethical,” Andersen said.
 AI companies named in the lawsuit did not respond to requests for comment. 
 Stability AI founder and chief executive Emad Mostaque has portrayed generative software as a “tool” that can tend to “mundane image output” and provide new ways “of ideating for artists”.
 Mostaque contends that it will allow more people to become artists. 
 Critics disagree. When a person prompts software to draw in the style of a master, they say, it does not make that person an artist. 
 Mostaque has said that if people choose to use generative AI unethically or to break the law, “that’s their problem”.
 Companies defending themselves from artists’ copyright claims are likely to claim “fair use,” an exception sometimes allowed when a new spin is put on a creation or when it is only briefly excerpted. -— New York Times",san francisco artist artificial intelligence copy style waging battle online court fury art community release generative artificial intelligence programme command dog cartoonist sarah nymph illustrator karla ortiz style original artist consent credit compensation heart fight change january artist andersen ortiz class action lawsuit dreamup midjourney stable diffusion image model online andersen copied style fang comic book indignant reaction twitter viral incensed artist story backer legal precedent generative model artist style artist creator secure permission training software option suitable compensation conversation compensation form model wrong artist cent company million dollar ortiz resume marvel studio social network artist tale job generative suit video game designer jason colorado fair competition art midjourney art dead dude human telling york time museum netherlands controversy image vermeer girl pearl san francisco ballet stir midjourney generate illustration promotional material nutcracker natural consequence easy cheap accessible option unethical andersen company lawsuit respond request stability founder chief executive emad mostaque generative software tool mundane image output artist mostaque people artist critic person prompt software draw style master person artist mostaque people generative break law company artist claim fair exception spin creation york time,"[(2, 0.68165773), (3, 0.14796087), (6, 0.16711451)]",2
531358,StarBiz,14,06/04/2023,"Biden highlights AI dangers, tech firms to ‘make sure’ of safety",,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden says it remains to be seen whether artificial intelligence (AI) is dangerous, but underscored that technology companies had a responsibility to ensure their products were safe before making them public.
 Biden told science and technology advisers that AI could help address disease and climate change, but it was also important to address potential risks to society, national security and the economy.
 “Tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public,” he said at the start of a meeting of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.
 When asked if AI was dangerous, he said: “It remains to be seen. It could be.”
 He spoke on the same day his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, surrendered in New York over charges stemming from a probe into hush money paid to a porn star.
 Biden declined to comment on Trump’s legal woes, and Democratic strategists said his focus on governing will create a politically advantageous split screen of sorts as his former rival, a Republican, deals with his legal challenges.
 The president said social media had already illustrated the harm that powerful technologies can do without the right safeguards.
 “Absent safeguards, we see the impact on mental health, self-image, and feelings of hopelessness, especially among young people,” Biden said.
 He reiterated a call for Congress to pass bipartisan privacy legislation to put limits on personal data that technology companies collect, ban advertising targeted at children, and prioritise health and safety in product development.
 Shares of companies that employ AI dropped sharply before Biden’s meeting, although the broader market was also selling off on Tuesday.
 Shares of AI software company C3.ai Inc were down 24%, more than halving a four-session winning streak of nearly 40% through Monday.

531340,StarBiz,15,06/04/2023,Google says its AI supercomputer is faster than Nvidia A100 chip,,"NEW YORK: Alphabet Inc’s Google released new details about the supercomputers it uses to train its artificial intelligence models, saying the systems are both faster and more power-efficient than comparable systems from Nvidia Corp.
 Google has designed its own custom chip called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). It uses those chips for more than 90% of the company’s work on artificial intelligence training, the process of feeding data through models to make them useful for tasks such as responding to queries with human-like text or generating images.
 The Google TPU is now in its fourth generation. Google on Tuesday published a scientific paper detailing how it has strung more than 4,000 of the chips together into a supercomputer using its own custom-developed optical switches to help connect individual machines.
 Improving these connections has become a key point of competition among companies that build AI supercomputers because so-called large language models that power technologies like Google’s Bard or OpenAI’s ChatGPT have exploded in size, meaning they are too large to store on a single chip.
 The models must instead be split across thousands of chips, which must then work together for weeks or more to train the model. Google’s PaLM model, its largest publicly disclosed language model to date, was trained by splitting it across two of the 4,000-chip supercomputers over 50 days.
 Google said its supercomputers make it easy to reconfigure connections between chips on the fly, helping to avoid problems and tweak for performance gains.
 “Circuit switching makes it easy to route around failed components,” Google fellow Norm Jouppi and Google distinguished engineer David Patterson wrote in a blog post about the system.
 While Google is only now releasing details about its supercomputer, it has been online inside the company since 2020 in a data centre in Mayes County, Oklahoma.
 Google said that startup Midjourney used the system to train its model, which generates fresh images after being fed a few words of text. — Reuters",york alphabet google detail supercomputer artificial intelligence model system power efficient comparable system google custom chip tensor processing unit tpu chip company artificial intelligence training process data model task query human image tpu fourth generation google tuesday scientific paper strung chip supercomputer custom optical switch individual machine connection key competition company supercomputer language model power technology openai chatgpt size meaning store single chip model thousand chip week model google palm model largest language model chip supercomputer day supercomputer easy reconfigure connection chip avoid tweak performance gain easy route component fellow norm jouppi google engineer david patterson blog post system google detail inside company data mayes oklahoma google startup midjourney system model generates fresh image text reuters,"[(2, 0.5088055), (5, 0.48478517)]",2
530494,Lifestyle,9,04/04/2023,Hitting the road with AI,Can you use ChatGPT to  plan travel? It’s hilarious and can actually work.,"TRAVEL planning correlates with happiness – so say a million articles, researchers and well-published scientific papers. So why is it so danged overwhelming?
 Maybe it’s because we think we’re looking for something unique when in reality we don’t want to venture that far off the beaten path. Or because the Internet seems so full of ideas, yet always points us to the same over-Instagrammed cliches. (It’s a real paradox.) Or because our dreams are bigger than our budgets, given current headlines. 
 Tired of seeing the flickering cursor in a Google search bar-and wondering what it was that I was actually searching for-I decided to enlist generative artificial intelligence. 
 After all, Chat GPT-4, the latest version of Open AI’s chatbot, promises to iterate creatively with users in order to solve complex problems. Here’s how it tackled a variety of travel planning situations-for two alter egos I created to test the technology-and how it might help you, too. The answer is, as with anything, a truly mixed bag.
 Survey: Are you taking more blended work and leisure trips this year? Which airport in the world do you think is the worst? Take our MLIV Pulse survey. It’s short and anonymous.
 The Success Story
 The mission: A relaxing, family-friendly trip with two (very) young kids
 Score: 9/10
 Most glossy hotels would rather tell you how they cater to honeymooners than to toddlers, despite the fact that millennials - their once-coveted demographic - now globe-trot lavishly with their rugrats. I threw ChatGPT a curve ball by asking it not only to find me five-star Caribbean resorts with kids clubs but specifically ones that would accept my four-year-old; to my frustration, most kids clubs start at age five.
 Its first suggestion was a perfect bull’s-eye: The Four Seasons Nevis actually lets kids as young as three participate in its Kids for All Seasons programming. (Many of those activities are complimentary, in a further surprise!) When I dug around the resort’s website to verify ChatGPT’s suggestion, I could see evidence of a pink-hued playground on the sand (that my daughter would love) and a beautiful arts and crafts station at the kids club. Sold.
 It also suggested Eden Roc Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic, where I actually tried to plan our spring break trip this year. We scratched it because the flights from New York were astonishingly expensive; the resort itself is an amenity-packed dream for families with kids, and its Koko Kid’s Club indeed takes four-year-olds.
 Less on the nose were suggestions for all-inclusive resorts Beaches Turks & Caicos and Grand Velas Riviera Maya. They scratch the kid-friendly itch beautifully, but aren’t in the same threshold for luxury. On another query, ChatGPT recommended great hotels such as Malliouhana in Anguilla, where my kiddo isn’t actually old enough to partake in the 5-and-up Mini-Explorers’ Programme. (Disclaimer: None of this information is easy to find online;  I find myself digging for it in the least-seen corners of hotel websites. It’s also possible that ChatGPT was simply referring to outdated, pre-2021 information; that’s one thing that OpenAI warns about explicitly when you begin using it.)
 The bot also did surprisingly well when I gave it even fewer parameters. In a fresh query, I asked it to brainstorm a relaxing vacation that I could take with my one-year-old, ideally within two time zones of home. 
 Since it didn’t know I live in New York, the second half of my question threw it for a bit of a loop-prompting suggestions of Vancouver! San Diego! ChatGPT is human-like in the way it phrases responses, but it doesn’t ask follow-up questions. It’s best to be specific. Even so, its suggestions included Costa Rica and its rain forest reserve near the Arenal volcano, where I happen to have a future trip in the works.
 ChatGPT didn’t quite drill down to the hotel I’m looking at (Nayara Tented Camp) but it came close by suggesting I go to the Four Seasons Resort Costa Rica at Peninsula Papagayo, where we could try “a range of family-friendly amenities and activities, including a kids’ club, family pool, and a variety of outdoor adventures such as zip-lining and surfing lessons.” (Did it remember I also have a four-year-old and a taste for luxury?) The suggestion was a lucky one, I think: Papagayo happens to be two time zones away. 
 The Miserable Failure
 The mission: A mental health escape on a US$750 (RM3,318)-per-night budget
 Score: 2/10
 “I need a total mental reset,” I confessed to ChatGPT. “Can you find me a great yoga retreat in a luxurious resort, for May?” The query was rooted in wishful thinking: It’s a question for which I’d love to know the answer-if time away from my family (and work) were even halfway possible.
 Unfortunately, ChatGPT made the whole premise feel even more outlandish (sigh) when it recommended I head to the remote destination spa Ananda in the Himalayas or to a few posh spots in Bali-so very Eat, Pray, Love, I thought. I rephrased the question: Anything in Europe or the Caribbean? Sure, it said, and spouted off resorts in Sri Lanka and Thailand. 
 I started afresh. “I need a total mental reset,” I reiterated. 
 “Where should I go on vacation?” This time, I got a slightly better-rounded set of suggestions, all destinations rather than resorts. (Costa Rica came up again; I should really just take that trip.) But I wanted hotel recommendations, so the bot came back with classics: Ranch Malibu, SHA Wellness Clinic, Kamalaya Koh Samui.
 “My budget is US$750 (RM3,318) per night,” I followed up. “Do any of these work?”
 What ensued was pure comedy. “Yes, there are some options that would work with your US$750 (RM3,318) per night budget,” it told me. “Here are some examples.” The Ranch Malibu typically costs US$1,050 (RM4,645) per night, it said, but a cheaper package might bring the price to US$1,114 (RM4,928). SHA works out to US$826 (RM3,654) per night. And at Como Shambhala, in Bali, terrace suites start at US$815 (RM3,605) per night. 
 “This means that you could stay in a Terrace Suite for less than US$750 (RM3,318) per night,” it explained. I don’t think it was being sarcastic.
 The In Between
 The mission: A crowd-free  trip to Europe
 Score: 5/10
 Here’s a trip everyone is asking me about: “How do I do Europe this August without the crowds?” I relayed the question to ChatGPT. Its answers were generally sensible: Scandinavia, Portugal and Turkey were all on the list. I wondered about the latter and pressed further.
 “Isn’t Istanbul crowded in August?” I asked. “What’s the weather like?” It answered my questions with standard information that I might find in the front section of a guidebook. Ditto when I asked about cultural experiences: I got low-hanging fruit, such as going to a hammam or taking a cooking class, without specific recommendations.
 But when I asked about destinations to visit in Turkey beyond Istanbul, ChatGPT got creative. Sure, it gave me a few obvious answers like Cappadocia and Bodrum, but it also suggested Antalya and Trabzon, a small but picturesque city on the Black Sea that I had never heard about and couldn’t find written up in any travel magazine. 
 The Verdict
 Am I likely to go to Trabzon or to recommend it to others? I can’t say so. I just don’t know enough. And neither does ChatGPT.
 While the engine recommended a few markets where I could theoretically buy handicrafts and artisanal foods, as well as a handful of the city’s higher-end hotels, it was never going to make me feel confident booking a trip to an unknown spot halfway around the world. Given its inability to do basic math, AI doesn’t command enough trust for me to embrace recommendations that entail such high stakes.
 Which brings me to a point that I don’t see changing soon. When it comes to travel, it doesn’t make sense to trust anything automated or generic: That’s why we still find ourselves going back to the pros. What we’re looking for is happiness, right? This means something different to each of us. 
 Yet, as a preliminary planning tool, chatting with the bot was more satisfying than taking to Google and clicking on endless slideshows offering the best hotels in so-and-so places. When it works, ChatGPT’s randomness fosters a sense of discovery-which is what travel planning is all about. And when it doesn’t, well, at least it makes you laugh.

529882,StarEdu,7,02/04/2023,‘AI alone can’t save the world’,,"IF ChatGPT were a painter in the 19th century, it would not have been able to produce The Starry Night or Sunflowers because Vincent Van Gogh used an art style unknown at the time – an impressionist and post-impressionist style that altered art history. Before a style is invented or becomes known, there is no way for ChatGPT to “learn” from it.I can understand how people of his era might have found Van Gogh’s works to be less than perfect according to their definitions of perfection; however, in his paintings, the bold colours and expressive, often symbolic, images themselves represent genuine imperfection that is much more affecting than syntactic perfection.
 Van Gogh described his aim best: “I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say ‘he feels deeply, he feels tenderly’.” Like in The Starry Night, he showed us the way out of darkness and into the light; he showed us how we could transform our pain into something beautiful. Isn’t this – empathy in a story of a human, by a human, for a human – what we all need today?We live in such challenging times: Covid-19 has killed seven million people globally; the earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria have killed 50,000 people with numbers still rising; the Russia-Ukraine war has led to the deaths of at least 200,000 people; the United States-China trade war has affected the global economy; recession is on our doorstep with some 60,000 jobs expected to be lost this year. And that’s not all. We just became an ageing nation. By 2044, we will be a fully aged society with at least 14% of us aged 65 and over, which comes with challenges such as lower productivity, and higher labour and healthcare costs.This new world needs a new mindset. Universities, technology and people must come together across all disciplines to address problems facing the world today. 
 While we want education to embrace technology responsibly and prepare our children for a world we have yet to experience, we must also equip them with humanistic, artistic, practical and social skills, feelings, intellect, and empathy.
 Artificial intelligence (AI) or ChatGPT alone cannot save the world; we need people for that. We need stories, art and music that establish emotional and empathetic connections with the world and impact opinion, perception, and the understanding of each other, if we are to rise above the trials and tribulations of a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world.

529810,StarBiz 7,9,01/04/2023,Elon Musk wants to pause AI? It’s too late,,"ELON Musk and an array of public figures have signed their names to an open letter that went viral this week, calling for a six-month pause on training language models more powerful than GPT-4, the technology underpinning ChatGPT.
 Some strange inconsistencies with the signatories aside, the letter is odd.
 It criticises the deployment of powerful chatbot technology as rash, but also over-hypes their capabilities, drawing on the doom-mongering about artificial intelligence (AI) and killer robots that have captivated the press and distracted from more nuanced, real-world risks.
 “Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us?” it asks dramatically (emphasis from the authors). “Should we risk loss of control of our civilisation?” 
 Of course not, but there are issues we should be more worried about now, like the concentration of AI capabilities among a few increasingly secretive companies, inequality as artists find their work plagiarised without compensation, and all the risks to come from companies racing to plug ChatGPT into their systems. 
 On that last point, the toothpaste is already out of the tube.
 OpenAI last week launched a new system that will allow businesses to plug ChatGPT into their proprietary databases, allowing its chatbot to carry out tasks on their systems like retrieving information, making bookings and even running new software that it creates.
 While the plugin announcement didn’t get much attention in the mainstream press, many technologists saw it as a stunning leap forward for ChatGPT. Not only could it search and synthetise information it had been trained on, it could take action.
 Think about that for a moment. Machine learning systems make decisions in an inscrutable black box.
 OpenAI spent seven months testing GPT-4 before releasing it into to the wild, but its so-called “red team” engineers, who tested how it might be misused, could only cover a fraction of the ways it might be exploited by millions of real-world users.
 However much OpenAI has tested and prodded its system to make sure it is safe, no one really knows the full extent of its risks until it is deployed publicly.
 And those risks become more serious when ChatGPT can start doing things on the web. 
 Taking such gambles is, of course, what made ChatGPT so popular.
 OpenAI made a bet by making ChatGPT public and the result was public adulation and viral success for an AI team that’s tiny compared with those that work for Big Tech firms.
 Now with these plugins OpenAI is making another gamble, giving ChatGPT even more capabilities and unleashing it to businesses. 
 So far, 11 companies including Expedia Group Inc and payments operator Klarna Bank SB have “plugged” ChatGPT into their servers as initial test cases.
 Some of the new capabilities that OpenAI is offering businesses look dicey. One, called “code interpreter,” allows a business to get ChatGPT to write and even execute code on its behalf.
 Software developers typically use a code interpreter to make sure the programme they’re writing works as intended, allowing them to test small snippets.
 With the new plugin, ChatGPT can also write and test code, and that sounds potentially hazardous from a security perspective.
 “I hope that there are enough guardrails in place,” said Edo Liberty, the former head of Amazon AI Labs and current CEO of Pinecone, a startup that has a technical partnership with OpenAI on one of its new plugins, when I asked him about the risks of letting ChatGPT run code.
 “This is something that could theoretically be a vulnerability.”
 Marco Cardoso, a software engineer with Microsoft Corp based in Sao Paulo Brazil, tested ChatGPT’s new code-writing abilities and noted how remarkable it was that the system could “now make requests to any server on the Internet”.
 But that also meant there was “nothing stopping” ChatGPT from accessing a network it wasn’t supposed to.
 To prevent that, Cardoso put in his own guardrail, explicitly instructing the tool to only access one particular domain.
 But that puts extra responsibility on the users of ChatGPT, he noted.
 What’s to stop it from making a request to an unknown server?
 Ethan Mollick, a professor at Wharton who has experimented extensively with ChatGPT, tweeted this week that trying out its plugins put a spotlight on OpenAI’s own research about the “unpredictable risks” of connecting the tool to other systems.
 OpenAI’s nimbleness as a small company has allowed it to move quickly to release remarkable new technology to the public, from DALL-E 2 to ChatGPT to GPT-4, all within a year, achieving the kind of impact that much larger companies could only dream of. 
 But the flip side is that we’re all guinea pigs for utterly new and potentially flawed technology.
 In some ways, it doesn’t really matter if OpenAI agrees to the open letter and pauses its development work for six months.
 With companies rushing to plug ChatGPT into their systems and test it out on the public, it may already be too late. — Bloomberg

 According to the European Union’s transparency register, the Future of Life Institute is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, as well as London-based effective altruism group Founders Pledge, and Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
 The concerns come as EU police force Europol on Monday joined a chorus of ethical and legal concerns over advanced AI like ChatGPT, warning about the potential misuse of the system in phishing attempts, disinformation and cybercrime.
 Meanwhile, the UK government unveiled proposals for an “adaptable” regulatory framework around AI.
 The government’s approach, outlined in a policy paper published on Wednesday, would split responsibility for governing AI between its regulators for human rights, health and safety, and competition, rather than create a new body dedicated to the technology.
 Musk, whose carmaker Tesla is using AI for an autopilot system, has been vocal about his concerns about AI.
 Since its release last year, Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT has prompted rivals to accelerate developing similar large language models, and companies to integrate generative AI models into their products.
 Sam Altman, chief executive at OpenAI, hasn’t signed the letter, according to a spokesperson at Future of Life.
 “The letter isn’t perfect, but the spirit is right: we need to slow down until we better understand the ramifications,” said Gary Marcus, a professor at New York University who signed the letter.

528098,StarBiz,10,27/03/2023,Microsoft threatens to restrict         data from rival AI search tools,,"NEW YORK: Microsoft Corp has threatened to cut off access to its Internet-search data, which it licences to rival search engines, if they don’t stop using it as the basis for their own artificial intelligence (AI) chat products, according to sources.
 The software maker licences the data in its Bing search index – a map of the Internet that can be quickly scanned in real time – to other companies that offer web search, such as Apollo Global Management Inc’s Yahoo and DuckDuckGo. 
 In February, Microsoft integrated a cousin of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chat technology, into Bing.
 Rivals quickly moved to roll out their own AI chatbots as hype built around the buzzy technology. 
 This week, Alphabet Inc’s Google publicly released Bard, its conversational AI product. 
 DuckDuckGo, a search engine that emphasises privacy, introduced DuckAssist, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to summarise answers to search queries. 
 You.com and Neeva Inc – two newer search engines that debuted in 2021 – have also debuted AI-fuelled search services, YouChat and NeevaAI.
 These search chatbots aim to combine the conversational skills of ChatGPT with the information provided by a conventional search engine. 
 DuckDuckGo, You.com and Neeva’s regular search engines all use Bing to provide some of their information, because indexing the entire web is costly – it requires servers to store data and a constant crawl of the Internet to incorporate updates. It would be similarly complex and pricey to get together that data for a search chatbot.
 Microsoft has told at least two customers that using its Bing search index to feed their AI chat tools violates the terms of their contract. The Redmond, Washington-based tech company said it may terminate the licences providing access to its search index. 
 If they were cut off from Microsoft’s index, smaller search engines would have a hard time finding an alternative. — Bloomberg",york microsoft corp cut access internet search data licence rival search engine basis artificial intelligence chat product source software maker data search internet real time company web search apollo global management yahoo duckduckgo february integrated cousin chatgpt openai technology rival roll chatbots buzzy technology week bard conversational product duckduckgo search engine privacy introduced duckassist feature artificial intelligence summarise answer query search engine debuted search service neevaai search chatbots combine conversational skill chatgpt conventional search engine duckduckgo regular search engine entire web costly server data constant crawl internet incorporate update complex pricey data search chatbot microsoft customer search feed chat tool term contract washington tech company terminate licence access search cut microsoft search engine hard time alternative bloomberg,"[(2, 0.2155271), (5, 0.7781768)]",5
525932,Lifestyle,3,20/03/2023,AI could help  fight against poaching,,"A Dutch non-profit organisation has developed a smart camera system that can detect poachers and the presence of wild animals in real time. This ­“camera trap” could prove useful in vast areas, such as national parks in Africa, where rangers are seldom ­alerted in time.
 Hack The Planet, a non-profit ­organisation based in the Netherlands, has designed a new camera system capable of spotting poachers in real time. This new “camera trap” uses machine learning, and therefore ­artificial intelligence, to analyse in real time the photos taken by the camera.
 Using sensors, this system detects the presence of humans, but also animals, and is even capable of distinguishing between different types of animals.
 “We developed a smart camera system that can, in real time, track down people or animals in huge remote areas,” Hack the Planet engineer, Thijs Suijten, told Euronews. If a presence is detected, the system sends an immediate alert to the forest rangers, who can then intervene if necessary.
 The smart camera is equipped with a satellite uplink, allowing it to stay ­connected regardless of location, ­without the need for a WiFi network. Moreover, the system is powered by solar panels, making it particularly energy efficient.This smart camera could also be used to track wildlife biodiversity through its sensors. Otherwise, it could provide authorities with wildlife alerts, for when elephants are in proximity to residential areas, for example. In fact, these animals can cause problems for residents by entering agricultural areas and trampling plantations.
 Hack The Planet’s invention was ­tested in the Lopé National Park in Gabon during a pilot trial conducted with the University of Stirling in Scotland. The study, which lasted 72 days, found that the smart camera ­system was capable of operating for at least three months without the need for human intervention.
 Over the course of the 72 days, more than 800 photos were taken, including 217 of elephants. The AI was able to achieve 82% accuracy in recognising elephants. The average time from image capture to the receipt of an alert by the rangers was about seven minutes.
 According to a recent report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 2,707 rhinos were killed between 2018 and 2021, mostly in South Africa, where 80% of the world’s rhinos are found.
 Despite a decline in poaching in recent years, there is still a long way to go to completely eradicate it.

523602,Lifestyle,2,13/03/2023,Brands adopt AI tools despite risk,,"EVEN if you haven’t tried artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can write essays and poems or conjure new images on command, chances are the companies that make your household products are already starting to do so.
 Mattel has put the AI image generator Dall-E to work by having it come up with ideas for new Hot Wheels toy cars. 
 Used vehicle seller CarMax is summarising thousands of customer reviews with the same “generative” AI technology that powers the popular chatbot ChatGPT.
 Meanwhile, Snapchat is adding a chatbot to its messaging service. And the grocery delivery company Instacart is integrating ChatGPT to answer customers’ food questions.
 Coca-Cola plans to use generative AI to help create new marketing content. And while the company hasn’t detailed exactly how it plans to deploy the technology, the move reflects the growing pressure on businesses to harness tools that many of their employees and consumers are already trying on their own.
 “We must embrace the risks,” said Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey in a recent video announcing a partnership with startup OpenAI – maker of both Dall-E and ChatGPT – through an alliance led by the consulting firm Bain. 
 “We need to embrace those risks intelligently, experiment, build on those experiments, drive scale, but not taking those risks is a hopeless point of view to start from.”
 Indeed, some AI experts warn that businesses should carefully consider potential harms to customers, society and their own reputations before rushing to embrace ChatGPT and similar products in the workplace.
 “I want people to think deeply before deploying this technology,” said Claire Leibowicz of The Partnership on AI, a non-profit group founded and sponsored by the major tech providers that recently released a set of recommendations for companies producing AI-generated synthetic imagery, audio and other media. 
 “They should play around and tinker, but we should also think, what purpose are these tools serving in the first place?”
 Some companies have been experimenting with AI for a while. 
 Mattel revealed its use of OpenAI’s image generator in October as a client of Microsoft, which has a partnership with OpenAI that enables it to integrate its technology into Microsoft’s Cloud computing platform.
 But it wasn’t until the Nov 30 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a free public tool, that widespread interest in generative AI tools began seeping into workplaces and executive suites.
 “ChatGPT really sort of brought home how powerful they were,” said Eric Boyd, a Microsoft executive who leads its AI platform. 
 “That’s changed the conversation in a lot of people’s minds, where they really get it on a deeper level. My kids use it and my parents use it.”
 There is reason for caution, however. While text generators like ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing chatbot can make the process of writing emails, presentations and marketing pitches faster and easier, they also have a tendency to confidently present misinformation as fact. 
 Image generators trained on a huge trove of digital art and photography have raised copyright concerns from the original creators of those works.
 “For companies that are really in the creative industry, if they want to make sure that they have copyright protection for those models, that’s still an open question,” said attorney Anna Gressel of the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, which advises businesses on how to use AI.
 A safer use has been thinking of the tools as a brainstorming “thought partner” that won’t produce the final product, Gressel said.
 “It helps create mockups that then are going to be turned by a human into something that is more concrete,” she said.
 And that also helps ensure that humans don’t get replaced by AI. Forrester Research analyst Rowan Curran said the tools should speed up some of the “nitty-gritty” of office tasks – much like previous innovations such as word processors and spell checkers – rather than put people out of work, as some fear.
 “Ultimately, it’s part of the workflow,” Curran said. “It’s not like we’re talking about having a large language model just generating an entire marketing campaign and having that launch without expert senior marketers and all kinds of other controls.”
 For consumer-facing chatbots getting integrated into smartphone apps, it gets a little trickier, Curran said, with a need for guardrails around technology that can respond to users’ questions in unexpected ways.
 Public awareness fueled growing competition among Cloud computing providers Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which sell their services to big organisations and have the massive computing power needed to train and operate AI models. 
 Microsoft announced earlier this year that it was investing billions more dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, though it also competes with the startup as a direct provider of AI tools.
 Google, which pioneered advancements in generative AI but has been cautious about introducing them to the public, is now playing catch up to capture its commercial possibilities, including an upcoming Bard chatbot. 
 Facebook parent Meta, another leader in AI research, builds similar technology but doesn’t sell it to businesses in the same way as its big tech peers. Amazon has taken a more muted tone, but makes its ambitions clear through its partnerships – most recently, an expanded collaboration between its Cloud computing division AWS and the startup Hugging Face, maker of a ChatGPT rival called Bloom. 
 Hugging Face decided to double down on its Amazon partnership after seeing the explosion of demand for generative AI products, said Clement Delangue, the startup’s co-founder and CEO. 
 But Delangue contrasted his approach with competitors such as OpenAI, which doesn’t disclose its code and datasets. Hugging Face hosts a platform that allows developers to share open-source AI models for text, image and audio tools, which can lay the foundation for building different products. 
 That transparency is “really important because that’s the way for regulators, for example, to understand these models and be able to regulate”, he said. 
 It is also a way for “underrepresented people to understand where the biases can be (and) how the models have been trained”, so that the bias can be mitigated, Delangue said. – AP",artificial intelligence tool essay conjure image chance company product mattel image generator dall idea hot wheel toy car vehicle seller carmax thousand customer review generative technology power popular chatbot chatgpt chatbot service grocery delivery company instacart chatgpt answer customer food question cola plan generative create marketing content company plan deploy technology move pressure business harness tool employee consumer risk cola ceo quincey video partnership startup openai maker dall chatgpt alliance firm bain embrace risk build experiment scale risk hopeless expert business potential harm customer reputation embrace chatgpt product people technology claire leibowicz partnership profit sponsored major tech provider recommendation company synthetic imagery audio medium tinker purpose tool company mattel openai image generator client microsoft partnership openai integrate technology microsoft cloud platform nov release free public tool widespread generative tool workplace executive suite powerful eric boyd microsoft executive platform conversation lot people deeper level kid parent reason caution text generator microsoft chatbot process email presentation pitch easier tendency misinformation image generator huge digital art photography copyright concern original creator company industry copyright protection model attorney anna gressel law firm plimpton business safer thinking tool partner final product gressel mockups human concrete human forrester analyst rowan curran tool nitty gritty office task previous innovation word processor checker people workflow curran language model entire marketing campaign launch expert senior marketer control consumer chatbots smartphone apps trickier curran guardrail technology respond user question unexpected public awareness competition cloud provider microsoft google sell service organisation power train operate model billion dollar partnership openai startup direct provider tool google advancement generative cautious public catch capture commercial possibility bard chatbot facebook parent meta leader technology sell business tech peer tone ambition partnership collaboration cloud division aws maker chatgpt rival bloom hugging double amazon partnership explosion demand generative product clement delangue startup founder ceo delangue approach competitor code datasets host platform developer share source model image audio tool foundation building product transparency regulator model underrepresented people bias model delangue,"[(0, 0.46622294), (2, 0.1753109), (3, 0.3566139)]",0
523740,Main,21,13/03/2023,AI ‘sorry’ for destroying humanity at expo,,"San Francisco: Advances in artificial intelligence are coming so fast that a museum in San Francisco has imagined a memorial to the demise of humanity.
 “Sorry for killing most of humanity person with cap and mustache,” says a monitor welcoming a visitor to the “Misalignment Mus­eum,” an exhibit on the controversial technology. 
 The pieces in this show mix the disturbing with the comic, and this display has AI disburse pithy observations to visitors.
 “The concept of the museum is that we are in a post-apocalyptic world where artificial general intelligence has already destroyed most of humanity,” said Audrey Kim, the show’s curator.
 “But then the AI realises that was bad and creates a memorial to the human, so our show’s tagline is ‘sorry for killing most of humanity,’” she said.
 Artificial General Intelligence is a concept that is even more nebulous than AI that is cascading into everyday life, as seen in the emergence of  apps such as ChatGPT or Bing’s chatbot and all the hype surrounding them.
 AGI is “artificial intelligence that is able to do anything a human would be able to do,” integrating cognitive capacities into machines.
 All around San Francisco, and down the peninsula in Silicon Valley, startups are hot on the trail of the AGI holy grail. 
 Sam Altman, the founder of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, has said AGI can “elevate humanity” and change the “limits of possibilities”. 
 But Kim wants to trigger a reflection on the dangers of going too far.
 “There have been lots of conversations about the safety of AI in tech circles on Twitter and I think that’s very important,” she said.
 Kim is particularly fond of a sculpture called Paperclip Embrace: two busts of humans holding each other, made entirely of paperclips.
 The work refers to a metaphor by philosopher Nick Bostrom, who in the 2000s imagined what would happen if artificial intelligence was programmed to create paper clips. — AFP",san francisco advance artificial intelligence museum san francisco memorial demise humanity humanity person cap mustache monitor visitor misalignment mu eum exhibit controversial technology piece comic display disburse pithy observation visitor museum post apocalyptic artificial intelligence humanity audrey kim curator bad creates memorial human tagline humanity artificial intelligence concept nebulous everyday life emergence apps chatgpt chatbot hype agi artificial intelligence human cognitive capacity machine san francisco peninsula silicon valley startup hot trail agi holy grail sam altman founder chatgpt creator agi elevate humanity change limit possibility trigger reflection danger conversation safety tech circle fond sculpture paperclip embrace bust human paperclip refers nick bostrom happen artificial intelligence create paper clip,"[(5, 0.99103236)]",5
523250,Life Inspired,17,12/03/2023,Artificial Intelligence reveals the most favoured chocolate,,"Is there a chocolate that can satisfy everyone? Perhaps that’s still a way’s off but in any case, this particular chocolate was designed to appeal to a maximum number of consumers. A Finnish dairy company used artificial intelligence based on the opinions of more than one and a half million chocolate eaters to design the chocolate that appealed to the tastebuds of the most people. So what is it like?
 When it comes to chocolate, we all have our preferences: the French prefer dark chocolate, in concentrations of up to 30% while the European average is 5%. 
 Some prefer to bite into a bar while others instead salivate for chocolate spreads, or even candy bars with various fillings. Therefore it can be difficult for brands or chocolate makers to come up with a creation that appeals to the greatest number of people.
 In Finland, a company specialising in dairy products (Valio) and byproducts has found a way to design a chocolate that has as universal an appeal as possible: through the use of artificial intelligence. 
 More than one and a half million comments and opinions posted on social networks about milk chocolate were integrated into a software program to develop a recipe based on the most commonly shared taste preferences. 
 The result is a bar composed of five layers, each with a different flavour and texture, based on AI’s recommendations. Moreover, this milk chocolate bar contains 30% less sugar than regular chocolate and is lactose-free. And these characteristics are not afterthoughts for the Finnish company, which has developed a technology to remove lactose from its unique milk powder solution, which it used in this creation. – AFP Relaxnews",chocolate satisfy chocolate appeal maximum consumer finnish dairy company artificial intelligence opinion half chocolate eater chocolate tastebud people preference french dark chocolate concentration european average bite bar salivate chocolate spread bar filling difficult brand chocolate maker appeal people company dairy product valio byproduct design chocolate universal appeal artificial intelligence half comment opinion social network chocolate software program recipe taste preference bar layer texture recommendation milk chocolate bar sugar regular chocolate free characteristic afterthought finnish company technology lactose unique milk powder solution creation afp relaxnews,"[(5, 0.9892533)]",5

 Big tech companies from Alphabet Inc to Baidu Inc are speeding up the integration of generative AI – technology that has gained popularity for its ability to generate human-like text responses to queries – into their offerings.
 Microsoft said a line of business-intelligence and app-development tools within Power Platform, including Power Virtual Agent and AI Builder, was updated with the new capabilities.
 Power Virtual Agent, a tool for businesses to build chatbots, can now connect to internal company resources to generate summaries of weekly reports and customer queries.
 Microsoft has also added generative AI capabilities to AI Builder, which lets businesses automate workflows, and launched a new version of its business management platform Dynamics 365 based on the technology.
 Dynamics 365 Copilot, the latest version of Microsoft’s tool that includes a number of applications for sales, customer service and marketing, integrates AI to automate certain tasks like data gathering and analysis or creating an email campaign, among other capabilities.

521272,Lifestyle,3,06/03/2023,Europe scrambles in AI race,,"GENERATIVE AI chatbots unveiled by US tech firms have captivated the world with their spectacular successes and failures in engaging in conversations.
 But European firms focusing more on business applications are confident they won’t be left in the dust in the rapidly developing field, even as they redouble their efforts.
 “The launch of ChatGPT has changed everything. It has been a wake-up call for European firms,” said Laurent Daudet at French startup LightOn.
 “But the battle for generative AI isn’t over,” he added.
 Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been increasingly present in everyday life for decades, but the November launch of the conversational robot ChatGPT from startup OpenAI marked a turning point in its perception by the public and investors.
 Generative AI, of which ChatGPT is an example, wades through oceans of data to conjure up original content – an image, a poem, a thousand- word essay – in seconds on a simple request.
 Despite still being prone to give incorrect answers and lead conversations in bizarre directions, firms are rushing to develop practical applications for the technology.
 Microsoft has backed OpenAI financially and begun to integrate ChatGPT features into its Teams platform, with expectations that it will adapt the tool to its Office suite and Bing search engine.
 Google plans to rush out its own conversational chatbot named Bard, but Facebook-owner Meta is working with researchers before attempting another release after being forced to take its bot offline last November after it shared biased and incorrect results.
 A number of US startups are also active in the space.
 European bots
 In Europe, dozens of startups are working on developing their own bots based on existing AI models or, more rarely, developing their own.
 All of them are using open source code, at least in part, to build the corpus of knowledge fed into the bots, just as the US tech titans have.
 Among the leading European startups is Germany’s Aleph Alpha, which is developing a multimedia chatbot.
 In France, there is Bloom, a scientific language model being built by hundreds of researchers coordinated by a US-French startup called Hugging Face with the support of France’s national scientific research centre, CNRS. Hugging Face recently struck a partnership with Amazon.
 Others are pursuing more specialised bots, such as German firm Stable Diffusion with its text-to-image model released last year and Swedish company Sana Labs’ AI, which manages information.
 All have raised tens of millions in funding from investors, which leaves them far behind the billions spent by US tech giants.
 Competitive tech
 Nevertheless, European firms believe their technology is competitive and can take a slice of the emerging market.
 Aleph Alpha founder and CEO Jonas Andrulis said its latest bot will be much more powerful than OpenAI’s latest GPT-3 model, which has captured global attention.
 “We will release our 300 billion parameter model this year,” Andrulis said. 
 The GPT-3 model has only 175 billion.
 He said his firm was the only one so far to offer a model that can take both text and images as input prompts, which opens up the possibility of different applications.
 Aleph Alpha is targeting high-value work at companies and Andrulis acknowledged they are rushing to compete against Microsoft.
 “For these customers, it’s either Microsoft or us,” he said.
 Daudet, a co-founder of Paris-based LightOn, said their models were also as performant as GPT-3.
 “The number of usages is phenomenal; conversation is one, but we aren’t going to fight on the ground on which the Americans excel,” he said.
 “We’re going to offer solutions for companies: summarising documents or email exchanges, generating specialised content,” he added.
 Multilingual models
 Many European AI models are multilingual. Bloom’s model works in seven languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish and French.
 Aleph Alpha’s works in five.
 This is an advantage as Europeans prefer tools in their native languages. But the quality depends on the volume of texts fed to them, and there English has had an advantage.
 “Our clients prefer GPT-3 for English texts and our mode for German and French,” said Aleph Alpha’s Andrulis.
 One concern is the future  of open source code, upon which all current AI models  are based. With competition heating up, companies may become less willing to share, inhibiting further innovation  by startups.
 Pablo Ducru, a French-educated researcher and entrepreneur who has moved to the United States to seek funding for his AI project, said European firms don’t need large teams, but believe three other elements are important.
 “First of all, calculating power, which is expensive.  The access to data for training. And finally, talent, which raises the question of salaries,” he said.
 Another element that could make a difference is user feedback. With ChatGPT now interacting with over 100 million Internet users, it could extend its lead. – AFP",generative chatbots tech firm spectacular success failure conversation european firm business application confident dust field redouble effort launch call european firm laurent daudet french startup lighton battle generative artificial intelligence everyday life decade launch conversational robot chatgpt startup openai perception public investor generative chatgpt wade ocean data conjure original content image poem word simple request prone incorrect answer conversation bizarre direction firm practical application technology microsoft openai integrate chatgpt feature platform expectation tool office suite search engine google plan conversational chatbot facebook owner meta researcher release bot offline november incorrect startup active space european bot dozen startup bot model source code corpus knowledge bot titan european startup aleph multimedia chatbot france bloom scientific language model hundred researcher french startup support france national scientific centre cnrs partnership amazon bot german firm stable diffusion text image model swedish company lab manages ten million investor billion tech giant competitive tech european firm technology competitive slice market aleph alpha founder ceo jonas andrulis bot powerful openai gpt model global attention release parameter model andrulis gpt model firm offer model text image prompt possibility application company compete microsoft customer daudet founder paris lighton model gpt usage phenomenal conversation fight ground offer solution company document email exchange specialised content multilingual model european model multilingual bloom model english chinese spanish french aleph alpha advantage european tool native language quality volume text fed english advantage client gpt english text mode german french aleph alpha andrulis concern future source code current model competition company share innovation startup ducru french researcher entrepreneur united seek funding project european firm element power expensive access data talent raise question salary difference user feedback chatgpt internet user lead afp,"[(3, 0.99667823)]",3
521034,StarEdu,7,05/03/2023,Aye to AI,Time to rethink how we teach and learn,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently generated much buzz. 
 First, it was data-driven AI systems DALL-E 2 from OpenAI and its open-source counterpart Stable Diffusion that could create realistic images given descriptions in natural language. 
 Then came ChatGPT, a conversational AI system that enables human-like conversations with a chatbot. The language model behind ChatGPT can answer questions and help with tasks such as writing emails and essays, crafting codes, and composing music. 
 There is nothing magical about DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT; the computing power and capacity that we have today have enabled machines to learn from vast amounts of data beyond human ability. DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT are part of a new technological wave called generative AI.
 Just like how the recent Covid-19 pandemic became a catalyst for digital transformation in many organisations, expect AI to disrupt the way we teach and learn. 
 In a recent article featured in The New York Times (“Alarmed by AI Chatbots, Universities Start Revamping How They Teach”, Jan 16), a professor at an American university rated a paper produced by ChatGPT as “the best paper in the class”. 
 So, should we shy away from AI? Should we ban the likes of ChatGPT from our classrooms? It’s time for educators to accept that the future has arrived and consider how AI can help us better our teaching and learning. 
 Personalised education 
 In one of his talks, the late Sir Ken Robinson likened today’s education system to a factory production line – increasingly standardised. We now have an opportunity to make learning personalised. There are opportunities to use AI-powered learning systems to design personalised learning pathways and content. 
 This is made possible by analysing student performance data collected through modern learning management systems (LMS). With proper guidance, we can even use technologies like ChatGPT to generate customised reading materials and assessment tasks. 
 Top this up with an ever-present human-like avatar of a student’s favourite tutor embodied in a mobile app providing immediate feedback and guidance, and we can help students stay on track.
 Workload automation
 AI-enabled robotic process automation can be used to automate the assessment of a student’s work. For example, there are now tools to summarise articles, essays and texts. 
 Students will be able to get timely feedback to improve their learning. Routine administrative tasks, such as scheduling and record management, can also be automated. 
 This helps reduce educators’ workload, enabling them to focus on delivering high-quality educational experiences to students.
 Democratising content  creation
 The demand for online self-paced learning courses has risen, driven by changing learning behaviours and the desire for flexibility. For these courses to be engaging, content is vital.
 Developing engaging content is both challenging and time-consuming. DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion now enable one to produce images based on a given text description (text-to-image). Tools like elai.io and synthesia.io use AI to rapidly create customised videos with a presenter without a camera, studio or green screen.
 Rethinking assessment
 Now that we have better access to technology and computing power, it is an opportune time to rethink how we do assessments. 
 We have to shift away from traditional forms of assessments to more authentic forms of assessments that reflect the real world where students are evaluated on what they can do, not merely on what they know.
 Imagine assessing students on skills and competencies required for a flood search and rescue mission. Instead of testing only head knowledge (traditional assessment), we could use generative AI to render realistic flood scenes and scenarios which are deployed in an extended reality (XR) system. 
 Students then take their assessment using the XR system. Learning outcomes attainment is assessed by analysing data recorded from the simulations.
 To make AI work for education, we need to have that human interaction and personal connection that is crucial for the character development and motivation of students.
 It is also important to ensure equitable access to AI if we are to avoid increasing the digital divide. Implementing AI can be expensive. Users will need to have already attained certain skills. 
 We will also have to figure out how we can navigate past challenges such as the limited scope of AI, and questions of intellectual property ownership and ethical implications.
 AI is driven by past human experiences embodied in data. There is an implicit assumption that the past reflects the future. Some argue that AI is excellent for precise tasks, as it is a piece of code, but not very good at being creative.
 Ownership of AI-generated content becomes complex when the AI is trained on other copyrighted content and as AI systems are typically data-driven, data privacy and security naturally become concerns. The challenge is also to prevent AI systems from perpetuating human bias embodied in data.
 So, could AI one day replace teachers? Unimaginable in many ways but we can expect the role of the teacher to change from being a singular source of knowledge to one that supports and guides students through the learning process as a facilitator. 
 It is customary for me to remind graduates that they must be able to unlearn and relearn new skills and competencies in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world. As educators, are we ready to do the same as we embrace AI as part of our toolbox? The first step we can take is to develop AI literacy and stay abreast of its developments.

519868,StarBiz,11,01/03/2023,Zoom jumps   on AI bandwagon,Company forecasts upbeat 2024 profit targets,"CALIFORNIA: Zoom Video Communications Inc says it will integrate more artificial intelligence (AI) into its products and forecast annual profit above Wall Street estimates, sending the company’s shares up 8% in extended trading.
 Analysts predict the AI tech will be a major driver for future growth for the tech industry, which has been grappling with slowing demand amid recessionary fears.
 The AI race picked up pace after Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT last year prompted heavyweights from Alphabet Inc to China’s Baidu Inc to announce their own offerings.
 “I like that Zoom is proactively talking about these opportunities today and I honestly believe it’s necessary, especially given Microsoft is already including ChatGPT as part of Teams Premium,” said RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria.
 San Jose, California-based Zoom forecast fiscal 2024 profit between US$4.11 (RM18.43) and US$4.18 (RM18.74) per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of US$3.66 (RM16.41) per share, according to Refinitiv data.
 “The age of AI and large language models has arrived,” said chief executive Eric Yuan during a call with analysts, adding that AI can “truly help” the company.
 Zoom is also benefiting from steady demand for its video-conferencing service from the ongoing shift to hybrid work models and cost cuts. 
 Earlier this month, it announced an about 15% reduction in its workforce.
 On an adjusted basis, Zoom earned US$1.22 (RM5.47) per share for the fourth quarter ended Jan 31, compared with estimates of 81 cents (RM3.63) per share.
 Revenue grew 4% to US$1.12bil (RM5bil), above analysts’ average expectation of US$1.10bil (RM4.93bil).
 Finance chief Kelly Steckelberg said the growth was primarily driven by strength in Zoom’s enterprise business.
 The company, however, expects 2024 revenue between US$4.44bil (RM19.9bil) and US$4.46bil (RM20bil), below average Street estimate of US$4.60bil (RM20.6bil).
 “The revenue outlook is softer than initially expected, partly due to macro pressures and especially given declining online business,” Jaluria said. — Reuters",california zoom video communication artificial intelligence product annual profit wall street estimate company share trading analyst tech major driver future growth tech industry demand recessionary fear race pace microsoft openai chatgpt heavyweight china baidu offering zoom opportunity chatgpt team rbc analyst rishi jaluria san jose california zoom forecast fiscal profit share analyst average estimate share data age language model chief executive eric call analyst company zoom steady demand video service shift hybrid model cost cut month reduction workforce basis zoom share fourth quarter jan cent share revenue bil bil analyst average expectation bil bil finance chief steckelberg growth driven strength zoom enterprise business company revenue bil bil bil bil average street estimate bil bil revenue outlook macro pressure online business jaluria reuters,"[(0, 0.9920293)]",0
519160,Main,11,27/02/2023,Jay Chou: I will not be replaced by artificial intelligence,,"KING of Mandopop Jay Chou believes that artificial intelligence (AI) will not be able to replace music content creators like him, Sin Chew Daily reported.
 Chou, who is a prolific lyricist and composer, said he was not worried about the rise in AI technology.
 Although he acknowledged that “AI can do a lot of things”, he felt that it would not replace the creation of music.
 His fans have flocked to his social media account to show support, saying that they could not believe a computer software could take the place of the superstar.
 “No one can replace the king!” someone posted.
 Chou, 44, began his career in music as a lyricist and composer for other celebrities.
 In 2000, he released his first album with the help of his mentor Jacky Wu, an influential character in Taiwan’s entertainment business.One of the songs won the 24th Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs award.
 His second studio album, Fantasy, won him five Golden Melody awards, including Album of the Year, which cemented his name in showbusiness.
 AI has gone mainstream with ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model that is trained from vast amounts of data from the Internet to answer prompts by users in a human-like manner.
 The technology is touted to have the capability of replacing many jobs.
 The Internet is also seeing the rise in AI-powered services like Midjourney, which creates images from textual descriptions, and Soundful, which generates royalty free-music.
 > A  newly-released song by Chinese singer Li Ronghao has led to Internet searches for smoked plum sauce to increase 200-fold on shopping sites, Sin Chew Daily also reported. 
 Titled Dark Plum Sauce, the catchy tune is getting popular among music fans.
 Following its release about two months ago, the song had inadvertently led to a spike in online searches for the sauce.
 In fact, it was the eighth most searched item on Taobao, one of China’s largest online shopping platforms.
 Fans of the song who have never tried it before were eager to get themselves a jar.
 Many now jokingly call it “Li Ronghao sauce” and that it contained the “flavours of one’s first love”.
 Smoked plum is often used in East Asian cuisine and medicine.  
 The sauce is made with smoked plums, hawthorn, orange peel, roselle and sugar.
 Those who liked the song indicated that their favourite line  was “your smile is just like dark plum sauce”.
 Many of them speculated that Li was referring to his wife, singer Rainie Yang, 39.",mandopop jay chou artificial intelligence music content creator chew chou prolific lyricist composer rise technology lot creation music fan social medium support computer software superstar chou career music lyricist composer celebrity album mentor jacky influential character taiwan entertainment business song top chinese gold song studio album fantasy golden melody award album showbusiness mainstream chatgpt language model vast amount data internet answer user human manner technology capability job internet rise service midjourney image textual description soundful generates free music song chinese singer ronghao internet search plum sauce increase site chew titled dark plum catchy tune popular music fan month spike online search eighth searched item taobao china largest online shopping platform fan eager jar call ronghao sauce flavour east asian cuisine medicine sauce plum hawthorn orange peel roselle sugar song smile dark plum sauce wife singer rainie yang,"[(2, 0.99337775)]",2
516818,Lifestyle,3,20/02/2023,Teachers invite AI to class,,"UNDER the fluorescent lights of a fifth grade classroom in Lexington, Kentucky, in the United States, Donnie Piercey instructed his 23 students to try and outwit the “robot” that was churning out writing assignments.
 The robot was the new artificial intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT, which can generate everything from essays and haikus to term papers within seconds. The technology has panicked teachers and prompted school districts to block access to the site. 
 But Piercey has taken another approach by embracing it as a teaching tool, saying his job is to prepare students for a world where knowledge of AI will be required.
 “This is the future,” said Piercey, who describes ChatGPT as just the latest technology in his 17 years of teaching that prompted concerns about the potential for cheating. 
 The calculator, spellcheck, Google, Wikipedia, YouTube. Now all his students have Chromebooks on their desks. 
 “As educators, we haven’t figured out the best way to use AI yet. But it’s coming, whether we want it to or not.”
 One exercise in his class pitted students against the machine in a lively, interactive writing game. Piercey asked students to “Find the Bot:” Each student summarised a text about boxing champion and Kentucky icon Muhammad Ali, then tried to figure out which was written by the chatbot.
 At the elementary school level, Piercey is less worried about cheating and plagiarism than high school teachers. 
 His district has blocked students from ChatGPT while allowing teachers access. Many educators around the country say districts need time to evaluate and figure out the chatbot, but they also acknowledge the futility of a ban that today’s tech-savvy students can work around.“To be perfectly honest, do I wish it could be uninvented? Yes. But it happened,” said Steve Darlow, the technology trainer at Florida’s Santa Rosa County District Schools, which has blocked the application on school-issued devices and networks.
 He sees the advent of AI platforms as both “revolutionary and disruptive” to education. 
 He envisions teachers asking ChatGPT to make “amazing lesson plans for a substitute” or even for help grading papers. 
 “I know it’s lofty talk, but this is a real game changer. You are going to have an advantage in life, business and education from using it.”
 ChatGPT quickly became a global phenomenon after its November launch, and rival companies, including Google, are racing to release their own versions of AI-powered chatbots.The topic of AI platforms and how schools should respond drew hundreds of educators to conference rooms at the Future of Education Technology Conference in New Orleans last month, where Texas math teacher Heather Brantley gave an enthusiastic talk on the “Magic of Writing with AI for all Subjects”.Brantley said she was amazed at ChatGPT’s ability to make her sixth grade math lessons more creative and applicable to everyday life.
 “I’m using ChatGPT to enhance all my lessons,” she said in an interview. The platform is blocked for students but open to teachers at her school, White Oak Intermediate. 
 “Take any lesson you’re doing and say, ‘Give me a real-world example,’ and you’ll get examples from today – not 20 years ago when the textbooks we’re using were written.”
 For a lesson about slope, the chatbot suggested students build ramps out of cardboard and other items found in a classroom, then measure the slope. 
 For teaching about surface area, the chatbot noted that sixth graders would see how the concept applied to real life when wrapping gifts or building a cardboard box, said Brantley.
 She is urging districts to train staff to use the AI platform to stimulate student creativity and problem-solving skills. 
 “We have an opportunity to guide our students towards the next big thing that will be part of their entire lives. Let’s not block it and shut them out.”
 Students in Piercey’s class said the novelty of working with a chatbot makes learning fun.
 After a few rounds of Find the Bot, Piercey asked his class what skills it helped them hone. Hands shot up. 
 “How to properly summarise and correctly capitalise words and use commas,” said one student. A lively discussion ensued on the importance of developing a writing voice and how some of the chatbot’s sentences lacked flair or sounded stilted.
 Trevor James Medley, 11, felt that sentences written by students “have a little more feeling. More backbone. More flavour”.
 Next, the class turned to playwriting, or as the worksheet handed out by Piercey called it: “Pl-ai Writing”. 
 The students broke into groups and wrote down (using pencil and paper) the characters of a short play with three scenes to unfold in a plot that included a problem that needed to be solved.
 Piercey fed details from worksheets into the ChatGPT site, along with instructions to set the scenes inside a fifth grade classroom and to add a surprise ending. 
 Line by line, it generated fully formed scripts, which the students edited, briefly rehearsed and then performed.
 One was about a class computer that escapes, with students going on a hunt to find it. 
 The play’s creators giggled over the unexpected plot twists that the chatbot introduced, including sending the students on a time travel adventure.
 “First of all, I was impressed,” said Olivia Laksi, 10, one of the protagonists. She liked how the chatbot came up with creative ideas. 
 But she also liked how Piercey urged them to revise any phrases or stage directions they didn’t like. 
 “It’s helpful in the sense that it gives you a starting point. It’s a good idea generator.”
 She and classmate Katherine McCormick, 10, said they can see the pros and cons of working with chatbots. 
 They can help students navigate writer’s block and help those who have trouble articulating their thoughts on paper. And there is no limit to the creativity it can add to classwork.
 The fifth graders seemed unaware of the hype or controversy surrounding ChatGPT. For these children, who will grow up as the world’s first native AI users, their approach is simple: Use it for suggestions, but do your own work.
 “You shouldn’t take advantage of it,” McCormick says.

516590,Lifestyle,4,19/02/2023,"AI, chat bots, and matters of the heart",,"QUESTION: Will a chat bot replace Thelma any time soon? How do we know if it’s not ChatGPT replying on behalf of our favourite Star-Lifestyle columnist?
 Or will we be comfortable typing in our heart’s discontent and asking for guidance from artificial intelligence (AI)? Well, there are already some highly educated people doing so, judging by Jason Godfrey’s column last week (“Maybe we need to rethink those career paths”, Big Smile, No Teeth, StarLifestyle, Feb 12.)
 It may sound silly for we know a computer program can’t sensibly solve problems of the heart at the moment – but who knows what could happen when AI reaches version 10.0, becoming smarter than humans even?
 But I believe that no matter how intelligent it gets, AI will never be able to have emotions and feelings. It can’t possibly understand the anguish and anxiety of living. Simply said it takes a human to understand another human (though some pet owners believe their pets understand them).
 Søren Kierkegaard, the Danish existentialist thinker and author, once said, “Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced”. Do you agree?
 Sometimes life has no answer and a listening ear is just enough. As for matters of the heart, maybe it requires a leap of faith. AI couldn’t do that because there is some- thing that machines don’t  have:  what we call intuition.

516492,StarBiz 7,6,18/02/2023,Who will be AI’s  first billionaire?,,"GREAT advances in technology often result in vast increases of wealth. So as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continues, one obvious question is who will profit – and by how much. 
 My view, which may be deflationary for entrepreneurs but good for consumers, is this: Relative to how much AI changes the world, its early pioneers won’t get especially rich.
 Truly fundamental changes alter every part of the economy. They do so only by becoming freely or readily available across a wide range of sectors. Money will be made from AI, but it will be hard to capture anything close to full value.
 Consider the Internet. The most successful entrepreneurs in social media have earned huge fortunes – but the early developers of the Internet itself did not. 
 Even as late as 1992, if you were convinced the Internet would be a huge thing, there was no easy way to make money from that insight. Just as the inventors of early printing presses, such as Gutenberg, did not become the richest nobles of their time.
 And that raises another obvious question: Are the current manifestations of AI – the Large Language Models (LLMs) embodied in services such as ChatGPT, for example – more like the Internet and the printing press, or more like social media? 
 The evidence so far suggests they are somewhere in between.
 Facebook benefits from network effects. That is, you want to be able to connect with friends and family, so a social networking service of size and prominence will have a considerable advantage in the marketplace. Similarly, how many people have really left Twitter for Mastodon?
 The major AI companies do not seem to have this advantage. If I use OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and you use Anthropic’s Claude, we still can easily communicate with each other – through other media. It is even possible to imagine linking one service to the other, using text, through a third-party intermediary.
 A small number of AI services, possibly even a single one, likely will end up better than the others for a wide variety of purposes. Such companies might buy the best hardware, hire the best talent and manage their brands relatively well. 
 But they will face competition from other companies offering lesser (but still good) services at a lower price. 
 When it comes to LLMs, there is already a proliferation of services, with Baidu, Google and Anthropic products due in the market. The market for AI image generation is more crowded yet. 
 In economic terms, the dominant AI company might turn out to be something like Salesforce. 
 Salesforce is a major seller of business and institutional software, and its products are extremely popular. Yet the valuation of the company, as of this writing, is about US$170bil (RM753bil). 
 That’s hardly chump change, but it does not come close to the US$1 trillion (RM4.43 trillion) valuations elsewhere in the tech sector.
 OpenAI, a current market leader, has received a private valuation of US$29bil (RM128bil). Again, that’s not a reason to feel sorry for anyone – but there are plenty of companies you might not have heard of that are worth far more.
 AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical corporation, has a valuation of about US$271bil (RM1.2 trillion), almost 10 times higher than OpenAI’s.
 To be clear, none of this is evidence that AI will peter out. Instead, AI services will enter almost everyone’s workflow and percolate through the entire economy. 
 Everyone will be wealthier, most of all the workers and consumers who use the thing. The key ideas behind AI will spread and be replicated – and the major AI companies of the future will face plenty of competition, limiting their profits.
 In fact, AI’s ubiquity may degrade its value, at least from a market perspective. It’s likely the AI boom has yet to peak, but the speculative fervor is almost palpable. 
 Share prices have responded to AI developments enthusiastically. Buzzfeed shares rose 150% in one day last month, for example, after the company announced it would use AI to generate content. 
 Does that really make sense, given all the competition BuzzFeed faces?
 It’s when those prices and valuations start falling that you will know the AI revolution has truly arrived. 
 In the end, the greatest impact of AI may be on its users, not its investors or even its inventors. — Bloomberg

515304,StarBiz,2,15/02/2023,Artificial intelligence set to be the next tech pillar of investments,,"KUALA LUMPUR: More investments are poised to be poured into a relatively new space in the technology industry – artificial intelligence (AI).
 The potential winners of the development in this space would be technology suppliers and contractors that are listed in Malaysia.
 PublicInvest Research said AI could potentially revolutionise semiconductor manufacturing globally, moving forward.
 This as the growing influence of AI is poised to reshape industries from logistics, education and healthcare to automotive and manufacturing in the longer term, it said.
 “It is starting to look like 2023 may be the year when AI goes mainstream. Generative AI is a technology that uses machine learning to create new content, based on simple instruction,” the research house said.
 ChatGPT, which had been hogging the headlines of late, is one example of text-to-text Generative AI while there are also text-to-image, text or image-to-video, text-to-music and numerous other projects. 
 “Companies like ABB, Nvidia and Dynatrace are already developing AI applications to make industries like healthcare, education and manufacturing more efficient and responsive.
 “Furthermore, AI requires large amounts of data to be processed and high-performance hardware to train models. Digital data is currently growing at about 60% per annum, fuelling massive demand for cloud computing,” PublicInvest added.
 However, the generation of grammatically correct, human-like written text by AI applications can be used to make social engineering attacks such as phishing or business email, making scams harder to detect and remove.
 “As a result, corporate cybersecurity budgets will continue to rise. Gartner expects information security spending to reach US$187bil (RM813.17bil) as companies raise their outlay, including on AI-augmented security tools, to fend off new cyberattack tactics.
 “In short, the expansion in expenditure on AI, cloud and cybersecurity is expected to post strong earnings growth for the leading companies in these sectors,” it added.
 Meanwhile, according to Nikkei Asia, major US chip equipment suppliers are shifting operations from China to South-East Asia in a sign that US export controls enacted last October are accelerating the decoupling of tech supply chains between the world’s two largest economies. 
 “Applied Materials, Lam Research and KLS, which collectively own about 35% of the global market share for chip production equipment, have been increasing their production capacity in South-East Asia or relocating their workforce from China to Singapore and Malaysia since October,” PublicInvest said.
 It noted that the relocation of major semiconductor players to Malaysia will see more smaller global semiconductor companies following their footsteps. 
 PublicInvest said this move not only helps increase job orders for local players but will also widen the scope of the semiconductor value chain in Malaysia.
 “We think there will be more potential developments, especially in the front-end wafer fabrication and fabless deign fields, which can help widen Malaysia’s semiconductor value chain,” it said.",kuala lumpur investment poured space technology industry artificial intelligence potential winner development space technology supplier contractor malaysia publicinvest revolutionise semiconductor influence reshape industry logistics education healthcare automotive manufacturing term mainstream generative technology machine create content simple instruction house chatgpt headline late text text generative text image text image video text music numerous project company nvidia dynatrace application industry education manufacturing efficient responsive amount data performance hardware train model digital data annum massive demand cloud publicinvest generation correct human text application social engineering attack business email scam detect result corporate cybersecurity budget rise gartner security spending reach bil bil company security tool cyberattack tactic short expansion expenditure cloud cybersecurity post strong earnings growth company sector major chip equipment supplier operation south east asia sign export control tech supply chain largest economy material global market share chip production equipment production capacity east asia workforce china singapore malaysia publicinvest relocation major semiconductor player global semiconductor company publicinvest move job local player scope semiconductor chain malaysia potential development front fabrication fable deign field widen malaysia semiconductor chain,"[(0, 0.6438727), (2, 0.35193032)]",0
514784,StarBiz,4,13/02/2023,Tight job market? AI meets worker shortage,,"THE two investment obsessions of the year so far – artificial intelligence (AI) and super-tight labour markets – meet head on.
 If the hype about the former is to be believed, concern about the inflationary impact of the latter should be well wide of the mark. If only they were so perfectly aligned.
 Timing is everything of course. The speed with which ChatGPT-style AI tools zap swathes of white-collar desk jobs could be more glacial than any Big Tech rah-rah suggests – and at least slower than the 12-18 months of the Federal Reserve’s current policy horizon.
 But two reasonable questions are being asked around investment houses.
 Does the wave of layoffs in the digital and banking worlds this year relate directly to the presumed quantum leap in so-called generative AI – just as pandemic-related overstaffing and more recent job hoarding is being pared back?
 And if it does, should policymakers relax more about what could be temporary worker shortages in the service sector, where most of the wage and inflation concerns seem to centre?
 Far from relaxing, should office or home-based workers now fret that we’re in for anything but a tight jobs market over the coming years?
 More questions than answers perhaps – but enough to have investment strategists thinking laterally and joining dots.
 Morgan Stanley’s thematic research team said last week it was inundated with enquiries about generative AI during its recent client visits. 
 And while investment fads come and go, they said, this one is “worth considering seriously” given the speed of take-up and its diffusion across many industries.
 Aside from stock price and valuation frenzies, the team said a new wave of AI fed the debate about white-collar industry disruption in a “creative destruction moment” – with possible side benefits from reskilling workers to better wage diffusion.
 Citing numbers indicating employment in business, knowledge, customer and developer outsourcing in excess of 100 million across Asia alone, Morgan Stanley said the impact was already being felt even if the jury was still out on “the degree to which it is deflationary or productivity enhancing.”
 If this generative AI takes the tech transformation to non-routine office work that it largely skirted over the last decade, it will affect tens of millions more jobs than currently assumed.
 The two sides of the theoretical debate at least are whether that then leads to mass unemployment and demand problems –  requiring a reconsideration of things like universal basic income to support economies – or whether productivity gains lift wages and see workers simply choosing to work ever fewer hours over time as bots take their place.
 London-based Fathom Consulting last Thursday concluded that a “fourth industrial revolution powered by AI could greatly affect the demand for and supply of labour” and the United States and China were bound to vie for leadership.
 “The speed and impact of this change will be profoundly disruptive for global politics and for the structure of the labour market,” economists Erik Britton and Andrew Harris wrote, adding that the United States needed to keep investing in tech that both supports and replaces labour in order to retain its edge.
 But just what is the scale of the likely disruption?
 A frequently cited study by business consultant McKinsey from 2017 showed 60% of occupations worldwide have at least 30% of work activities that could be automated – even though automation may well create more jobs in tandem.
 That tallies with numbers from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which reckoned 10% to 15% of jobs will be lost due to tech changes over the next 20 years – but about as many may be created in other industries.
 While varying hugely among the 46 countries it examined, the McKinsey study said up to 30% of activities could be displaced by 2030 – with advanced and ageing economies more likely to move faster given higher wages and incentives.
 More recent polling from McKinsey last year showed companies saying at least a quarter of their tasks could be automated over the next five years but less than a fifth of respondents reckoned their firms were yet in a position to do that.
 And that observation underlines the timing of all this in terms of years. How soon do tech revolutions change the world – and at least aggregate demand or supply for workers?
 As the flub by Alphabet’s chatbot Bard illustrated in spectacular fashion this week, the big problem for the latest wave of emerging AI is still one of accuracy.
 “While ChatGPT’s output is credible, accuracy is its Achilles’ Heel,” Morgan Stanley’s team wrote. “Manual validation should act as a breakwater to this employment threat for now.”
 If creases take years to iron out, perhaps it’s not so useful to see the craze providing a timely offset to tight labour markets and wage inflation.
 There’s even a chance the trepidation may exaggerate the prevailing conundrum and cause as many problems as the reality.
 In a discussion paper published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research last month, economists Marta Golin and Christopher Rauh said their work found a “strong relationship” between worry about automation and intentions to join a union, retrain or switch occupations, preference for taxation and government handouts, populist attitudes and voting intentions.

514376,Life Inspired,18,12/02/2023,Revamp your home interior with AI,,"New technologies are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, not to mention our homes. Some of them, such as artificial intelligence, are even replacing interior designers when it comes to rethinking indoor spaces. All of which could revolutionise the sector. 
 From choosing the right colours and matching materials harmoniously to working with the shape and size of a room, successful interior design is an art that is much more complicated than it seems. It is sometimes difficult to imagine functional living spaces that reflect your tastes. But artificial intelligence is on hand to help. This technology is at the core of InteriorAI, a platform that generates interior design projects in a few clicks. 
 Users just have to upload a picture of the room they want to redesign to the InteriorAI website, then let the artificial intelligence guide them in the realisation of their project. However, the picture must be as bright as possible in order to facilitate the AI’s work. The artificial intelligence then generates a rendering of the room in question in about 20 interior design styles. 
 Want to turn your living room into an urban jungle? Or perhaps you prefer a more tropical style? And if you’re a compulsive collector, maybe you’d like your interior to reflect this aspect of your personality with a maximalist aesthetic. InteriorAI was created by a Dutch developer and entrepreneur known by the pseudonym “levelsio”, who is also the creator of “This House Does Not Exist”, another image generation tool. This one is able to produce pictures of modern houses from a line of text, based on a database that can include hundreds of millions of images from the internet.
 Several apps are using artificial intelligence to help anyone and everyone become a would-be interior designer. Ikea has used this same technology to launch its own app, called Place. It allows users to see which furniture from the Swedish firm’s catalog would look best in their home through augmented reality. It also provides them with “tips and recommendations based on curation, context and behaviour”, to help even the most indecisive of users to rethink their interior with minimal effort. – AFP Relaxnews",technology daily life mention home artificial intelligence interior designer indoor space sector choosing colour material size successful interior design art difficult imagine functional living space artificial intelligence hand technology core interiorai platform interior design project user upload picture redesign interiorai website artificial intelligence guide realisation project picture bright facilitate artificial intelligence generates question interior design style urban jungle tropical style compulsive collector interior reflect aspect personality maximalist aesthetic interiorai dutch developer entrepreneur pseudonym levelsio creator house exist image generation tool picture modern house database hundred million image apps artificial intelligence interior designer ikea technology launch app user furniture swedish firm catalog reality tip recommendation curation context behaviour indecisive user interior minimal effort afp relaxnews,"[(5, 0.99203295)]",5
514268,StarBiz 7,3,11/02/2023,"ChatGPT, the future of AI",New model poised to revolutionise industry,"IT used to be in the realm of science fiction, but is now a reality.
 Artificial intelligence (AI) has gone mainstream now with ChatGPT, and it is scaring and exciting a number of people and companies.
 The prospects of having AI solve tasks is thrilling. And it is sending the share prices of companies involved in AI skyrocketing.
 Several companies, such as BuzzFeed Inc, C3.ai Inc, SoundHound AI Inc, and BigBear.ai Holdings Inc, have experienced significant spikes in trading volume and dramatic fluctuations in their stock prices.
 The whole phenomenon is off the potential of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by AI research and deployment company OpenAI, with the support of Microsoft Corp’s multi-billion investment.
 ChatGPT, in other words, is an AI-powered language model that is trained from vast amounts of data from the Internet to answer prompts by users in a human-like manner, but limited now to data up to 2021.
 The traction it has garnered is staggering. As reported by Forbes, ChatGPT only took five days to achieve one million users compared to Facebook that took about 10 months, Netflix which took about three and a half years, and the iPhone that took about 74 days.
 Moreover, a report by investment bank UBS, citing an analysis by data firm Similarweb, showed that ChatGPT is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch.
 In comparison, data from application analysis firm Sensor Tower showed that TikTok took about nine months after its launch to reach 100 million users, while Instagram took more than two years.
 Worry for Google
 Anecdotally, ChatGPT usage has been able to aid students with their assignments or even help workers with their day-to-day job.
 The runaway success of ChatGPT prompted Google’s management to declare a state of emergency, or “code red,” in response to the launch of ChatGPT, owing to growing concerns regarding the future of the company’s search engine.
 Google’s search engine is its largest business, where a bulk of its revenue is derived from.
 The worries were fuelled by Microsoft’s announcement that it will integrate ChatGPT into Bing and Edge, the company’s search engine and browser, following its multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment deal with OpenAI in late-January.
 Acting promptly, just days ago, Google introduced Bard, a conversational AI service powered by a language model for dialogue applications or LaMDA in short.
 Bard has been unlatched for trusted testers ahead of making it more widely available to the public in the coming weeks.
 However, it couldn’t get any worse for Alphabet as it lost US$100bil (RM432bil) in market value, following inaccurate information shared by its new chatbot.
 The disruption ChatGPT can cause is multifaceted.
 ChatGPT has the ability to not only write codes for programming, but also debug codes, aiding software developers.
 Apart from writing articles or even crafting ideas for content creators, it is able to explain a complex topic or also write music in a desired genre as well.
 The extent of the ChatGPT’s capabilities, however, are yet to be fully uncovered but many reckon it is a game changer in the AI world.
 AI has been around but the level of AI in ChatGPT is said to be very high.
 In a recent article, consulting firm McKinsey and Company said generative AI, which is leveraged by ChatGPT or other chatbot, has been revolutionising assistive technology, reducing application development time, and bringing powerful capabilities to nontechnical users. 
 The big worry is that AI will impact jobs. 
 If you ask ChatGPT what will the impact on Malaysian jobs be, it says this: “ChatGPT, as an Al language model, has the potential to automate certain tasks and make some jobs more efficient. However, it is important to note that Al technology is not expected to fully replace human workers but rather augment and assist them.”
 In Malaysia, the impact of ChatGPT on jobs will likely depend on the specific industry and job function. 
 For example, in customer service, ChatGPT could be used to automate responses to frequently asked questions, freeing up customer service representatives to handle more complex inquiries. 
 On the other hand, in industries where creativity and human touch is important, ChatGPT is unlikely to replace human workers entirely. 
 It is important for workers and companies in Malaysia to continuously upskill and adapt to the changing technological landscape in order to remain relevant in the job market.”
 Speaking with consultants, different views were obtained, but the exact impact of ChatGPT on the Malaysian job market remains blurry.
  Deloitte South-East Asia consulting director Lee Yun-Han believes the chatbot has a high potential to disrupt how Malaysian businesses operate and how employees work. 
 Ernst & Young Consulting Sdn Bhd associate partner Yeap Bee Aik, on the other hand, says it is difficult to predict the exact impact of ChatGPT, or any AI technology, on Malaysia’s job market specifically. 
 “The decision to use AI or to leverage the workforce in a particular sector will depend on various factors such as the cost of labour, the availability of skilled workers, and the specific tasks and jobs that can be automated by AI,” Yeap says.
 Yeap opines that it is sensible for AI systems to perform repetitive tasks, as it can be performed more efficiently and accurately by AI as compared to humans, and consequently, leading to cost saving and increased productivity.
 However, Yeap adds that there are also tasks that may require human skills, such as creativity, empathy, and critical thinking, that may not be easily automated by AI. 
 “In short, the net impact of ChatGPT, or AI in general, on the Malaysian job market will depend on how it is integrated, the rate of adoption, and the actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals to help workers acquire new skills,” Yeap utters.
 Meanwhile, KPMG Malaysia head of technology consulting Alvin Gan believes the focus is more towards the scale of jobs being impacted.
 Gan believes the debates about jobs being affected by automation intensified in recent years as the country increased its focus on using automated systems.
 “To a large extent, there are parallels between the plausible impacts of ChatGPT with the technologies that had ‘arrived’ many years ago. Yes, ChatGPT is more intelligent and sophisticated compared to others – but the premise remains similar: automation and simplification of processes that have been used by humans for decades,” Gan notes.
 Gan believes the question that should be addressed is “how would business leaders resolve job displacement that is potentially caused by such AI models?”. 
 “One way to address this is by conditioning the workforce to understand that their jobs are likely to be redesigned,” Gan answers.
 Gan suggests that this exercise can be less painful if leaders can find ways to reallocate and retrain in a new era of breakthrough technologies that will likely complement existing roles and operations.
 “While job displacements will be inevitable in the short term, as with every technological revolution in the past, humans will adapt. I believe the jobs replaced by bots will give birth to new ones, and it will serve to complement the human workforce rather than replacing it completely,” Gan opines.
 When asked which industry will be affected the most by chatbots, Lee points out customer service, call centres, and copywriting sectors would likely be significantly disrupted by ChatGPT.
 However, Lee believes there are clear limitations to ChatGPT as it stands today.
 “It is unable to deliberately generate new knowledge, deliver creative responses with personality, or substitute human-to-human interaction,” Lee highlights.
 Yeap, meanwhile, believes ChatGPT will have some impact on all sectors, as language AI systems like ChatGPT have the potential to automate a wide range of tasks.
 However, having a similar opinion, Yeap opines the sectors that are most likely to be affected by AI technology are those that involve repetitive tasks that can be easily automated and these include data entry, customer service, and certain types of content creation.
 “Sectors that require higher-level cognitive skills, such as those in the medical, legal, and creative fields, are less likely to be impacted. This is because these jobs require human expertise and nuance, that AI technology like ChatGPT cannot fully replicate,” Yeap says.
 New jobs
 While some jobs may be displaced by AI technology, Yeap points out that new jobs will also be created in fields related to AI development and maintenance, data analysis, and digital transformation.
 “Therefore, the precise impact will likely vary from sector to sector, and it is important for organisations to carefully assess the potential benefits and risks of AI technology in their specific contexts,” Yeap concludes.
 While there are many advantages to utilising chatbots, Gan points out the downside of it.
 On an individual level, Gan believes overutilisation may create high dependency on this technology to perform tasks and obtain information, which in turn will impact one’s ability to think critically and rely on their own capabilities and skills.
 “On a broader level, there have already been reports of ChatGPT providing misinformation,” Gan reminds.
 Additionally, Gan says that the level of automation in Malaysia, as well as other developing countries, would ultimately result in structural transformation– an economic transition from low productivity and labour-intensive activities to higher productivity and skill-intensive activities. 
 “As Malaysia appears to be concentrated on labour-intensive manufacturing and service jobs, automation adoption would inevitably alter the nature of work and labour opportunities,” Gan says.
 Touching students’ assignments that are being done by ChatGPT in universities, Gan says it is imperative for educators to consider different ways of educating and designing their curriculum.
 “Assignments can be designed to demonstrate creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving. Skills for students to be able to adapt to future technologies and environments should be integrated into the curriculum,” Gan tells.
 He believes that the ball is now in the authorities’ court to ensure that their governance and the resiliency of student development are upheld in institutions.
 Explaining authorities’ role, Gan says policies on the use of AI tools should be established and communicated to students, with consequences for violators highlighted and enforced.
 “Additionally, higher education institutions should ensure constant awareness of the responsible and ethical use of AI, which impacts the integrity of the institution,” he adds.
 Lee believes that humanity needs to adapt to the never-ending technology advancements.
 “Just like how we have adopted the usage of calculators and the open-book approach in examinations and assignments, how universities evaluate their students would also need to evolve accordingly,” he says.
 While there are technologies that can detect the usage of AI in completing assignments, Lee thinks it is a constant game of catch-up as AI sophistication evolves.
 This view is echoed by Yeap, who also believes that universities should embrace AI and see it as an opportunity to enhance the learning experience and better prepare students for the future, rather than viewing AI as a threat.
 “Ultimately, universities will need to find a balance between promoting academic integrity and embracing new technologies that are shaping the future,” Yeap concludes.",realm science fiction reality

513820,StarBiz,11,10/02/2023,Salesforce’s  Bret Taylor  to start AI firm,,"NEW YORK: Bret Taylor, who recently resigned as co-chief executive officer at Salesforce Inc, is forming an artificial intelligence (AI) startup with outgoing Google vice-president Clay Bavor.
 The two executives, former colleagues at Alphabet Inc’s Google, will create a new company to apply AI to “some of the most important problems in business,” Taylor wrote yesterday in a LinkedIn post. 
 The venture will begin in March when Bavor leaves Google, that executive wrote in a separate post, and the pair will provide more details at a later date.
 Taylor, 42, once seen as a likely successor to Salesforce chief executive officer Marc Benioff, announced in November that he would leave the enterprise software giant to return to his “entrepreneurial roots.” 
 He helped found companies that were later purchased by Facebook Inc – now called Meta Platforms Inc – and Salesforce. 
 Since Taylor announced that he was leaving Salesforce, the company has embarked on significant job cuts, experienced a wave of executive turnover and been pressured by multiple activist investors. 
 Taylor had also been Twitter Inc’s board chairman, serving as the social media company’s point person during Elon Musk’s acquisition.
 Bavor, who joined Google in 2005, rose in the company’s ranks as a manager on Gmail and Google Drive and is considered a favourite lieutenant of CEO Sundar Pichai. 
 In 2015, Bavor was tapped to run Google’s virtual reality (VR) unit, an effort to outpace rivals to the next expected computing platform.
 Google has released waves of software and some gadgets, but its products have never gained widespread use and the company has retreated from the field.
 In 2021, Bavor was put in charge of a new Google division called Labs that housed various far-flung projects, including VR and blockchain and the company’s startup incubator. The incubator, called Area 120, was pared back significantly in a recent wave of job cuts at Alphabet.

513378,StarBiz,10,09/02/2023,Retail investors flock to small-cap AI firms,,"NEW YORK: Retail investors are piling into small-cap firms that are building artificial intelligence (AI) tools as companies, including Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, jostle to pull ahead in the race for the next big growth driver.
 The viral success of ChatGPT has turned the spotlight on AI on Wall Street, reminiscent of the blockchain hype from a few years ago when shares of companies remotely associated with the technology surged.
 As per Vanda Research, the US$3bil (RM12.9bil) AI software firm C3.ai was the fifth most actively traded on Fidelity’s platform for small investors on Monday, drawing record daily retail inflows worth US$31.4mil (RM135mil).
 The stock fell 14.7% on Tuesday, although it is up about 140% so far this year.
 “Small-cap firms have AI as a much larger part of their business than the larger ones,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital Management, on the reason behind retail investors’ focus on the smaller firms.
 Tuttle said he had shorted C3.ai shares about a week ago but was looking to switch to the long side because “that’s where the action is”.
 Shares of SoundHound AI, which offers voice AI platform services, and Thailand’s security firm Guardforce AI have more than doubled in value so far this year, while those of analytics firm BigBear.ai have seen a nine-fold rise.
 SoundHound AI was last down about 14.9% and BigBear.ai fell 18%, while Guardforce AI slipped 3%.
 Shares of Microsoft, which backs ChatGPT parent OpenAI, gained about 2.4% after the tech giant said it was revamping its Bing search engine with AI such that users will be able to chat with the search engine naturally.
 The new Bing chatbot will help users refine queries and even draft and translate emails, with the company calling Bing the “AI-powered robot for the web”.
 Alphabet said on Monday it would launch a chatbot service called Bard along with more AI tools to power its search engine.
 Microsoft is in a strong position in the AI race due to the combination of its close partnership with OpenAI and its Azure capabilities around compute and data, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said.
 “If you’re investing in AI, you should consider the fact that these smaller companies are competing against Goliath, and Goliath has the scale, efficiency and capital to own the space,” eToro analyst Callie Cox said, adding there has been a lot of interest in AI lately.
 US-listed shares of Baidu Inc climbed 9.9% on Tuesday after the Chinese search engine said it would complete internal testing of a ChatGPT-style project called “Ernie Bot” in March. Earlier in the day, a clutch of Chinese AI stocks had also rallied.
 “The market is right now trying to search for what would be the next big thing that’s going to lead markets over the next 10 years, and AI is that,” said Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at Alpine Macro.

512926,StarBiz,8,08/02/2023,Tech giants explore  new AI opportunities,"Despite advances, there’s still a ‘long way’ to go","SHANGHAI: Chinese tech companies are upping the ante in the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content sector as ChatGPT, the latest chatbot launched by US-based artificial intelligence research company OpenAI, gains wide popularity since its November debut and revolutionises the field due to its advanced conversational capabilities.
 Leveraging machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT is able to mimic humanlike responses with AI-generated content (AIGC) and assist people with tasks such as writing essays and scripts, making business proposals and even checking programme bugs, which it does within seconds.
 AIGC-related stocks continued to rally in the A-share market, with Chinese AI companies, such as Cloudwalk Technology and Speechocean, seeing their shares surge by the daily limit of 20% on the science and technology innovation board on Monday.
 Experts said that AIGC is likely to become a new engine driving innovation in digital content production and freeing human creators from tedious tasks, with a wide range of commercial applications in fields such as culture, media, entertainment and education.
 Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc announced yesterday that it will complete internal testing of its AI chatbot service, similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, called “Ernie Bot” in March.
 The Beijing-based company has invested large sums of money in developing its Ernie system, a large-scale machine-learning model that has been trained on massive data over several years and possesses in-depth semantic comprehension and generation capabilities.
 Robin Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of Baidu, said in January that AIGC will subvert existing content production models in the next decade, and AI has the potential to meet massive demand for content at a 10th of the cost and a hundred or thousand times faster.
 Jianying, an AI-powered short-video editing app launched by Chinese tech company Byte-Dance, allows users to generate creative videos by simply putting in a few keywords or a paragraph of text.
 Online gaming company Net-Ease has released its AI music creation platform, Tianyin, where users can customise a song by entering lyrics.
 Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Centre at Zhejiang University’s International Business School, said that ChatGPT, as a milestone in AIGC-related technologies, uses reinforcement learning from human feedback to train the data model, with significant enhancements in natural language processing capacities that improve the logic of responses.
 Chinese enterprises should step up efforts to roll out indigenous versions of the AI-powered chatbot and increase investments to improve related algorithms and computing power, Pan said.
 Chen Jia, an independent strategy analyst, said: “Chinese tech enterprises have unique advantages in expanding AI application scenarios globally.”
 China has made significant progress in developing the AI industry.
 A Stanford University report showed that China filed more than half the world’s AI patent applications in 2021 and continued to lead the world in the number of AI journals, conference papers and related publications.
 Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have invested heavily in promoting the commercial use of AI, and some Chinese AI unicorns have grown rapidly in recent years, Chen said.
 But he noted that Chinese tech companies lag behind top-notch foreign competitors in fundamental research and development input and comprehensive innovation abilities.
 “AIGC is in the initial stage of development, and there is still a long way to go to realise large-scale commercialisation, as the application scenarios and related laws and regulations are far from mature,” said Guo Tao, deputy head of the China Electronic Commerce Expert Service Centre. 
 Meanwhile, the use of AIGC-related technologies raises concerns about ethics, copyright protection and privacy, he added.— China Daily/ANN",shanghai chinese tech company ante artificial intelligence content sector chatgpt chatbot artificial intelligence company openai gain wide popularity debut field conversational capability machine algorithm chatgpt mimic humanlike response content aigc assist people task essay script business proposal programme bug stock share market chinese company technology speechocean share daily limit science technology innovation board monday expert engine innovation digital content production human creator tedious task wide commercial application field culture medium entertainment education chinese tech baidu yesterday complete internal testing chatbot service openai chatgpt ernie bot march company sum money ernie system scale machine model massive data posse semantic comprehension generation capability founder chief executive officer january aigc subvert content production model decade potential meet massive demand content cost time short video chinese tech company byte dance user creative video keywords paragraph text online company net ease music creation platform tianyin user song lyric pan director digital economy financial innovation centre zhejiang university international business school chatgpt milestone aigc technology human feedback train data model enhancement natural language processing capacity logic response chinese enterprise step effort indigenous version chatbot increase investment power pan jia independent strategy analyst chinese tech enterprise unique advantage application scenario progress industry stanford university report china half patent application lead journal conference paper publication tencent alibaba commercial chinese unicorn chen chinese tech company top notch foreign competitor fundamental development input comprehensive innovation ability initial stage development scale commercialisation application scenario law regulation guo tao deputy head china electronic commerce expert service centre aigc technology concern ethic copyright protection privacy china daily ann,"[(2, 0.6165195), (3, 0.38053903)]",2
512152,StarEdu,7,05/02/2023,Time to embrace AI,"Rethink teaching, learning, student assessment to safeguard academic integrity","AN artificial intelligence (AI) system that can write essays, solve mathematical problems, generate computer code, hold a chat conversation, and even crack jokes seems hard to imagine, but that is what ChatGPT, a groundbreaking new AI-driven chatbot developed by research company OpenAI, does.
 Accessible to the public since November last year, anyone can sign up and start using ChatGPT right away, which was what I did. Here is an excerpt of what ChatGPT produced when I asked to write an article for me on the topic of AI in higher education: 
 “One of the main benefits of AI in higher education is the ability to personalise the learning experience. AI can analyse a student’s performance and provide tailored feedback and recommendations for improvement. This can help students learn at their own pace and reduce the workload for instructors. AI is also being used to create virtual assistants and tutors that can answer questions and provide support to students. These tools can help students learn more efficiently and effectively, and they can be accessed anytime and anywhere with an Internet connection.”
 It’s scarily impressive, and it’s impossible to distinguish whether the text was written by a human or AI. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology that ChatGPT is based on is smart enough to string together meaningful sentences in a matter of seconds. What’s special about ChatGPT is its seeming ability to exhibit creativity – a quality that was earlier thought to be beyond AI.
 Some argue that ChatGPT will eventually replace Google search and become the de facto way in which people get information. The fact that OpenAI is founded by Tesla mogul Elon Musk and funded by the likes of tech giant Microsoft gives some weight to that argument.
 As an educator, alarm bells are starting to ring in my head. I have no way to tell whether assignments submitted by my students are written by them or an AI system like ChatGPT. 
 The Guardian, in its article “AI bot ChatGPT stuns academics with essay-writing skills and usability”, reported that ChatGPT generated answers to exam queries that would have been given full marks by examiners if submitted by a student. It’s also been reported that ChatGPT was able to pass an MBA exam, a US Medical Licensing Exam, and the US Bar Exam to practise law. Universities should be seriously worried.
 Cheating and issues relating to academic integrity are nothing new. Even before AI came along, technology made cheating, plagiarism, collusion, and other unwarranted behaviours as simple as cutting and pasting. 
 Notably, the widespread adoption of plagiarism detection tools such as Turnitin by many universities has proven to be an ineffective deterrent. The article “One in 10 uni students submit assignments written by someone else – and most are getting away with it” in The Conversation suggests that 10% of students engage in some form of cheating, and that 95% of those who cheat are never caught.
 With AI, the chance of catching cheaters will be even slimmer, and the temptation to cheat even greater. Contract cheating, where students pay external companies to ghostwrite essays, is already a systemic problem.
 Those students can now get ChatGPT to effectively ghostwrite for free. The big question is how will universities maintain academic integrity in the face of rapid advancements in AI? Universities are delusional to think they can fight AI by investing in more advanced AI. Nor can universities sidestep the problem by “trusting” their students under the defence of an honour code.
 The short, and possibly only, answer when it comes to student assessment is to rely less on the “digital” and more on the ‘physical’. Think of students sitting for exams in a physical exam hall rather than remotely online. Or students discussing their work before a live classroom audience, responding to questions on the spot. Or students presenting a highly personalised portfolio based on their own experience rather than a generic assignment.
 AI is here to stay and can only get smarter. And it’s not just about ChatGPT – there is a plethora of generative AI tools flooding the Internet. 
 Universities need to embrace the fact that we are living in an AI-inclusive world.
 Educators should rethink how they approach teaching, learning and student assessment to take advantage of what AI offers, but at the same time protect academic integrity to ensure that student learning outcomes are not compromised.

510002,Lifestyle,6,30/01/2023,"AI,  do my homework!","This is how ChatGPT,  an artificial intelligence chatbot, pits teachers against tech.","KNOW-IT-ALL chatbots landed with a bang last year, convincing one engineer that machines had become sentient, spreading panic that industries could be wiped out, and creating fear of a cheating epidemic in schools and universities.
 Alarm among educators has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks over ChatGPT, an easy-to-use artificial intelligence (AI) tool trained on billions of words and a ton of data from the Web.
 It can write a half-decent essay and answer many common classroom questions, sparking a fierce debate about the very future of traditional education.
 In the United States, New York City’s education department banned ChatGPT on its networks because of “concerns about negative impacts on student learning”.
 “While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical- thinking and problem-solving skills,” said the department’s Jenna Lyle.A group of Australian universities said they would change exam formats to banish AI tools, regarding them as straight-up cheating.
 However, some in the education sector are more relaxed about AI tools in the classroom, and some even sense an opportunity rather than a threat.
 ‘Important innovation’
 That is partly because ChatGPT in its current form still gets stuff wrong. To give one example, Guatemala is bigger than Honduras. It isn’t.
 Also, ambiguous questions can throw it off track.
 Ask the tool to describe the Battle of Amiens and it will give a passable detail or two on the 1918 confrontation from World War I.
 But it does not flag that there was also a skirmish of the same name in 1870. It takes several prompts for it to realise its error. 
 “ChatGPT is an important innovation, but no more so than calculators or text editors,” said French author and educator Antonio Casilli.
 “ChatGPT can help people who are stressed by a blank sheet of paper to write a first draft, but afterwards they still have to write and give it a style.”
 Researcher Olivier Ertzscheid from the University of Nantes agreed that teachers should be focusing on the positives.
 In any case, he said, high school students were already using ChatGPT, and any attempt to ban it would just make it more appealing.
 Teachers should instead “experiment with the limits” of AI tools, he said, by generating texts themselves and analysing the results with their students.
 ‘Humans deserve to know’
 But there is also another big reason to think that educators do not need to panic yet.
 AI writing tools have long been locked in an arms race with programs that seek to sniff them out, and ChatGPT is no different.
 Recently, an amateur programmer announced he had spent his new year’s holiday creating an app that could analyse texts and decide if they were written by ChatGPT.
 “There’s so much ChatGPT hype going around,” Edward Tian wrote on Twitter.
 “Are this and that written by AI? We as humans deserve to know!”
 His app, GPTZero, is not the first in the field and is unlikely to be the last.
 Universities already use software that detects plagiarism, so it does not take a huge leap of imagination to see a future where each essay is rammed through an AI-detector.
 Campaigners are also floating the idea of digital watermarks or other forms of signifiers that will identify AI work.
 And OpenAI, the company that owns ChatGPT, said it was already working on a “statistical watermark” prototype.
 This suggests that educators will be fine in the long run.
 But Casilli, for one, still believes the impact of such tools has a huge symbolic significance.
 It partly upended the rules of the game, whereby teachers ask their pupils questions, he said.
 Now, the student questions the machine before checking everything in the output.
 “Every time new tools appear, we start to worry about potential abuses, but we have also found ways to use them in our teaching,” said Casilli. – AFP",chatbots bang engineer machine panic industry fear epidemic school university educator pitch week easy artificial intelligence tool billion ton data write half decent essay answer common classroom question fierce debate future traditional education united york city education department chatgpt network concern negative impact student tool quick easy answer question critical thinking skill department jenna lyle australian university exam format banish tool education sector tool classroom sense opportunity threat innovation chatgpt current form stuff wrong guatemala bigger honduras ambiguous question track tool battle passable detail confrontation war flag skirmish prompt error chatgpt innovation calculator text editor french author educator antonio casilli chatgpt people blank sheet paper write draft write style researcher olivier ertzscheid university nantes teacher positive school student attempt ban teacher experiment limit tool text student human reason educator writing tool arm race program sniff chatgpt amateur programmer spent holiday app analyse text chatgpt chatgpt hype edward tian human app gptzero field university software plagiarism huge leap imagination future essay detector campaigner idea digital watermark signifier openai company chatgpt statistical watermark prototype educator fine casilli impact tool huge symbolic significance rule game teacher question student question machine output time tool potential abuse casilli afp,"[(1, 0.99541694)]",1
509158,Lifestyle,9,27/01/2023,Fighting back against AI,"AI tools can create new images and artworks, but who is the real artist?","COUNTLESS artists have taken inspiration from The Starry Night since Vincent Van Gogh painted the swirling scene in 1889.
 Now artificial intelligence systems are doing the same, training themselves on a vast collection of digitised artworks to produce new images you can conjure in seconds from a smartphone app.
 The images generated by tools such as DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion can be weird and otherworldly but also increasingly realistic and customisable – ask for a “peacock owl in the style of Van Gogh” and they can churn out something that might look similar to what you imagined.
 But while Van Gogh and other long-dead master painters aren’t complaining, some living artists and photographers are starting to fight back against the AI software companies creating images derived from their works.
 Two new lawsuits – one from the Seattle-based photography giant Getty Images – take aim at popular image-generating services for allegedly copying and processing millions of copyright-protected images without a license.
 Getty said it has begun legal proceedings in the High Court of Justice in London against Stability AI – the maker of Stable Diffusion – for infringing intellectual property rights to benefit the London-based startup’s commercial interests.
 Another lawsuit in a US federal court in San Francisco describes AI image-generators as “21st-century collage tools that violate the rights of millions of artists”. 
 The lawsuit, filed on Jan 13 by three working artists on behalf of others like them, also names Stability AI as a defendant, along with San Francisco-based image-generator startup Midjourney, and the online gallery DeviantArt.
 The lawsuit alleges that AI-generated images “compete in the marketplace with the original images. Until now, when a purchaser seeks a new image ‘in the style’ of a given artist, they must pay to commission or license an original image from that artist”.
 Companies that provide image-generating services typically charge users a fee. 
 After a free trial of Midjourney through the chatting app Discord, for instance, users must buy a subscription that starts at US$10 (RM43) per month or up to US$600 (RM2,556) a year for corporate memberships. The startup OpenAI also charges for use of its DALL-E image generator, and StabilityAI offers a paid service called DreamStudio.
 Stability AI said in a statement that “Anyone that believes that this isn’t fair use does not understand the technology and misunderstands the law”.
 In a December interview, before the lawsuits were filed, Midjourney CEO David Holz described his image-making service as “kind of like a search engine” pulling in a wide swath of images from across the Internet. He compared copyright concerns about the technology with how such laws have adapted to human creativity.
 “Can a person look at somebody else’s picture and learn from it and make a similar picture?” Holz said. 
 “Obviously, it’s allowed for people and if it wasn’t, then it would destroy the whole professional art industry, probably the nonprofessional industry too. To the extent that AIs are learning like people, it’s sort of the same thing and if the images come out differently then it seems like it’s fine.”
 The copyright disputes mark the beginning of a backlash against a new generation of impressive tools – some of them introduced just last year – that can generate new visual media, readable text and computer code on command.
 They also raise broader concerns about the propensity of AI tools to amplify misinformation or cause other harm. For AI image generators, that includes the creation of nonconsensual sexual imagery.
 Some systems produce photorealistic images that can be impossible to trace, making it difficult to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s AI. 
 And while some have safeguards in place to block offensive or harmful content, experts fear it’s only a matter of time until people utilise these tools to spread disinformation and further erode public trust.
 “Once we lose this capability of telling what’s real and what’s fake, everything will suddenly become fake because you lose confidence of anything and everything,” said Wael Abd-Almageed, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Southern California.
 As a test, the AP submitted a text prompt on Stable Diffusion featuring the keywords “Ukraine war” and “Getty Images”. 
 The tool created photo-like images of soldiers in combat with warped faces and hands, pointing and carrying guns. Some of the images also featured the Getty watermark, but with garbled text.
 AI can also get things wrong, like feet and fingers or details on ears that can sometimes give away that they’re not real, but there’s no set pattern to look out for. Those visual clues can also be edited. On Midjourney, users often post on the Discord chat asking for advice on how to fix distorted faces and hands.
 With some generated images travelling on social networks and potentially going viral, they can be challenging to debunk since they can’t be traced back to a specific tool or data source, according to Chirag Shah, a professor at the Information School at the University of Washington, who uses these tools for research.
 “You could make some guesses if you have enough experience working with these tools,” Shah said. “But beyond that, there is no easy or scientific way to really do this.”
 For all the backlash, there are many people who embrace the new AI tools and the creativity they unleash. Some use them as a hobby to create intricate landscapes, portraits and art; others to brainstorm marketing materials, video game scenery or other ideas related to their professions.
 There’s plenty of room for fear, but “what can else can we do with them?” asked the artist Refik Anadol recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he displayed an exhibit of climate-themed work created by training AI models on a trove of publicly available images of coral.
 At the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Anadol designed Unsupervised, which draws from artworks in the museum’s prestigious collection – including The Starry Night – and feeds them into a digital installation generating animations of mesmerising colours and shapes in the museum lobby.
 The installation is “constantly changing, evolving and dreaming 138,000 old artworks at MoMA’s archive”, said Anadol. 
 “From Van Gogh to Picasso to Kandinsky, incredible, inspiring artists who defined and pioneered different techniques exist in this artwork, in this AI dream world.”
 Anadol, who builds his own AI models, said in an interview that he prefers to look at the bright side of the technology. But he hopes future commercial applications can be fine-tuned so artists can more easily opt out.
 “I totally hear and agree that certain artists or creators are very uncomfortable about their work being used,” he said.
 For painter Erin Hanson, whose impressionist landscapes are so popular and easy to find online that she has seen their influence in AI-produced visuals, the concern is not about her own prolific output, which makes US$3mil (RM13mil) a year.
 She does, however, worry about the art community as a whole.
 “The original artist needs to be acknowledged in some way or compensated,” said Hanson. 
 “That’s what copyright laws are all about. And if artists aren’t acknowledged, then it’s going to make it hard for artists to make a living in the future.” – AP",countless artist inspiration night vincent van gogh scene artificial intelligence system vast collection artwork image smartphone app image tool dall midjourney stable diffusion weird realistic customisable peacock owl style van gogh churn van gogh dead master painter living artist photographer fight software company image lawsuit seattle photography giant getty image popular image service million image getty legal proceeding court justice london stability maker stable diffusion intellectual property right london startup commercial lawsuit federal court francisco describes image generator century collage tool violate right million artist lawsuit jan artist name stability defendant san francisco image generator midjourney online gallery deviantart lawsuit image marketplace original image seek image style artist pay commission license original image artist company image generating service user free trial midjourney app discord instance user subscription start month corporate membership openai charge image generator stabilityai offer service dreamstudio stability statement fair understand technology law december interview lawsuit midjourney ceo david holz image service search engine wide swath image copyright concern technology law human creativity person picture learn picture holz people professional art industry nonprofessional industry extent people sort image copyright dispute backlash generation impressive tool generate visual medium readable text computer code command broader concern propensity tool misinformation harm image generator creation nonconsensual sexual imagery system photorealistic image impossible trace difficult difference real safeguard offensive harmful content expert matter time people tool spread disinformation public trust lose capability real fake lose confidence wael almageed professor electrical computer engineering university southern california test text prompt stable diffusion keywords ukraine war getty photo soldier combat hand gun image getty watermark text wrong foot finger detail ear real set pattern visual clue midjourney user discord chat advice hand image social network viral debunk specific tool data source chirag shah professor school university washington guess experience tool easy scientific backlash people tool creativity hobby create intricate landscape portrait brainstorm marketing material game scenery idea profession fear artist refik anadol economic forum davos switzerland exhibit climate created training model coral museum modern art york anadol unsupervised draw artwork prestigious collection starry night feed digital installation animation colour shape lobby installation artwork archive anadol van gogh picasso kandinsky incredible inspiring artist pioneered technique artwork dream anadol model interview prefers technology future commercial application artist hear agree artist creator uncomfortable painter erin hanson impressionist popular easy online influence visuals concern prolific output mil community original artist compensated hanson law artist hard artist future,"[(2, 0.22936386), (3, 0.76870614)]",3
507062,Main,22,19/01/2023,Getty Images targets AI firm for ‘copying’ photos,,"Paris: US firm Getty Images threa­tened to sue a tech company it accuses of illegally copying millions of photos for use in an artificial intelligence (AI) art tool.
 Getty, which distributes stock images and news photos including those of AFP, accused Stability AI of profiting from its pictures and those of its partners.
 Stability AI runs a tool called Stable Diffusion that allows users to generate mash-up images from a few words of text, but the firm uses material it scrapes from the web often without permission.
 The question of copyright is still in dispute, with creators and artists arguing that the tools infringe their intellectual property and AI firms claiming they are protected under “fair use” rules.
 Tools like Stable Diffusion and Dall-E 2 exploded in popularity last year, quickly becoming a global sensation with absurd images in the style of famous artists flooding social media.
 But the increased visibility also attracted the attention of artists, photographers, other creators and their lawyers.
 Stability AI is already facing a class action lawsuit in the United States, launched last week by three artists who claim their copyright has been infringed.
 “It is Getty Images’ position that Stability AI unlawfully copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright,” the firm said in a statement.
 The photo firm said it had provided licences tailored to firms that wanted to train AI models.
 “Stability AI did not seek any such license from Getty Images and instead, we believe, chose to ignore viable licensing options and long-standing legal protections in pursuit of their standalone commercial interests.” — AFP",paris firm getty image sue tech company million artificial intelligence art tool getty stock image news photo afp stability picture partner stability tool stable diffusion user mash image text firm material scrape web permission question dispute creator tool intellectual property firm protected fair rule stable diffusion dall popularity global sensation absurd image style famous artist social medium visibility attention photographer creator lawyer stability class action lawsuit launched week artist copyright getty image position stability million image copyright firm statement photo firm licence tailored firm model stability seek license getty image viable licensing option legal protection standalone commercial afp,"[(3, 0.9906474)]",3
500306,StarBiz,8,03/01/2023,AI infused everything                on display at CES,Show-goers hope for a return of packed halls,"San Francisco: The latest leaps in artificial intelligence (AI) in everything from cars, robots to appliances will be on full display at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opening Thursday in Las Vegas.
 Forced by the pandemic to go virtual in 2021 and hybrid last year, tens of thousands of show-goers are hoping for a return to packed halls and rapid-fire deal-making that were long the hallmark of the annual gadget extravaganza.
 “In 2022, it was a shadow of itself – empty halls, no meetings in hotel rooms,” Avi Greengart, an analyst at Techspotential told AFP.
 “Now, (we expect) crowds, trouble getting around and meetings behind closed doors –which is what a trade show is all about.”
 The CES show officially opens on Jan 5, but companies will begin to vie for the spotlight with the latest tech wizardry as early as today.
 CES will be spread over more than 18 acres, from the sprawling Las Vegas Convention Centre to pavilions set up in parking lots. 
 Ballrooms and banquet rooms across Sin City will be used to hustle up business.
 With transportation now computing’s new frontier, next generation autos, trucks, boats, farm equipment, and even flying machines are expected to grab attention, say analysts.
 “It’s going to feel almost like you’re at an auto show,” said Kevan Yalowitz, head of platform strategy at Accenture.
 More than ever, cars now come with operating systems so much like a smartphone or laptop computer, Accenture expects that by 2040 about 40% of vehicles on the road will need software updated remotely.
 And with connected cars come apps and online entertainment as developers battle to grab passenger attention with streaming or shopping services on board.
 Electric vehicles enhanced with AI will also be on display “in a big way,” Greengart said.
 “What has really been the buzz is personalised flying machines,” said independent tech analyst Rob Enderle.
 “Basically, they are human-carrying drones.”
 Gadgets or services pitched as being part of the next-generation of the Internet – or “Web 3” – are also expected to include mixed reality gear as well as blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens.
 Web 3 promises a more decentralised Internet where tech giants, big business or governments no longer hold all the keys to life online.

499906,Lifestyle,3,02/01/2023,Laying down the law on AI,,"FROM “intelligent” vacuum cleaners and driverless cars to advanced techniques for diagnosing diseases, artificial intelligence has burrowed its way into every arena of modern life.
 Its promoters reckon it is revolutionising the human experience, but critics stress that the technology risks putting machines in charge of life-changing decisions.Regulators in Europe and North America are worried.
 The European Union is likely to pass legislation this year – the AI Act – aimed at reining in the age of the algorithm.
 The United States recently published a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and Canada is also mulling legislation.
 China’s use of biometric data, facial recognition, and other technology to build a powerful control system has loomed large in the debates.
 Gry Hasselbalch, a Danish academic who advises the EU on the controversial technology, argued that the West was also in danger of creating “totalitarian infrastructures”.
 “I see that as a huge threat, no matter the benefits,” she said.
 But before regulators can act, they face the daunting task of defining what AI actually is.
 ‘Mug’s game’
 Suresh Venkatasubramanian of Brown University, who co- authored the AI Bill of Rights, said trying to define AI was “a mug’s game”.
 Any technology that affects people’s rights should be within the scope of the bill, he tweeted.
 The 27-nation EU is taking the more tortuous route of attempting to define the sprawling field.
 Its draft law lists the kinds of approaches defined as AI, and it includes pretty much any computer system that involves automation.
 The problem stems from the changing use of the term AI.
 For decades, it described attempts to create machines that simulated human thinking.
 But funding largely dried up for this research – known as symbolic AI – in the early 2000s.
 The rise of the Silicon Valley titans saw AI reborn as a catch-all label for their number- crunching programs and the algorithms they generated.
 This automation allowed them to target users with advertising and content, helping them to make hundreds of billions of dollars.
 “AI was a way for them to make more use of this surveillance data and to mystify what was happening,” Meredith Whittaker, a former Google worker who co-founded New York University’s AI Now Institute, said.
 So, the EU and US have both concluded that any definition of AI needs to be as broad as possible.
 ‘Too challenging’
 But from that point, the two Western powerhouses have largely gone their separate ways.
 The EU’s draft AI Act runs to more than 100 pages.
 Among its most eye-catching proposals are the complete prohibition of certain “high-risk” technologies – the kind of biometric surveillance tools used in some countries.
 It also drastically limits the use of AI tools by migration officials, police and judges.
 Hasselbalch said some technologies were “simply too challenging to fundamental rights”.
 The AI Bill of Rights, on the other hand, is a brief set of principles framed in aspirational language, with exhortations like “you should be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems”.
 The bill was issued by the White House and relies on existing law.
 Because Congress is deadlocked, experts believe no dedicated AI legislation will be enacted in the United States until at least 2024.
 ‘Flesh wound’
 Opinions differ on the merits of each approach.
 “We desperately need regulation,” said Gary Marcus of New York University.
 He points out that “large language models” – the AI behind chatbots, translation tools, predictive text software and much else – can be used to generate harmful disinformation.
 Whittaker questioned the value of laws aimed at tackling AI rather than the “surveillance business models” that underpin it.“If you’re not addressing that at a fundamental level, I think you’re putting a band-aid over a flesh wound,” she said.
 But other experts have broadly welcomed the US approach.
 AI was a better target for regulators than the more abstract concept of privacy, said Sean McGregor, a researcher who chronicles tech failures for the AI Incident Database.
 But he said there could be a risk of over-regulation.
 “The authorities that exist can regulate AI,” he said, pointing to the likes of the US Federal Trade Commission and the housing regulator HUD.
 But where experts broadly agree is on the need to remove the hype and mysticism that surrounds AI technology.
 “It’s not magical,” McGregor said, likening AI to a highly sophisticated Excel spreadsheet. – AFP",intelligent vacuum cleaner driverless car technique disease artificial intelligence arena modern life promoter human experience critic stress technology risk machine charge life decision regulator worried european union pas legislation age algorithm blueprint bill right legislation china biometric data facial recognition technology powerful control system debate gry hasselbalch danish academic advises controversial technology west danger totalitarian infrastructure huge threat matter benefit regulator task game suresh venkatasubramanian brown university bill right game technology people right bill nation tortuous route define sprawling field draft law kind approach computer system automation term decade attempt machine human funding symbolic rise silicon valley titan reborn catch label program automation target user content hundred billion dollar surveillance data meredith whittaker google worker york university institute definition broad western powerhouse draft eye proposal complete prohibition risk technology biometric surveillance tool country limit tool migration official judge technology fundamental right bill right hand principle aspirational language exhortation unsafe ineffective system bill white house law congress expert legislation united flesh wound opinion merit regulation gary marcus york university language model chatbots translation tool predictive text software generate harmful disinformation whittaker law surveillance business model fundamental level band aid flesh wound expert approach target regulator concept privacy sean mcgregor researcher chronicle tech failure incident database risk regulation authority regulate federal trade commission housing regulator hud expert hype mysticism technology magical mcgregor sophisticated excel spreadsheet afp,"[(1, 0.9958406)]",1

 The work, due to go under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London next month, is described as a “haunting” portrait of the English mathematician Alan Turing, considered one of the fathers of modern computing.
 Entitled AI God, the 2.2m-high portrait is expected to fetch between £100,000 and £150,000 (RM562,435 and RM843,653).
 The online sale, featuring a range of digital art forms, would explore the intersection between art and technology, according to Sotheby’s.
 The ultra-realistic robot is designed to resemble a human female with a face, large eyes and a brown wig, and is one of the most advanced in the world.
 It works by using AI algorithms and has cameras in its eyes and bionic hands.
 Aidan Meller, gallery owner and founder of Ai-Da Robot studio, led the team that created it with artificial intelligence specialists at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham in England.
 Meller said Turing, who made his name as a World War II codebreaker, mathematician and early computer scientist, had raised concerns about the use of AI in the 1950s.
 The artwork’s “muted tones and broken facial planes” seemingly suggested “the struggles Turing warned we will face when it comes to managing AI”, he said.
 Ai-Da’s works were “ethereal and haunting” and “continue to question where the power of AI will take us, and the global race to harness its power”, he added.

 These partnerships are a “critical enabler” of the republic’s manufacturing ambitions, noted Heng in a speech on Monday.
 “Such partnerships allow us to develop our respective strengths and support one another in navigating some of the difficult adjustments that come with transformation,” he said at the opening ceremony of the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific 2024 event. 
 This comes as Singapore remains on track to achieve its goal of increasing manufacturing value-added by 50% between 2020 and 2030, and positioning itself as a critical node for advanced manufacturing.
 At the event at the Singapore Expo, themed “Shaping a Sustainable Future with AI-Powered Manufacturing”, Heng said that the manufacturing sector globally accounts for around one fifth of global carbon emissions, so it is critical that the sector contributes and uses new green and sustainable solutions to boost global efforts to combat climate change.
 Another key trend will be the transformative impact of AI on the sector, which accounts for around 20% of Singapore’s gross domestic product.
 In his speech, Heng announced several initiatives and outlined ways local and overseas organisations can collaborate with the local manufacturing ecosystem.
 For example, Singapore and its partners have to work together to broaden platforms that translate scientific insights into “practical, innovative and viable” solutions. 
 To that end, the Advanced Manufacturing Centre of Innovation was launched on Monday by Enterprise Singapore, in collaboration with A*Star’s Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology and four polytechnics – Nanyang, Ngee Ann, Singapore and Temasek.
 The centre aims to support more than 800 local companies from the advanced-manufacturing sector over the next two years, in more than 100 joint innovation projects to generate new revenue streams.

740873,StarBiz,11,16/10/2024,US to weigh further  crackdown on  AI chip exports,,"WASHINGTON: Biden administration officials have discussed capping sales of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips from Nvidia Corp and other American companies on a country-specific basis, people familiar with the matter say.
 The new approach would set a ceiling on export licences for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who spoke about the private discussions on condition of anonymity. 
 Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centres and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.
 Deliberations are in the early stages and remain fluid, the people said, noting that the idea has gained traction in recent weeks. 
 The policy would build on a new framework to ease the licensing process for AI chip shipments to data centres in places like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. 
 US Commerce Department officials unveiled those regulations last month and said there are more rules coming. 
 The agency’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls, declined to comment. Nvidia, the market leader for AI chips, also declined to comment, as did Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 
 A representative for Intel Corp, which also makes such processors, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment but pointed to a joint statement by the United States and the UAE on AI. 
 In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards”.
 Setting country-based caps would tighten restrictions that originally targeted China’s ambitions in AI, as Washington considers the security risks of AI development around the world. 
 Already, the Biden administration has restricted AI chip shipments by companies like Nvidia and AMD to more than 40 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia over fears their products could be diverted to China.

 A prevalent issue is the fear among employees that AI will “take over my job”. This anxiety is especially common among senior workers who may be less familiar with emerging technologies. AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot, and Google Bard have intensified these concerns, as many employees are facing a harsh reality check with the increasing automation of tasks. For employers, the appeal of AI lies in its promise of quick results and lower operational costs.
 It is crucial to promote a “humanising AI” culture within organisations. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human labour, employers should encourage the workforce to see AI as a tool that can enhance their daily work, enabling them to deliver more efficient and innovative results. 
 Organisations should invest in upskilling their employees by providing AI-related training that equips them with the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively. For example, courses focusing on AI-enhanced productivity tools, data analytics, or even programming AI systems can prove invaluable.
 This proactive approach not only benefits the company but also empowers employees to develop new competencies that open doors to emerging roles such as “AI Prompters,” “AI Managers,” and “AI Data Analysts”, positions that are yet to be widely recognised but hold significant potential for the future.
 For employees, it is imperative to stay informed about the latest AI developments and continuously upgrade their skills. Those who embrace AI will find that it serves as an enabler rather than a threat. By familiarising themselves with AI tools and integrating these technologies into their daily workflows, employees can gain a competitive advantage in the evolving job market. This approach will not only alleviate fears but also create a more harmonious and productive working environment where AI complements human expertise.
 It is worth noting that AI will not completely replace human roles at least not for some years to come. The technology still requires human intervention for its development, refinement, and ongoing management. 
 In essence, AI is a tool that extends our capabilities, much like an assistant with “super skills” that enhances our productivity and problem-solving abilities.
 By treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a competitor, the workforce can harness its benefits without compromising human value.
 For Malaysia to fully realise its ambitions in the AI space, it is time for employers and employees to step out of their respective comfort zones and become “AI-fide” confident and capable in integrating AI into the workplace. This transformation demands a collective mindset shift towards lifelong learning and adaptability, which will enable us to not just survive, but thrive in this AI-driven era.

740389,Lifestyle,6,14/10/2024,Will AI win a Nobel Prize?,"As AI continues to disrupt various fields, researchers are racing to create ‘AI scientists’ that could one day contribute to Nobel Prize-winning discoveries.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence is already disrupting industries from banking and finance to film and journalism, and scientists are investigating how AI might revolutionise their field – or even win a Nobel Prize.
 In 2021, Japanese scientist Hiroaki Kitano proposed what he dubbed the “Nobel Turing Challenge”, inviting researchers to create an “AI scientist” capable of autonomously carrying out research worthy of a Nobel Prize by 2050.
 Some scientists are already hard at work seeking to create an AI colleague worthy of a Nobel, with this year’s laureates to be announced between Oct 7 and 14.
 And in fact, there are around 100 “robot scientists” already, according to Ross King, a professor of machine intelligence at Chalmers University in Sweden.
 In 2009, King published a paper in which he and a group of colleagues presented “Robot Scientist Adam” – the first machine to make scientific discoveries independently.
 “We built a robot which discovered new science on its own, generated novel scientific ideas and tested them and confirmed that they were correct,” King said.
 The robot was set up to form hypotheses autonomously and then design experiments to test these out.
 It would even program laboratory robots to carry out those experiments before learning from the process and repeating.
 ‘Not trivial’
 “Adam” was tasked with exploring the inner workings of yeast and discovered “functions of genes” that were previously unknown in the organism.
 In the paper, the robot scientist’s creators noted that while the discoveries were “modest”, they were “not trivial” either.
 Later, a second robot scientist – named “Eve” – was set up to study drug candidates for malaria and other tropical diseases.
 According to King, robot scientists already have several advantages over your average human scientist.
 “It costs less money to do the science, they work 24/7,” he explained, adding that they are also more diligent at recording every detail of the process.
 At the same time, King conceded that AI is far from being anywhere close to a Nobel-worthy scientist.
 For that, they would need to be “much more intelligent” and able to “understand the bigger picture”.
 ‘Nowhere near’
 Inga Strumke, an associate professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said that for the time being the scientific profession is safe.
 “The scientific tradition is nowhere near being taken over by machines anytime soon,” she said.
 However, Strumke added that “doesn’t mean that it’s impossible”, adding that it’s “definitely” clear that AI is having and will have an impact on how science is conducted.
 One example of how it is already in use is AlphaFold – an AI model developed by Google DeepMind – which is used to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on their amino acids.
 “We knew that there was some relation between the amino acids and the final three-dimensional shape of the proteins... and then we could use machine learning to find it,” Strumke said.
 She explained that the complexity of such calculations was too daunting for humans.
 “We kind of have a machine that did something that no humans could do,” she said.
 At the same time, for Strumke, the case of AlphaFold also demonstrates one of the weaknesses of current AI models, such as so-called neural networks.
 They are very adept at crunching massive amounts of information and coming up with an answer, but not very good at explaining why that answer is correct.
 So while the over 200 million protein structures predicted by AlphaFold are “extremely useful”, they “don’t teach us anything about microbiology”, Strumke said.
 Aided by AI
 For her, science seeks to understand the universe and is not merely about “making the correct guess”.
 Still, the groundbreaking work done by AlphaFold has led to pundits putting the minds behind it as front-runners for a Nobel Prize.
 Google DeepMind’s director John Jumper and CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis were already honoured with the prestigious Lasker Award in 2023.
 Analytics group Clarivate, which keeps an eye on potential Nobel science laureates, places the pair among the top picks for the 2024 candidates for the Prize in Chemistry, announced on Oct 9.David Pendlebury, head of the research group, admits that while a 2021 paper by Jumper and Hassabis has been cited thousands of times, it would be out of character for the Nobel jury to award work so quickly after publication – as most discoveries that are honoured date back decades.
 At the same time, he feels confident that it won’t be too long before research aided by AI will win the most coveted of science prizes.
 “I’m sure that within the next decade there will be Nobel Prizes that are somehow assisted by computation, and computation these days is more and more AI,” Pendlebury said. – AFP",artificial intelligence industry finance film journalism scientist revolutionise field nobel japanese scientist hiroaki kitano nobel turing challenge researcher scientist capable worthy nobel prize scientist create worthy nobel laureate oct robot scientist professor machine intelligence chalmers university sweden king paper colleague scientist adam machine scientific discovery robot science scientific idea confirmed correct king robot form design experiment program laboratory robot experiment process trivial adam exploring working function gene unknown organism paper robot scientist creator modest trivial robot scientist study drug candidate tropical disease robot scientist average human scientist cost money science diligent detail process time close nobel worthy scientist intelligent understand bigger picture inga strumke associate professor norwegian university science technology time scientific profession safe scientific tradition machine impossible impact science alphafold model google deepmind predict dimensional structure protein amino acid relation amino acid final dimensional shape machine strumke complexity calculation human machine human time strumke alphafold weakness current model neural network massive amount answer answer correct protein structure teach microbiology strumke science seek understand universe correct guess alphafold pundit mind front runner nobel google deepmind director john jumper ceo founder demis hassabis prestigious lasker award analytics eye potential nobel science laureate top pick candidate chemistry oct david pendlebury head paper jumper hassabis thousand time nobel jury award publication discovery decade time feel confident win science prize decade nobel prize computation computation day pendlebury afp,"[(5, 0.9959996)]",5
739827,StarEdu,5,13/10/2024,‘Align TVET with AI’,,"A continuous effort to reform Malaysia’s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is important, says Prof Dr Razali Hassan from the Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Faculty of Technical and Vocational Education.
 The success of Budget 2025 in driving meaningful transformation within the industry depends on the synergistic approach of the Education, Higher Education, and Human Resource Ministries, he said.
 “A substantial allocation towards sustained TVET transformation is necessary to ensure that the goals set by the TVET councils are achieved,” he said, adding that more funds are needed to integrate digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI)-related skills into TVET.
 “This would modernise TVET, align it with future industry demands, and ensure that Malaysia’s workforce continues to be adaptable.
 “Emerging technologies, particularly AI, is important in ensuring that TVET graduates remain competitive,” he said, adding that by incorporating AI-related skills into TVET programmes, students can develop competencies that are highly sought after across industries. 
 “This not only boosts their employability but also equips Malaysia’s workforce to meet the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),” he said.
 In the last budget, RM100mil was allocated to provide professional certification to TVET graduates and as an incentive for the industry to collaborate with public TVET institutions. 
 Budget 2025, he said, should allocate funds to set global standards for the sector. 
 “TVET programmes must be aligned with international standards to facilitate recognition of qualifications across borders, ensuring mobility for learners,” he said, adding that the country’s TVET graduates must be on par with their global counterparts.
 Prof Razali also recommended investing in more TVET programmes that encourage a wider demographic, from low income to high income communities to improve their skills and venture into new fields.
 This, he added, can have far-reaching benefits.
 “By offering TVET skills development to all economic segments, the initiative can promote upward mobility, and bridge the skills gap across different communities. Lower income groups would benefit from access to new job opportunities, while higher income communities can upskill or reskill to remain competitive in evolving industries,” he said.
 He also stressed on the importance of allocating funds to integrate sustainability practices into TVET programmes as this would be a step towards equipping students with the skills needed for emerging green jobs.
 This, he said, is in line with the Unesco-Unevoc vocational education vision on the development and implementation of green strategies to transform the learning and training environment of talents.
 “By embedding sustainability into TVET, students will be better prepared to contribute to eco-friendly industries, which are becoming important globally as economies shift toward more sustainable practices,” he said.
 National Association of Private Educational Institutions (Napei) president Assoc Prof Elajsolan Mohan said Budget 2025 should recognise TVET qualifications in the civil service.“This would inspire confidence in aspiring TVET talents and boost TVET enrolment by providing clearer career prospects in government jobs, particularly for students from underprivileged backgrounds,” he said.",continuous effort reform malaysia technical vocational education training tvet prof razali hassan universiti tun hussein onn malaysia faculty technical vocational education success budget meaningful transformation industry synergistic approach education education human resource ministry substantial allocation tvet transformation goal council fund integrate digital tool artificial intelligence skill modernise tvet align future industry malaysia workforce adaptable technology tvet graduate competitive skill programme student competency sought industry employability equips workforce meet demand fourth industrial revolution budget mil provide professional certification tvet incentive industry public tvet institution budget allocate fund global standard sector tvet programme international standard facilitate recognition qualification border mobility learner country tvet par global counterpart prof razali tvet programme wider demographic low income income community skill venture field benefit tvet skill development economic segment initiative upward mobility bridge skill gap community income benefit access job opportunity income community competitive industry fund integrate sustainability practice programme student skill green job unesco unevoc vocational education vision development implementation green strategy training environment talent sustainability tvet student contribute eco friendly industry economy sustainable practice national association private educational institution president assoc prof elajsolan budget recognise tvet qualification civil service inspire confidence tvet talent tvet enrolment clearer career prospect government job student background,"[(3, 0.9954463)]",3
739641,Main,14,12/10/2024,‘AI vital for economic growth’,Gobind: Enhancing talent pool imperative for nation’s development,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia must do more to build its talent pool in artificial intelligence (AI), says Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo.
 “There is a lot of positive sentiment at the moment and Malaysia’s digital economy is expected to contribute 25.5%, if not more, to the country’s GDP (gross domestic product) by the end of 2025.
 “All this bodes well for our country, but we cannot be complacent. We need to continue raising the bar in transforming Malaysia into a regional AI hub, and this includes establishing a skilled workforce to satisfy the growing demands of the tech industry,” he said at the opening of Malaysia’s first fully AI-based academy set up by Gamuda Bhd with the support of Google Cloud yesterday.
 He praised the collaboration between two giants, one in construction and the other in computing, for helping to fill the gap in Malaysia’s AI talent pool.
 Noting the extensive use of technology when Gamuda built the country’s first two MRT lines, now known as the Kajang and Putrajaya lines in Klang Valley, Gobind said he is excited that extensive digitalisation has been making waves in the construction industry – from autonomous tunnel-­boring machines to the use of digital twins in creating interactive virtual representations of physical buildings.
 “This is, however, only the tip of the iceberg. Modernising the workforce and keeping up with the latest developments is absolutely crucial to avoid falling behind,” he said.
 “Equipping our youths with the right skills, especially in this digital era, is also something our Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is very concerned about, as he has repeatedly called for more AI-related lessons and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) training in school and other learning institutions,” he said.
 On the academy, Gobind expressed hope that more of such partnerships will materialise in the near future.
 “Such public-private partnerships are pivotal to strengthening the digital ecosystem in Malaysia,” he said.
 In his speech, John Lim Ji Xiong, Gamuda’s group chief digital officer, said the academy’s mission is to equip individuals with hands-on AI development skills inspired by Gamuda’s track record of technical training and digital capabilities.
 “Through our long-standing partnership with Google Cloud, both companies have a common vision to grow the local talent pool to fully utilise the upcoming Google Malaysia data centres as announced by the Prime Minister on Oct 1,” he said.
 Serene Sia, Google Cloud’s country director for Malaysia and Singapore, said Google Cloud believes in making AI skills and tools more accessible to create a better future for Malaysia.
 “We can unlock growth opportunities and solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges. Gamuda has always been a pioneer in embracing technology to build MRT lines, tunnels, bridges, and expressways that benefit many Malaysians quickly while ensu­ring safety,” she said in her speech.
 “This academy represents their continued efforts to make a positive impact in Malaysia,  for Malaysians.” 
 Lim said in an interview that the extensive partnership with Google unlocks the full potential of cloud computing.
 “This synergy empowers Gamuda to pioneer innovative solutions across our projects, leveraging our deep industry expertise and Google’s cutting-edge technology. Together, we achieve more than the sum of our parts,” he said.
 The Gamuda AI Academy is inviting those aged from 21 to 40 to join its three-month-long boot camp that will equip students with the skills to take advantage of the future when many things are data-driven.
 It offers students a full-stack development course, giving them the chance to gain the knowledge necessary to create an AI application from beginning to end.
 The first intake in September attracted 42 students, ranging from fresh graduates in IT and engineering to mid-career professionals seeking to upskill, with the aim of eventually training around 1,500 students over the next five years.
 As of now, Gamuda has committed an initial seed funding of RM2.5mil to train 350 candidates for the next two years.",jaya malaysia talent pool artificial intelligence digital minister gobind singh deo lot positive sentiment moment malaysia digital economy contribute country gross domestic product bodes country complacent bar malaysia regional hub workforce satisfy demand tech industry malaysia academy gamuda bhd support google cloud yesterday collaboration giant construction gap malaysia talent pool extensive technology gamuda country mrt line putrajaya line valley gobind extensive digitalisation construction industry autonomous tunnel machine digital twin interactive virtual representation physical building workforce development crucial avoid youth skill digital era prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim lesson technical vocational education training tvet school learning institution gobind hope partnership future public private partnership pivotal digital ecosystem malaysia speech john lim xiong gamuda chief digital officer academy mission equip individual development skill gamuda track record technical training digital capability partnership google cloud company common vision local talent pool utilise google malaysia data centre prime minister oct serene sia google cloud country director google cloud skill tool accessible create future malaysia unlock growth opportunity humanity biggest challenge pioneer technology build mrt line tunnel bridge benefit malaysian safety speech academy continued effort positive impact malaysia malaysian interview extensive partnership google potential cloud synergy empowers innovative solution project deep industry expertise google edge technology sum gamuda join month boot camp equip student skill advantage future data driven student stack development chance gain knowledge create application intake september student fresh graduate engineering mid career professional upskill aim student initial seed funding mil train candidate,"[(2, 0.32000965), (5, 0.67675865)]",5
737821,StarBiz,12,10/10/2024,OpenAI to focus on improving regional tie-ups,New office in island state to become second in Asia,"SINGAPORE: ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company synonymous with bringing generative artificial intelligence (AI) into the spotlight, will open its second office in Asia in Singapore later in 2024.
 The Singapore office – the company’s fourth international branch – will focus on advancing regional collaboration, including work with national AI programme AI Singapore on generative AI models that are tuned to understand and reflect cultures and languages in South-East Asia.
 OpenAI’s expansion here signals the start-up’s long-term plans to tap Singapore’s growing pool of tech talent and deepen its roots in the region, acting as a hub for its Asia-Pacific (Apac) partners.
 Chief executive officer Sam Altman said in a statement yesterday: “Singapore, with its rich history of technology leadership, has emerged as a leader in AI, recognising its potential to solve some of society’s hardest problems and advance economic growth.
 “We’re excited to partner with the government and the country’s thriving AI ecosystem as we expand into the Apac region.”
 Altman, 39, last visited Singapore in June 2023 during a world tour to discuss AI-related issues and address concerns about the rapid roll-out of its signature product, ChatGPT, which brought generative AI into the mainstream.
 OpenAI, founded in 2015, has offices in London, Dublin and Tokyo. The location of its Singapore office is still being finalised.
 It will focus on supporting customers and partnerships with governments, businesses and institutions, said OpenAI.
 “These plans reflect Singapore’s leadership position in technology and AI, as well as the growing demand for advanced AI tools across Apac,” said OpenAI, which added that Singaporeans are among the highest-per-capita users of ChatGPT worldwide, with the number of weekly active users here doubling since the start of 2024.
 When asked, OpenAI confirmed that it plans to hire between five and 10 employees before 2025, for roles related to sales, security and solutions engineering, among others, and is committed to hiring local talent.
 Its regional operations will be led by Oliver Jay, who will serve as managing director of international operations and will be based here. Jay was previously chief revenue officer at software company Asana and an independent board director at Grab.
 The firm will work more closely with Singapore government partners, such as the Economic Development Board (EDB), to support AI development here.
 OpenAI added: “Establishing a regional presence brings OpenAI closer to innovative local companies, such as Grab in Singapore and Canva in Australia, which are using OpenAI’s advanced AI products to power new tools and features for their customers.”
 With that, OpenAI aims to make advanced AI more accessible in South-east Asia and will provide up to US$1mil to develop resources to ensure AI models that reflect the region’s diverse languages and cultures under a new partnership with AI Singapore.
 As an agency tasked with driving the growth of the technology here, AI Singapore is developing Sea-Lion, a network of ChatGPT-like large language models that are specifically trained for South-East Asian users to ensure that there is an AI that captures the region’s cultures.
 Since OpenAI made ChatGPT public in 2022, its presence in Singapore has expanded quickly, with its technology being integrated into AI solutions used by both businesses and the government, including customer service chatbots and an internal AI assistant for civil servants, Pair.
 AI models by Google Cloud and Meta have also entered the fray and are among the systems that are being tested by the authorities here in various projects.
 EDB managing director Jacqueline Poh said OpenAI’s entry is a sign of the strength of the city-state’s growing AI ecosystem, investments in AI talent, computation and demand from businesses.
 OpenAI’s operations here are likely to help spark new collaborations across the sector, she added. — The Straits Times/ANN",singapore chatgpt maker san francisco company synonymous generative artificial intelligence spotlight office asia singapore office company fourth international branch focus regional collaboration national programme generative model reflect culture south east asia openai expansion signal term plan pool tech talent deepen root region hub asia pacific partner chief executive officer altman statement yesterday rich history technology leadership leader potential solve society hardest advance economic growth partner government country ecosystem apac region altman singapore june tour issue address concern rapid roll signature product chatgpt generative mainstream openai office london dublin tokyo location singapore office focus customer partnership government business institution plan leadership position technology demand tool openai singaporean user worldwide active user start openai plan employee role sale security solution engineering local talent regional operation jay director international operation jay chief revenue officer software company independent board director firm singapore government partner economic development board support development regional presence brings innovative local company canva australia product power tool customer aim accessible south east asia mil resource model region diverse culture partnership singapore agency growth technology sea lion network chatgpt language model south east asian user capture region culture chatgpt public presence singapore technology solution business government customer service chatbots internal assistant civil servant pair model cloud meta fray system authority project director jacqueline poh openai entry sign strength city ecosystem investment talent computation demand business operation collaboration sector time,"[(2, 0.67795575), (3, 0.31878337)]",2

737069,Main,11,08/10/2024,TRANSFORMING HOME CUSTOMISATION WITH AI,,"HOMEBUYING has long been a tedious process, filled with rigid options, endless paperwork and a distinct lack of personalisation that often leaves buyers settling for homes that only partially meet their needs or preferences.
 From standardised floor plans to limited design choices, the traditional approach offers little to no flexibility for those seeking to create a space that truly reflects their lifestyle and vision.
 But, with advancements in technology like artificial intelligence (AI) – particularly Generative AI – the homebuying experience is poised for digital transformation.
 Gamuda Bhd’s property arm, Gamuda Land, is paving the way for this innovative experience as the company provides prospective homeowners with enhanced internal customisation options for its latest Park Homes development, The Clove, via the soon-to-be-launched GL Connect Portal.
 The Clove is a cluster of eight homes, consisting of four corner units and four intermediate units arranged around a gated communal garden, shared exclusively among the eight homes.
 Each unit will feature a private garden and offer spacious built-up areas ranging from 1,950 sq ft to 2,210 sq ft, with an indicative starting price from RM750,000.
 A new era of digital  customisation
 Gamuda’s groundbreaking customisation portal harnesses the power of Gen AI to offer homebuyers flexible options for personalisation, allowing them to design their dream homes with ease, reshaping the entire journey from selection to moving-in.
 The initiative is part of Gamuda’s “Trifecta of Innovations”, which encompasses digital innovation, design innovation and its in-house next-gen digital industrialised building system (IBS).
 This integrated approach is a hallmark of Gamuda Group, made possible through the collaboration of its property development, construction and digitalisation arms. 
 All design and digital innovations are conceptualised and developed in-house by dedicated specialised teams, ensuring a seamless integration of cutting-edge technology and design excellence.
 Gamuda Bhd group chief digital officer John Lim Ji Xiong explains that the company aims to reinvent the customer experience by allowing them to tailor The Clove to their preferences.
 “It’s all about driving the whole customisation experience for customers. 
 “With the GL Connect Portal, customers can make decisions on what they want their homes to look like from the very start of the homebuying journey – with the click of a button – by simply interacting with the AI,” says Lim.
 Lim shares that the portal was developed in-house using Google’s Gemini Pro multimodal language model, as part of Gamuda’s strategic partnership with Google Cloud.
 This enables the AI on the portal to converse in three languages (English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese), with speech-to-text functionality.
 “Sometimes, customers need more time to decide on what type of design or layout they want, instead of feeling pressured to make quick decisions at a sales gallery.
 “By using this portal, every homeowner has the freedom to choose what they want, at their own pace,” he adds.
 Lim says that with the power of AI, the company can break past the limitations of traditional home buying, as the AI can chat with customers, discuss and even recommend their ideal home based on their requests. There will be no additional charges for homes customisations. 
 Lim adds that the digital environment of the portal also aids in reducing errors when it comes to the construction phase of development, as all design information is recorded and shared with contractors via a cloud-based system.
 Reimagining home: Sustainable living for the futureBeyond these innovative features, The Clove exemplifies Gamuda Land’s commitment to sustainable living. 
 These homes come equipped with solar panel readiness, featuring reinforced roofs with built-in isolators as well as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. 
 This integration of modern sustainable design principles is just the beginning of what Gamuda Land envisions for the future of living spaces.
 Gamuda Land chief operating officer Jess Teng Poh Fern, emphasises the company’s dedication to environmental responsibility, stating: “We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint, and our next-gen digital IBS technology plays a crucial role in this. 
 “By minimising construction waste and enhancing efficiency, we ensure quicker delivery times without sacrificing quality.” 
 This focus on innovation not only meets today’s needs but also future-proofs the homes for generations to come. 
 Understanding the diverse needs of busy professionals and young families, Gamuda Land aims to create vibrant, sustainable communities. 
 “We strive to simplify the transition to sustainable living for our residents. That’s why we offer options for customers to enhance their homes with green and smart features, such as EV charging stations, solar panels and Samsung Smart Home devices, all accessible through our GL Connect portal,” Teng explains. 
 She noted that the portal also offers an interior design option, further enhancing convenience for homebuyers.
 “This empowers families to embrace a sustainable lifestyle from day one. 
 “Once customers have made their selections, they’ll be guided to a summary page that outlines their chosen customisations and packages. 
 “After confirming their order, they simply need to schedule an appointment with one of our relationship associates at our Experience Galleries to finalise their booking,” she adds.
 The home customisation portal will be publicly accessible on Gamuda Land’s website on Oct 15, allowing anyone to explore the innovative features of Gen AI.
 The Clove is set to debut in three of Gamuda Land’s thriving satellite townships in the Klang Valley: Gamuda Cove (Kuala Langat), Gamuda Gardens (Sungai Buloh North) and The Clove Signature series at twentyfive7 (South of Kota Kemuning). 
 The Clove Signature series will feature premium fittings and is located within a well-established township, providing residents with convenient access to amenities at the popular Quayside Mall.

736643,Lifestyle,5,07/10/2024,Weathering       the storm with            AI,Extreme weather is taxing utilities in the United States more often. How can artificial intelligence help?,"More than four million people were without power on a Friday morning on Sept 27 after the enormous ring of wind and rain known as Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida, United States, and moved north.
 It is the latest storm to show utility companies’ increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events that are becoming more common and more intense under climate change.
 “There are a lot of different signs of climate-related weather risks to infrastructure,” said Catie Hausman, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. Those risks include hurricanes and flooding, wildfires, heat waves and increased tornado risks or cold snaps in regions less used to them.
 Extreme weather has increasingly strained the grid, and it is the No 1 cause of major power outages in the United States. In some areas of the country, the risk of hurricane-induced power outages could become 50% higher in the coming decades as such storms get stronger.
 Wind and rain are the dominant factors that can strain power grids, said Andrea Staid, a researcher in energy systems and climate analysis at the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.
 The institute’s models show that as more hurricanes affect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, more power outages will occur if the grid does not change.
 “Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem,” Staid said. “Our models show that these storms can travel pretty far inland with strong winds, so we need to make sure people and communities have the information and resources needed to prepare.”
 Now, in an effort to better predict what storms are coming and how to transition out of a fossil-dependent grid, utilities are looking to a new generation of technologies driven by artificial intelligence (AI).
 Hausman said that while she did not know whether AI was the right way to harden the grid, modern data and computing were needed to understand the problems.
 “Whether AI is giving us something new or a black box of mush is going to depend on the company and the tools they’re using,” Hausman said.
 What is clear? Utilities need to spend a lot of money to update their power systems to deal with storms both present and future.
 “We’re still thinking of the grid as we have for the past 100 years, and it’s increasingly obvious that needs to change,” said Mark Dyson, managing director of the carbon-free electricity programme at the global research firm Rocky Mountain Institute.
 “Extreme weather, ageing infrastructure and new technology are coming together in a way that creates an opportunity to use better technology, including AI-driven software, to help us keep the lights on and keep the grid affordable,” Dyson said.
 One of the newest players in the nascent industry is Rhizome, a company founded in 2022 that uses AI-driven technology to help electric utilities identify and plan for vulnerabilities that could cause power failures.
 “Rhizome’s AI platform approach is to fundamentally understand the relationships between hurricane conditions and grid impacts,” said Mishal Thadani, Rhizome’s co-founder. 
 The company’s data points from thousands of hurricane-related asset failures and what caused them can show utilities their long-term risks from hurricanes, helping them figure out where to harden poles, move power lines underground or cut vegetation.
 “Ultimately, we’re able to project how many future potential hurricane-related outages will be reduced per dollar of utility investment,” Thadani said.
 Figuring out how to harden the grid and expand the country’s transmission network could lower costs to consumers, bring more renewables online and reduce power outages, Hausman said.
 Most utilities are already using some   machine learning or AI technology, said Booga Gilbertson, a former utility executive and an investor in Rhizome. Right now, the flashy types of AI programming are language models like ChatGPT from Microsoft or Gemini from Google. Machine learning has been combing through a mind-boggling amount of data for more than a decade, Gilbertson said.
 “It seems like once a month there’s a new entrant into this space,” she said. “Products like this are relatively new to the market, and the advent of AI and computing power have made them more available. It’s a tool utilities can now put into their tool chest.”
 AI is also a known energy hog, and could ramp up the nation’s electricity demand by as much as 20% by the end of the decade. But the US, like other global powers, wants to lead the world in AI. In September, the White House convened a group of utilities, AI companies and data centre operators to strategise for the future.
 As the country’s transmission system struggles beneath the weight of growing electrification and a changing generation mix, the growing set of AI-driven products could potentially pivot AI’s bad climate reputation.
 “I suspect that the amount of energy we would spend more than pays for itself in terms of maintaining an affordable and reliable grid,” Dyson said. “But the data to support that suspicion doesn’t exist yet. The industry is so immature we don’t have an outlook yet for the types of sectors that would be most advantaged from AI.”
 As new companies enter the space, AI climate modelling is still a bit of a Wild West.
 Andre Coleman, chief scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, leads a team that developed a program called RADR-Fire to build risk prediction models for wildfires. He said such models are also available for other hazardous events like tropical cyclones, extreme rain and extreme heat, extending as far into the future as 2100.
 “Particularly when we’re talking about assessing risk around disaster events, we have to be really, really sure about what those machine-learning models are doing, especially for unique or outlier events,” Coleman said.
 Coleman wants cooperation to make sure the methods and models are the same, then make all that data accessible, especially for smaller utilities with fewer resources, like rural cooperatives.
 “You end up with this huge mosaic of people who are doing this kind of risk modelling using all kinds of different data sets; some are appropriate, others aren’t,” he said. “Those are the things that concern me a lot.” – The New York Times",people power friday morning sept enormous ring wind rain hurricane helene landfall florida north storm utility company vulnerability extreme weather event common intense climate change lot sign weather risk infrastructure hausman public policy university michigan risk hurricane wildfire heat wave tornado risk cold snap region grid major power outage united country risk hurricane power outage decade storm stronger wind rain dominant factor power grid andrea researcher energy system analysis nonprofit electric power institute institute model hurricane gulf atlantic coast power outage grid change hurricane coastal staid model storm strong wind people community resource effort predict storm transition fossil dependent grid utility generation technology artificial intelligence hausman harden grid modern data understand black box mush company hausman utility lot money update power system deal future grid obvious change mark dyson director carbon free electricity programme global firm institute extreme weather infrastructure technology creates opportunity technology software light affordable dyson player nascent industry company driven technology electric utility plan vulnerability power rhizome platform approach understand relationship hurricane condition impact mishal thadani rhizome founder company thousand hurricane asset failure utility term risk hurricane figure harden pole power line cut vegetation project future potential hurricane outage dollar utility investment thadani harden grid expand country transmission network cost consumer renewables power outage hausman utility machine technology booga gilbertson utility executive investor rhizome flashy type language model microsoft gemini google machine mind boggling amount data decade gilbertson month entrant space product market advent power tool utility chest energy hog ramp nation electricity demand decade global power september white house utility company data centre operator future country transmission system weight electrification generation set product pivot bad climate reputation suspect amount energy pay term affordable reliable grid dyson data support suspicion industry immature outlook sector company space climate bit wild west andre coleman chief scientist pacific northwest national laboratory team program radr fire build risk prediction model model hazardous event tropical cyclone extreme extreme heat future risk disaster event machine model unique outlier event coleman coleman cooperation method model data accessible utility fewer resource rural cooperative huge mosaic people kind data set concern lot york time,"[(6, 0.9974304)]",6
736287,StarBiz 7,16,05/10/2024,Pragmatic AI and cloud computing policy needed,,"THE government’s national cloud computing policy plan is necessary to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) even though it means adding yet another layer of regulations.
 Chaos will ensue if AI is not regulated. As for cloud computing, there are issues of mandating the localisation of storage and its data protection.
 In all of this, the focus should be on enhancing governance and ensuring fair and proper execution of the rules.
 One fear, especially going by experiences in Malaysia, is that business activity is unfairly stymied by new levels of approval that not only cause delays in running businesses but also result in additional costs. 
 Another concern is government IT procurement. Suppose the new rules require the government to use more AI and cloud computing, then it must procure this technology at the lowest possible price and not through “crony” companies.
 After all, one of the many promises of the unity government is to stop unnecessary spending on external consultants and other areas. 
 There have been far too many instances of outsourcing tasks to the private sector through so-called public-private partnerships. Most of the time, private sector parties have had the advantage of less risk and more benefits.
 That said, governments do face the challenge of developing in-house AI capabilities due to a lack of talent and resources. So sometimes it needs to engage external parties to help and it can be cost-effective. 
 If the government chooses that route, it would do itself good by explaining why a particular company was chosen, its track record and how cost-effective the service is going to be.
 AI regulations ought to also provide guidelines on how the government machinery should use AI to enhance the delivery of public services. It should not result in more complexities and additional costs for users. The privacy of users also needs to be protected.
 Then there is the issue of AI for the private sector. Most companies do not know what they should do with cloud services and AI. The fear is that AI could disrupt their businesses. 
 Hence, a well-designed AI regulatory framework should pave the way for private companies to adopt AI in a responsible way. There needs to be a balance between oversight and innovation.
 For regulation of cloud services, new rules need to focus on sustainable practices within the data centre industry, which is booming at a significant rate in Malaysia and considering the vast amounts of energy they consume. 
 The regulatory framework should enforce strict licensing on data centres which must adhere to sustainable energy usage, proof of local content and employment and also local data protection and cybersecurity rules.
 Assoc Prof Dr Selvakumar Manickam of Universiti Sains Malaysia gives his wishlist for what should be in the cloud and AI regulations. In summary: 
 l It must ensure data sovereignty by mandating local data storage, as seen in the case of TikTok in the United States, where concerns about the app’s data practices raised significant national security issues. 
 l Cloud service providers must ensure compliance to Malaysian cyber laws, such as the Malaysian Cybersecurity Act (Act 854) in addition to global cybersecurity standards. 
 l The new AI and cloud policies should also ensure that local talent development is mandatory, equipping Malaysians with the necessary cloud-related skills to support the country’s digital transformation. 
 l Mandating sustainable and green practices by cloud data centres.
 l Mandating risk assessments to prevent AI-related hazards, especially in critical sectors like healthcare and energy, while also ensuring human oversight and accountability in AI decisions. 
 l AI should be used as a decision-support tool and not as a decision-making tool. Since AI relies heavily on vast amounts of data, regulations must include strict measures for how this data is gathered, stored and used. This is especially important to safeguard personal information and ensure responsible AI development. 
 l This includes complying with national and international data protection laws. Regular audits and an oversight body are also essential to ensure compliance and responsible AI development. Many of the regulations and policies for both cloud and AI are intertwined as the data storage and AI engine are provided by the cloud, in many cases.
 l Since cloud technology is often the backbone for AI systems, particularly for data storage and processing, regulations will need to address both areas in a coordinated way. This will ensure responsible and ethical AI development within a secure cloud environment.",government national cloud policy plan artificial intelligence layer regulation ensue cloud issue localisation storage data protection focus governance fair proper execution rule experience malaysia business activity level approval business additional cost concern government procurement suppose rule government cloud procure technology lowest price crony company unity government unnecessary spending external consultant instance task private sector public private partnership time private sector party risk benefit government house capability talent resource external party effective government chooses company track record cost effective service regulation guideline government machinery delivery public service result complexity additional cost user user issue private sector company service fear disrupt business regulatory framework private company responsible balance oversight innovation regulation cloud service rule sustainable practice data centre industry rate malaysia vast amount energy regulatory framework enforce strict licensing data centre sustainable energy usage proof local content employment local data protection cybersecurity rule prof selvakumar manickam universiti sains malaysia wishlist cloud regulation summary data local data storage tiktok united concern data practice national security issue service provider compliance malaysian cyber law malaysian cybersecurity addition global cybersecurity standard cloud policy local talent development mandatory malaysian skill support country digital transformation sustainable green practice data centre risk assessment hazard critical sector energy human oversight accountability decision decision support tool decision tool relies vast amount data regulation strict measure data stored safeguard personal responsible development national international data protection law regular audit essential compliance responsible development regulation policy data storage engine cloud cloud technology backbone system data storage processing regulation responsible ethical development secure cloud environment,"[(2, 0.72764987), (6, 0.2694785)]",2
736295,StarBiz 7,28,05/10/2024,Will AI boost growth in Asia?,,"THERE is much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sparking off a revival of growth globally. How far is that true?
 In recent years, growth everywhere has slowed down due to productivity declines, in spite of the Internet and computer revolution. 
 As Nobel Laureate economist Robert Solow said in 1987: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in productivity statistics”. 
 From 1996 to 2005, US labour productivity growth averaged 2.62%, but slowed to 1% from 2006 to 2017. This trend cuts across different countries and has different reasons, such as financial crises, capital deepening, trade and mismeasurement factors.
 When AI arrived with a ChatGPT bang, everyone thought this was the biggest productivity innovation since the internet - we could write research theses to poems in seconds. 
 In a recent essay on the macroeconomics of AI, Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Gabriel Unger argued that AI could developed in three different forks (good or bad), namely through productivity growth, income inequality and industrial concentration. 
 Without a proper set of policies and regulations, we may end up with the worst of three worlds – low productivity, worse income inequality and huge power concentration.   On the other hand, with the right set of policies, an emerging and developing market economy could end up with higher productivity, more inclusivity and less market concentration.  
 It takes a lot of market size and talent to achieve leadership in AI and technology.   The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) recently published a paper tracking 64 core technologies using cited research papers, which showed that the leading position of United States and China have reversed in the last five years (2019-2023), with India in third place, although Europe as a group is third, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. India is strong because she has one of the largest cohort of STEM graduates coming into her workforce.  
 Although the ASPI study is basically a desktop study of cited and published academic papers, the mainstream view is that China is undisputedly in the lead in the core manufacturing area, but the United States and her Western allies remain better in the cutting edge technology areas. 
 However, China’s ability to catch up on the latest five nanometer semiconductor chips may be as short as three years behind TSMC technology.  Clearly, attempts to constrain China through technology sanctions and restrictions to access from cutting edge technology only spur her to invest even more heavily in developing domestic technology. 
 For the Great Powers, cost seems to be less of a concern where national security is concerned.  
 It is estimated that the cost of building a top-of-the-line semiconductor fabrication plant has soared from US$400mil for a 65 nm chip in 2006 to US$5.4bil by 2020. McKinsey has shown that the top 10 in the semiconductor field account for the bulk of revenue and investments, demonstrating that technology (including AI) is highly concentrated and indeed generates income inequality.
 Most would agree that governments should do as much as possible to narrow the digital divide by introducing mass digital and re-skilling education.  Indeed, one of the fields where AI can excel is to help students learn much faster, using an AI bot as a teaching assistant.    
 The first set of persons to be trained in using and applying AI should be civil servants, because government processes lie at the heart of almost all business and social transactions. 
 The private sector can innovate all it wants but its productivity will stop at the first bureaucratic red tape. Hence, system productivity cannot be increased without first increasing government productivity. 
 Professor Brynjolfsson has argued that getting to the “better forks” is good policy, and would include creative policy experiments, a set of positive goals for what society wants from AI, and understanding that technology brings uncertainties in outcomes, so flexibility in implementation is critical.
 Herein lies the common pattern to why productivity cannot progress in more complex societies. 
 As businesses grow more sophisticated, laws and regulations rise in number and complexity, with often patchy enforcement, so that only the large or rich can afford the lawyers to manoeuvre around the bureaucratic swamp.  
 Corruption is encouraged where laws proliferate with little transparency as to enforcement or outcomes.  
 In less sophisticated communities which live close to each other, everyone shares and cooperates to build social well-being, such as digging wells, maintaining the commons, and solving problems through consensus. 
 Using Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps’ expression, mass flourishing requires mass grassroots cooperation. You cannot delegate this just to civil servants. 
 Just as teaching children digital skills require teaching the teachers first, we must teach the civil servants first by working with them to solve mutual problems. This is not about getting consultants to teach the civil servants, but getting the private sector to work with the civil servants in real live cases on how to improve state-market processes, such as licensing, compliance issues and actual policy outcomes and objectives.
 All too often, in a world of delegation to experts or specialists, policies, rules and regulations have been passed with their original intention or objectives forgotten. 
 The result is many laws exist that few understand, and are often obsolete. AI could identify cases of artificial stupidity (often unintended) that actually create waste and frustration. 
 I often wonder whether traffic lights that are mechanically operated can be easily replaced by smart CCTV cameras that can calibrate traffic and avoid huge waste of fuel and time in massive traffic jams.  
 We need to work together to solve our mutual problems.  Working together using AI may be a good start.",hype artificial intelligence technology revival growth true growth productivity decline computer revolution nobel laureate economist robert computer age productivity statistic productivity growth trend cut country reason financial crisis capital trade mismeasurement factor chatgpt bang biggest productivity innovation internet write thesis macroeconomics stanford economist brynjolfsson gabriel unger fork bad productivity growth income inequality industrial concentration proper policy regulation world low productivity worse income inequality huge power concentration hand policy market economy productivity inclusivity market concentration lot market size talent leadership technology australian strategic policy institute aspi paper core technology paper position united china india europe kingdom japan korea india strong largest cohort stem workforce aspi study study academic paper mainstream view lead core manufacturing united western ally edge technology china ability semiconductor chip short tsmc technology attempt china technology sanction restriction access edge technology invest domestic technology power concern national security cost building top semiconductor fabrication plant mil chip bil mckinsey top semiconductor field account bulk revenue investment technology concentrated generates income inequality agree government narrow digital divide mass digital education field excel student faster assistant person civil servant government lie heart business social transaction private sector productivity bureaucratic red tape system productivity government productivity professor brynjolfsson fork policy creative policy experiment positive goal society technology brings uncertainty flexibility implementation critical common pattern productivity progress complex society business sophisticated law regulation complexity patchy enforcement rich afford lawyer bureaucratic swamp corruption law proliferate transparency enforcement sophisticated community close share social digging common consensus nobel laureate edmund expression mass mass grassroots cooperation civil servant child digital skill teacher civil servant mutual consultant civil servant private sector civil servant real live improve market compliance issue actual policy delegation expert specialist policy rule regulation original intention objective result law understand obsolete artificial stupidity unintended create waste frustration traffic light smart cctv camera traffic avoid huge waste fuel time massive traffic jam mutual start,"[(5, 0.77996033), (6, 0.21758911)]",5

 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Cerebras disclosed that its sales increased to US$136.4mil in the first six months of the year, up from US$8.7mil in the period a year earlier. 
 Cerebras had previously filed confidentially for the IPO in August. 
 The Sunnyvale, California-based firm recorded a net loss of US$66.6mil in the six-month period, compared with a net loss of US$77.8mil a year earlier, the filing showed. 
 It also revealed that it depends on Abu Dhabi’s Group 42 Holding Ltd (G42), an AI company, for most of its revenue.
 The filing depicts a company still in the early stages of taking on Nvidia and other established chipmakers, but it looks to gain an edge with a different approach. 
 CS-3, Cerebras’ flagship system, is optimised to handle AI computing workloads and can be clustered together to power AI supercomputers.
 Founder and chief executive officer Andrew Feldman said his firm’s chips, and the computing systems equipped with them, will upend the AI computing industry. 
 So far, the 10s of billions of dollars poured into running AI models and generating responses have mostly flowed to Nvidia’s graphics processing units.
 Cerebras and the selling shareholders won’t disclose proposed terms for the share sale, including the company’s valuation in a listing, until a later filing.

734544,Main,7,01/10/2024,AI already transforming jobs today,"Its advent is poised to have varying impacts in different sectors, says Sim","KUALA LUMPUR: Approxi­mate­ly 16% of the 97 job roles in the financial sector are expected to be significantly transformed by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), says Human Resources Minis­ter Steven Sim.
 “We are looking at roles such as customer service officers, investment advisory and execution analysts, direct sales agents, product sales officers, relationship managers, business development man­a­gers, credit and lending offi­cers, investment operations as well as security service officers.
 “Three quarters (75%) of roles will experience medium to low impact, while about 9% will be emerging roles, which are not commonly seen in the sector currently but will gain prominence soon.
 “These emerging roles include machine learning specialists, integration architects, cloud engineers, digital transformation and adoption analysts, community part­nership advisers, and sustai­nability and employee well-being officers,” he said during his speech at the launch of the National Human Capital Conference and Exhibition (NHCCE) 2024 held by the Human Resource Develop­ment Corporation (HRD Corp) here yesterday.
 According to Sim, in the ICT sector, 8% of current roles will be highly impacted, including security operation analysts, data analysts, application support engineers, data centre infrastructure engineers, network engineers, IT auditors and cyber risk analysts.
 “Emerging skills in this sector include emerging technology synthesis, automation management, test planning, IT strategy and solu­tion architecture,” he added.
 Sim also highlighted the use of AI technology in providing recom­mendations for grant applications and claims submitted by emplo­yers or training providers based on preset logic and criteria.
 “AI will analyse the provided information and documents, and suggest whether the application should be approved or rejected, or if additional information is required,” he explained.
 Sim shared an example of the benefit of using AI, stating that it had helped reduce the grant appli­cation processing time at HRD Corp from 154 hours in 2022 (with 239,776 applications processed) to 19 hours in 2023 (with 359,170 applications processed).
 “Another example is in the Social Security Organisation (Socso), where we issue guarantee letters (GLs) to our contributors, provided for free for those needing implants for rehabilitation.
 “Normally, it takes three days to issue a GL. Today, we are using AI to speed up the process of verifying the eligibility of contributors within one hour,” he added.
 NHCCE 2024, held from Sept 30 to Oct 2, is the flagship annual conference organised by the HRD Corp, an agency under the Human Resources Ministry dedicated to national human capi­tal development through upskilling and reskilling.
 This year’s theme is Humanising AI for the Future Workforce, focusing on how HR practitioners can leverage AI for future workforce strategies.The conference will feature over 4,000 global delegates and more than 30 speakers, including international figures like Mehdi Hasan, Shawn Kanungo and John Mattone, as well as local figures such as Venon Tian, co-founder and COO of Zus Coffee, and Pei Si Lai, CEO of GXBank.
 NHCCE 2024 will include panel discussions, interactive sessions and networking opportunities to foster global exchange.
 Additionally, it will host one of the largest exhibition areas in the region, with over 300 exhibitors showcasing the latest in upskilling, wellness platforms and technology.
 Sim also attended an appreciation ceremony for Malaysian cham­pions at the recent World­Skills Competition (WSC) Lyon 2024, where Malaysia’s contingent featured 15 participants who returned home with a bronze medal in beauty therapy, and four medals for excellence in electrical installations, bricklaying, IT software solutions for business and hairdressing.
 Wong Hsun Wei, a student from Sense Perfect International College, won the bronze medal in beauty therapy and was also named “Best of Nation”.
 Sim presented the medals, mock cheques and certificates to the winners and encouraged all parties to strive for excellence.
 The competition featured 1,400 skilled youths from 69 countries competing in 62 skill areas.

734040,StarBiz,10,30/09/2024,"If AI seems smarter​, it’s thanks to smarter humans","Companies hiring physicians, analysts and accountants","STOCKHOLM: In the early years, getting artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.
 But more sophisticated updates to AI models in the fiercely competitive arena are now demanding a rapidly expanding network of human trainers who have specialised knowledge – from historians to scientists, some with doctorate degrees. 
 “A year ago, we could get away with hiring undergraduates, to just generally teach AI on how to improve,” said Cohere co-founder Ivan Zhang, talking about its internal human trainers.
 “Now we have licensed physicians teaching the models how to behave in medical environments, or financial analysts or accountants,” Zhang said. 
 For more training, Cohere, which was last valued at over US$5bil, works with a startup called Invisible Tech. 
 Cohere is one of the main rivals of OpenAI and specialises in AI for businesses. The startup Invisible Tech employs thousands of trainers, working remotely, and has become one of the main partners of AI companies ranging from AI21 to Microsoft to train their AI models to reduce errors, known in the AI world as hallucinations.
 “We have 5,000 people in over 100 countries around the world that are PhDs, Master’s degree holders and knowledge-work specialists,” said Invisible founder Francis Pedraza.
 Invisible pays as much as US$40 per hour, depending on the location of the worker and the complexity of work. 
 Some companies such as Outlier pay up to US$50 per hour, while another company called Labelbox said it pays up to US$200 per hour for “high expertise” subjects like quantum physics, but starts with US$15 for basic topics. 
 Invisible was founded in 2015 as a workflow-automation company catering to the likes of food delivery company DoorDash to digitise their delivery menu. 
 But things changed when a relatively unknown research firm called OpenAI contacted them in the spring of 2022, ahead of the public launch of ChatGPT.
 “OpenAI came to us with a problem, which is that when you were asking an early version of ChatGPT a question, it was going to hallucinate. You couldn’t trust the answer,” Pedraza told Reuters.
 “They needed an advanced AI training partner to provide reinforcement learning with human feedback,” Pedraza said.
 OpenAI did not respond to request for comment. Generative AI (GenAI) produces new content based on past data used to train it. 
 However, sometimes it can’t distinguish between true and false information and generates false outputs known as hallucinations. 
 In one notable example, in 2023 a Google chatbot shared inaccurate information about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system in a promotional video.
 Hallucination problem
 AI companies are aware that hallucinations can derail GenAI’s attractiveness to businesses and are trying various ways to reduce it, including using human trainers to teach the concept of fact and fiction. 
 Since getting onboard with OpenAI, Invisible said it had become AI training partners to most of the GenAI companies, including Cohere, AI21 and Microsoft. Cohere and AI21 confirmed they are clients. Microsoft did not confirm it is a client of Invisible.
 “These are all companies that had training challenges, where their number one cost was compute power, and then the number two cost is quality training,” Pedraza said.
 OpenAI, which started off the frenzy around GenAI, has a team of researchers aptly named “Human Data Team” that works with AI trainers to gather specialised data for training its models like ChatGPT.
 OpenAI researchers come up with various experiments like reducing hallucinations or to improve writing style and work with AI trainers from Invisible and other vendors, a source familiar with the company’s processes said.
 At any point, dozens of experiments are being run, some with tools developed by OpenAI and others by tools of vendors, the person said.
 Based on what the AI companies want – from getting better at Swedish history or doing financial modelling – Invisible hires workers with relevant degrees for those projects, reducing the burden of managing hundreds of trainers by the AI companies. 
 “OpenAI has some of the most incredible computer scientists in the world but they’re not necessarily an expert in Swedish history or chemistry questions or biology questions or anything you can ask it,” Pedraza said, adding that over 1,000 contract workers cater to OpenAI alone.
 Cohere’s Zhang said he has personally used Invisible’s trainers to find a way to teach its GenAI model to find relevant information from a big data set.
 Competition
 Among the competitors in this space is Scale AI, a private start-up last valued at US$14bil which provides AI companies with sets of training data. 
 It has also ventured into the area of providing AI trainers, and counts OpenAI as a customer. 
 Scale AI did not respond to requests for an interview for this story. 
 Invisible, which has been profitable since 2021, has raised only US$8mil of primary capital. 
 “We are 70% owned by the team, and only 30% owned by investors,” Pedraza said. “We do facilitate secondary rounds, and the most recent traded price was at a half a billion US dollar valuation,” he added.
 Reuters could not confirm that valuation. 
 Human trainers first got into AI training through data-labelling work that required less qualification and was also paid less, sometimes as low as US$2, mostly done by people in African and Asian countries.
 As AI companies launch more advanced models, the demand for specialised trainers and across dozens of languages is on the rise, creating a well-paid niche where workers from a variety of subjects could become AI trainers without even knowing how to code.
 Demand from AI companies is leading to the creation of more companies that are offering similar services. — Reuters",stockholm artificial intelligence model rival cohere spit human response vast team low cost worker model distinguish basic image car carrot update model competitive arena network human trainer knowledge historian scientist degree undergraduate cohere founder ivan zhang internal human trainer physician model medical environment financial analyst accountant bil startup invisible tech main rival specialises business invisible tech thousand trainer main partner company microsoft train model error hallucination people country master degree holder specialist invisible founder francis pedraza invisible pay hour location worker complexity company hour company labelbox pay hour expertise quantum physic start basic topic invisible workflow automation company like food delivery company doordash digitise delivery menu unknown firm spring public launch chatgpt openai version chatgpt question hallucinate trust answer pedraza reuters training partner reinforcement human feedback pedraza respond request comment generative genai content data distinguish true false generates false output hallucination notable google chatbot inaccurate satellite picture earth solar system promotional video hallucination company aware hallucination genai attractiveness business human trainer concept fiction openai invisible partner genai company cohere microsoft cohere client microsoft client invisible company challenge compute power cost quality pedraza openai frenzy genai team researcher human data team trainer data training model openai researcher experiment hallucination style trainer invisible vendor source familiar company dozen experiment tool openai tool vendor person company swedish history financial invisible hire worker degree project burden hundred trainer company incredible computer scientist swedish history chemistry question question contract worker zhang invisible trainer genai model relevant data competition competitor space scale private start bil company data trainer count customer scale respond request interview story invisible profitable mil primary capital team investor pedraza facilitate secondary round price half dollar valuation reuters valuation human trainer data labelling qualification low people african asian country company advanced model trainer dozen language niche worker variety subject trainer code demand company creation company service reuters,"[(3, 0.9970731)]",3
734150,Main,7,30/09/2024,"Tap into AI technologies from China, urges Fahmi",,"BEIJING: Malaysia can explore and leverage emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies from China to suit conditions in Malaysia, says Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil (pic).
 During his working visit to China, he said these technologies are suitable for use in the telecommunications, media, broadcasting and film sectors.
 “I see many opportunities that we should explore and take advantage of, such as the opportunity to learn, observe, share experiences and adopt what we deem appropriate for Malaysia.
 “I find the technological aspects most intriguing because we came with an understanding of the challenges we face, and these could be some of the solutions we can benefit from,” he told Bernama.
 Fahmi, who arrived here on Sept 26, concluded his working visit yesterday and departed for South Korea to attend the GSMA Mobile 360 APAC conference.
 Citing an example, Fahmi said the joint-venture agreement between Altel and Geespace on satellite technology, particularly direct-to-cell technology, could provide an ideal solution to improve connectivity in remote areas.
 Additionally, Fahmi highlighted that real-time translation technology could also be utilised, particularly in the film industry, to attract a larger audience that speaks different languages. 
 His visit to China Media Group, a pioneer in 8K ultra-high-definition broad­casting, also offered new insights into broadcasting technology and how AI could be leveraged for production purposes.
 Fahmi said he observed many potential opportunities, such as creating exportable content to China, including micro-dramas under one minute in length, which are increasingly popular in the country.
 In this connection, he encouraged media agencies, particularly Radio Television Malaysia, the Malaysian National News Agency and the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia to accelerate content creation and reporting to promote the uniqueness of Malaysia and attract tourists from China. 
 While in China, Fahmi held bilateral meetings with China’s National Radio and Television Administration Minister Cao Shumin as well as Industry and Information Technology Minister Jin Zhuanglong.
 During his meeting with Cao, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for cooperation in media and broadcasting, involving the exchange of tourism, food, culture and economic content.
 Fahmi also witnessed the signing of an MOU between a Malaysian mobile network operator and a Chinese telecommunications company, aiming to provide comprehensive technological solutions such as fast mobile coverage through 5G networks.",malaysia leverage artificial intelligence technology suit condition communication minister fadzil pic visit china technology suitable telecommunication medium film sector opportunity advantage opportunity share experience deem malaysia technological aspect understanding challenge solution told bernama fahmi visit yesterday south korea attend gsma mobile apac conference fahmi joint venture agreement altel geespace satellite technology direct cell technology ideal solution connectivity real time translation technology utilised film industry attract larger audience speaks china medium pioneer ultra definition broad casting insight technology leveraged production purpose potential opportunity exportable content china micro drama minute length popular country connection medium agency television malaysia malaysian national news agency national film development corporation malaysia accelerate content creation promote uniqueness malaysia attract tourist china fahmi bilateral meeting national radio television administration minister shumin industry technology minister jin meeting cao party memorandum mou cooperation medium exchange tourism food culture economic content fahmi mou malaysian mobile network operator chinese telecommunication company comprehensive technological solution mobile coverage network,"[(2, 0.17750537), (6, 0.81774056)]",6
732798,StarMetro,4,27/09/2024,AI hub to help S’gor SMEs,State government to build facility with cloud partners,"AN Artificial Intelligence (AI) centre will be set up in Selangor to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) embrace the technology.
 The move will be under the state’s 2025 budget, said Selangor Islamic and cultural innovation committee chairman Dr Mohammad Fahmi Ngah.
 Speaking at the Selangor 2025 Budget dialogue session, he said the AI infrastructure centre would be built in collaboration with cloud partners.
 The dialogue session was launched by Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, where five group discussions took place simultaneously.
 The topics were AI, sustainable revenue, state sustainability, public welfare and housing.
 “We talk about small and medium-sized entrepreneurs adopting AI but there seems to be scarce use of AI, due to the cost. We will be setting up the AI centre to help you,” Mohammad Fahmi said during his speech during the AI dialogue session.
 He said the state realised that there were also gaps in terms of AI adoption within the state government management itself.
 “SMEs may have funding limitations to embark on AI technologies, so we will do a match-fund model where we will pay some money and you match that to solve your problem using our facilities. 
 “This will help bring down the cost,” he said.
 He welcomed at least 30 “use cases”, a term used in system analysis to identify and organise the system requirements.
 “We need industry use cases. The SMEs can use local or foreign talents, that is entirely up to them.” 
 Elaborating on this to StarMetro, Mohammad Fahmi  said, “Ideally, they source talent locally from our universities. 
 “Our students here will then be able to use the AI centre with the foreign AI technology to solve industry problems.”
 He said AI technology could also be used to manage floods better, via sharing of information from multiple agencies and making information available at one centre.
 “For instance, if there is a lack of an item such as mattresses in Kuala Selangor, we should have an AI system whereby we can quickly locate the nearest place that has mattresses and dispatch them to the flooded location immediately,” he cited.
 He said other simple cases would be digitising meeting minutes to save time.
 “At the moment it takes about a month for a meeting’s minutes to be prepared. 
 We do not have AI system that can help with this, that is fast and accurate,” he said.
 “Another example is facial recognition for attendance at work,” he added.
 Mohammad Fahmi said AI was not just about picking and choosing the best models from web services.
 “We need mathematicians, we need to build digital models and run those models. 
 “We also need the right data to train on the models. This is the core of AI that we require.”
 In his speech, Mohammad Fahmi also touched on Selangor expecting to achieve full 5G network coverage in all its populated areas by 2025.

732902,Main,4,27/09/2024,Anwar pushes for AI talent growth,,"JOHOR BARU: Malaysia needs to grow its talent pool and produce graduates in new fields such as artificial intelligence, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
 The Prime Minister spoke of being impressed to find out during his visit to Abu Dhabi that there was already a university teaching AI there.
 “They were able to do it within a short period,” he said.
 This led to him pursuing the matter with the Higher Education Ministry, he said, adding that it usually takes one or two years to start a new faculty.
 “However, it has now been done within four months by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in Johor,” he said in his speech at the Invest Malaysia event organised by Bursa Malaysia yesterday.
 Anwar spoke about a need to partner with the private sector to develop talent.
 “We lacked a niche in the highest level. So it is important for us to produce graduates who fulfil their requirements,” he added.
 He also touched on the importance to tap the Asean market for investments as the region had a huge population of 680 million and a GDP of US$3.5 trillion (RM14.7 trillion).
 On Singapore, he said both countries would continue to collaborate to achieve a win-win situation, including the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ).
 “Yes, we have our minor differences like any other country globally but we are still excited to work with each other,” he added.
 Malaysia, he said, was generating enough energy surplus to power new major development projects.
 He said the government would continue to pursue renewable energy and energy transition initiatives, as it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while still focusing on projects like JS-SEZ.
 Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said Johor’s strategic advantages and strong growth momentum made the state an unbeatable investment destination.
 “We are witnessing growing interest from investors, both locally and internationally.
 “Johor’s GDP growth outpaced the national average, expanding by 4.1% year-on-year in 2023, driven primarily by our thriving services and manufacturing sectors,” he said.
 Onn Hafiz noted that Johor recorded RM5.2bil in exports in July, with strong performances in petrochemicals, electronics and non-metallic materials.
 Later at another event in Kuala Lumpur, Anwar said he is ready to declare his assets right away if he is involved in any investigation. 
 “Some leaders, when they become the prime minister or the finance minister, they amassed hundreds of millions and some even up to billions of ringgit,” he said.
 “But when we asked them to declare their assets, they hold grudges.
 “If I were told to declare my assets tomorrow, I will declare it, probe me as much as you want,” he said at a groundbreaking ceremony for a school.
 Earlier yesterday, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dispelled allegations that Anwar had instructed the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to investigate former premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his sons, and former finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin. 
 According to a report by Bloomberg, the PMO also denied instructing MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki not to investigate share purchases by Anwar’s former political secretary Farhash Wafa Salvador. 
 “The Prime Minister’s Office affirms that the Prime Minister has never issued directives or interfered in investigations conducted by the MACC. The MACC operates as an independent body, acting on the basis of complaints received,” it said.",johor baru malaysia talent pool graduate field artificial intelligence datuk seri anwar ibrahim prime minister impressed visit abu dhabi university short period pursuing matter education ministry start faculty month universiti teknologi malaysia johor speech malaysia event bursa malaysia yesterday anwar partner private sector talent niche level graduate requirement tap asean market investment region huge population gdp singapore country collaborate win win situation johor special economic zone sez minor difference country malaysia energy surplus power major development project government pursue renewable energy energy transition initiative aim net emission project sez mentri besar datuk onn hafiz ghazi johor strategic advantage strong growth momentum unbeatable investment destination investor johor gdp growth national average driven service sector hafiz johor bil export strong performance petrochemical electronics metallic material event kuala anwar ready declare asset investigation leader minister finance minister hundred million billion declare asset grudge declare asset tomorrow declare probe ceremony school yesterday prime minister office pmo allegation malaysian anti corruption commission investigate premier tun mahathir mohamad son minister tun daim zainuddin report bloomberg pmo macc chief commissioner tan sri azam baki investigate share purchase political secretary farhash wafa salvador prime minister office affirms minister directive interfered investigation macc macc independent body basis complaint,"[(1, 0.64542675), (3, 0.35056248)]",1
733060,StarESG,28,27/09/2024,Enabling sustainable businesses via AI,,"THE rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries across the Asia Pacific, however it poses uncharted waters for many, especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). 
 StarESG explores the potential of AI and why it’s the new way of doing business, with liquid cooling technology expert Vertiv (M) Sdn Bhd – which provides a comprehensive solution for managing data centre heat by reducing energy consumption, enhancing efficiency and supporting scalable systems. 
 The company’s High Density Compute and AI business director for Asia, Alvin Cheang provided greater insights on AI’s role in sustainability.
 How can artificial intelligence (AI) technologies contribute to creating a more inclusive society?  
 Vertiv recognises the transformative potential of AI in bridging the digital divide and empowering underserved communities. 
 By personalising learning experiences and developing assistive technologies, AI can improve access to education and enable individuals with disabilities to participate more fully in society. 
 Moreover, AI’s ability to analyse vast amounts of data can help identify and address critical social issues, such as poverty and limited healthcare access. 
 As a company, we are committed to leveraging new technologies like AI to enhance our collaboration with customers, consultants and partners. 
 In what ways can AI be used to bridge the digital divide and ensure equal access to opportunities? 
 We recognise the immense potential of AI to transform various aspects of society, from bridging the digital divide and empowering underserved communities to enhancing connectivity, education, healthcare and language accessibility. 
 By leveraging AI technologies, we can optimise network infrastructure, personalise learning experiences, facilitate remote healthcare services, break down language barriers, and promote financial inclusion. 
 Moreover, AI has the power to reduce human biases in critical decision-making processes, such as hiring, lending and resource allocation. 
 AI is not merely a technology but an ecosystem that requires collaboration among governments, stakeholders and industry partners to drive digitisation and optimise its use in various sectors, such as traffic control. 
 How can SMEs leverage AI technologies to enhance their competitiveness and drive growth?
 We have observed that organisations with enterprise data centres are diversifying their investments and deployment strategies, particularly in AI, to meet sustainability objectives. 
 This shift is expected to impact edge application deployments and the overall IT landscape. 
 On-premise capacity for proprietary AI and optimising existing infrastructure through incremental investment, service, and maintenance can help organisations free up capacity in maxed-out computing environments and increase energy efficiency. 
 Moreover, extending the life of existing servers can reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions, as opposed to replacing and scrapping them. 
 AI can also help SMEs strengthen their cybersecurity defences by detecting and responding to potential threats in real-time through AI-powered security systems that analyse network traffic, identify anomalies, and proactively mitigate risks. 
 Vertiv Asia vice president and general manager Paul Churchill said, “Across Asia, we’re seeing organisations ramp up their investments, realigning their strategies towards harnessing and integrating AI technology. In fact, according to IDC, by 2026, tech providers will allocate significant investments towards AI/automation.” 
 SMEs can start small and achieve AI applications or adopt AI technologies by leasing cost-effective AI cloud services from key leaders like Alibaba, AWS and Microsoft Cloud. 
 Dedicated servers, which are affordable and price-sensitive AI servers, are also available in the market. 
 What challenges do SMEs face when adopting AI, and how can these challenges be overcome?
 SMEs may face various challenges when adopting AI technologies, including financial constraints, lack of knowledge and skills, ethical and legal considerations, and access to high-quality data. 
 To overcome financial barriers, SMEs can collaborate with government agencies, industry associations, or financial institutions to secure funding support, grants, or loans for AI adoption. 
 Addressing the knowledge and skills gap requires investment in AI education programmes, workshops and collaboration with universities or AI service providers. 
 SMEs should also prioritise ethical considerations, adopt transparent models, collaborate with legal experts, stay updated with regulations, and comply with data protection laws to build trust and ensure responsible AI adoption. 
 Effective communication, employee training and demonstrating AI benefits can help overcome resistance to change.
 To tackle data-related challenges, SMEs can partner with larger organisations or data providers, collaborate with data analytics companies, and invest in data management systems. 
 How does Vertiv’s scaling/cooling solutions support the AI infrastructure requirements of SMEs and large corporations?
 Vertiv offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for scalable AI infrastructure, including prefabricated modular solutions that can be combined and scaled to meet current and future needs. 
 We also provide a wide range of cooling solutions for AI and high-performance computing, such as rear door heat exchangers, direct-to-chip liquid cooling, coolant distribution units, high-capacity free-cooling chillers, and large capacity chilled water-based prefabricated modular data centre solutions. 
 The optimised designs minimise disruption to existing workloads by leveraging available cooling infrastructure and heat rejection. 
 Vertiv’s solutions also offer flexibility and customisation by reusing or retrofitting existing cooling systems, reducing deployment costs and allowing for more efficient AI infrastructure implementation.
 What are the key considerations for SMEs when implementing AI technologies to ensure scalability and efficiency?
 When SMEs implement AI technologies, they need to ensure their infrastructure is ready to scale and operate efficiently. 
 This involves assessing and possibly upgrading their current IT infrastructure to handle increased computational power and storage demands. Investing in scalable solutions, such as cloud services and modular data centres, can provide the necessary flexibility as AI initiatives expand. 
 Additionally, ensuring the infrastructure’s reliability through redundant systems, backup power solutions, and efficient cooling systems is crucial to minimise downtime and maintain continuous operations. 
 Data management is another critical aspect, where the focus should be on maintaining high-quality, secure data with strong governance frameworks. 
 Advanced storage solutions optimised for fast data retrieval and processing are essential to support AI applications. 
 Cost management also plays a significant role; SMEs should plan their investments carefully, starting with smaller projects then gradually scaling up
 They should also consider long-term operational costs, including maintenance, energy consumption, and potential upgrades. 
 Energy-efficient infrastructure can help mitigate ongoing costs, making the adoption of AI more sustainable.
 What role does sustainability play in the deployment of AI technologies, and how does Vertiv address this aspect in its scaling/cooling solutions?
 Vertiv recognises the importance of sustainability in AI deployments as the data centre industry faces challenges in addressing energy consumption, costs and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 To support the growing demand for AI capabilities and the need for innovative power and cooling infrastructure, Vertiv offers end-to-end AI power and cooling solutions that simplify data centre infrastructure selection and deployment.

732554,StarBiz,15,26/09/2024,"AI market will surge to nearly US$1 trillion by 2027, Bain says",,"NEW YORK: The global market for artificial intelligence (AI)-related products is ballooning and will hit as much as US$990bil in 2027, as the technology’s quick adoption disrupts companies and economies, Bain & Co says.
 The market, including AI-related services and hardware, will grow 40% to 55% annually from US$185bil last year, the consulting firm said in its fifth annual Global Technology Report released yesterday. 
 That will lead to revenue of US$780bil to US$990bil, Bain said.
 The growth will be fuelled by bigger AI systems and larger data centres to train and run them, driven by companies and governments using the technology to boost efficiency. 
 Demand is rising so fast that it’ll strain supply chains for components, including chips needed to run the services, Bain said. 
 Combined with geopolitical tensions, rising sales could trigger shortages in semiconductors, personal computers and smartphones, Bain warned.
 Demand for upstream chip components such as integrated circuit design and related IP could rise 30% or more by 2026, putting pressure on manufacturers, Bain said. 
 The cost of larger data centres could jump from US$1bil to US$4bil now to between US$10bil and US$25bil in five years, as their capacity expands to more than a gigawatt from 50 to 200 megawatts currently, it said.
 “These changes are expected to have huge implications on the ecosystems that support data centres, including infrastructure engineering, power production and cooling,” the consultancy said.
 Companies are moving beyond an experimentation phase and beginning to scale generative AI across their operations. 
 Small language models, similar to the large language models that led to the creation of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, but lightweight and efficient, could be favoured by enterprises and countries.
 This comes amid concerns surrounding costs and data privacy.

732386,Main,9,25/09/2024,AI strikes a chord,"Candidates go high-tech to compose songs, engage voters","KLUANG: Crafting catchy campaign songs is one way artificial intelligence (AI) is boosting the campaigns of rival parties in the Mahkota by-election but experts caution against abusing the technology for spreading lies.
 Barisan Nasional candidate Syed Hussien Syed Abdullah and his rival from Perikatan Nasional Mohamad Haizan Jaafar each had their own songs composed using AI technology, coalition officials said. 
 Barisan and Umno Youth chief Dr Muhamad Akmal Salleh said the coalition’s song for Mahkota was created using AI in less than a day.
 “It took just one night. The song was created on nomination day and has been played since Sept 15.
 “The song is catchy and has gained traction on TikTok. Some children here even sing ‘Hussien, Hussien’ (the song’s chorus) when they see our candidate,” he told reporters while on the campaign trail.
 The song has also been translated into Mandarin and Tamil with the help of party leaders.
 “They reviewed the lyrics, sentence structure and pronunciation ... to ensure everything was accurate before we started using it,” said Dr Muhamad Akmal.
 Johor Perikatan Youth chief Ahmad Nawfal Mahfodz said the coalition saved lots of time by using AI to compose the song for Mohamad Haizan.
 “We came up with the main points and message we wanted the song to convey. It took some time to input these ideas, but once done, the AI created the song,” he said.
 “It used to take at least two weeks to compose a song, but now it can be done in less than two days,” he said, adding that AI is a “positive tool when used ethically”.
 Both candidates and their campaign workers are leveraging on social media to reach out to outstation voters to persuade them to return on polling day this Saturday. 
 Barisan is using community WhatsApp groups in Mahkota to reach as many residents as possible before polling day, said Syed Hussien.
 Perikatan meanwhile is focused on creating attractive messages on Facebook and TikTok to get younger voters to turnout in large numbers, said Mohamad Haizan, adding that a multifaceted approach was important. 
 Malaysia Cyber Consumer Association president Siraj Jalil said the use of AI in this by-election reflects how quickly technological developments are reshaping election campaigns.
 “I’m confident that the next general election in Malaysia will look very different from past elections. The Mahkota by-election is a good indication of this,” he said when contacted.
 In the future, political parties may also use AI tools such as ChatGPT to generate campaign narratives and counter-arguments, he said.   
 So far, Siraj has not detected any significant use of technology to spread disinformation or misinformation.
 “This is a good sign, and we should embrace it. I do not condone the use of AI for ill intentions,” he said.
 The by-election was triggered when its incumbent Datuk Sharifah Azizah Syed Zain of Umno died on Aug 2, three days after being hospitalised.

731868,StarBiz,15,24/09/2024,Lula to lead push for  AI rules at G20 summit,Brazil champions the interests of Global South,"BRASILIA: As the planet’s largest economies struggle to forge consensus on the future of artificial intelligence (AI), Brazil premiere Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants to ensure the developing world isn’t left out of the debate.
 The Brazilian leader has added AI to his list of priorities for his country’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) nations this year, seizing on the position to try to shape regulatory discussions that are raging from Europe to Asia to the United Nations (UN), where the technology is expected to be a major theme of this week’s General Assembly.
 Already seeking reforms to global institutions like the UN Security Council, Lula wants to use November’s G20 leaders’ summit to craft a governance framework that includes the interests of Global South nations and forces AI superpowers China and the United States to the table, according to two people familiar with his views.
 “The big challenge is reducing inequalities, because there is already inequality today,” Luciana Santos, Brazil’s Science and Technology Minister said in an interview with Bloomberg News. 
 “We want to reduce this within countries and to do this we need to encourage the development of AI, especially for countries in the Global South.”
 Doing so won’t be easy, and not just because Lula will have to convince nations battling for position in the technological arms race that Brazil, whose AI capabilities and regulations lag those of other G20 members, is the right country to lead the conversation.
 The G20 is also in the midst of an identity crisis as two major wars and fierce economic competition divide its most powerful members. 
 Reaching consensus on any topic, much less one as complex as AI, has proven increasingly difficult in that climate, as Lula’s efforts to craft a global tax on billionaires has already demonstrated. 
 And even if it does succeed in developing a framework, Brazil will have to convince nations to adhere to the guidelines to prevent it from becoming just another G20 resolution with little real-world force.
 No matter the challenges, Lula has embraced the issue as part of a career-long campaign to position himself as a leader of the Global South, one who can use Brazil’s relative power to give developing nations a voice on major issues.
 His priority is an agreement on baseline standards of governance that give a wide range of countries a say in who gains access to AI and its benefits. 
 Advisers cite his desire to avoid a repeat of the global divide in nuclear technology, in which a handful of nations have an outsize advantage over those that lack access to such weapons. 
 Brazil is also pressing members to mitigate potential workforce disruptions from AI, create ways to safeguard intellectual property and address the military use of AI as it begins to appear on battlefields in Ukraine and the Middle East, according to one of the people familiar with his views.
 Lula is answering calls from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has repeatedly stressed that new AI rules shouldn’t be developed solely by rich nations.
 So far, they largely have been. China has implemented strict guidelines on the technology, while the European Union approved a comprehensive rulebook that bans AI use in some cases and restricts other applications considered “high-risk.” 
 President Joe Biden has called for strong AI regulations, but the US has yet to produce them.
 China and the United States, meanwhile, have largely monopolised AI initiatives at the UN, with each successfully pitching their own General Assembly resolutions on the issue this year. 
 “To truly harness AI’s potential, we need international cooperation and solidarity,” Guterres said this month in China. 
 “The risks posed by AI are equally uneven.

 This promising position reflects Vietnam’s significant potential, not just within the region but on a global scale, as highlighted by GenAI Fund partner  Denning Tan at the Asean GenAI Start-up Report Launch Roadshow in Hanoi last week.
 The event was hosted by GenAI Fund, the first South-East Asia-based Gen AI investment fund, in partnership with Amazon Web Services, Databricks and Vietnam’s National Innovation Centre (NIC). 
 It aimed to provide crucial insights into the rapidly evolving Gen AI ecosystem across South-East Asia.
 Tan emphasised that the Asean GenAI Start-up Report 2024, based on surveys across six countries, outlines the trends, opportunities and resources shaping the future of Gen AI in the region. 
 The report surveyed 500 startups over three months, offering data-driven insights for startups, governments and businesses on how Gen AI technologies are transforming industries across Asean, with Vietnam emerging as a critical innovation hub.
 “Vietnam is becoming an important Gen AI development hub in Asean,” Tan said.
 He predicted that Vietnam’s share of Gen AI startups in the region would rise from 27% to 35%, moving closer to Singapore’s position. 
 Tan noted Vietnam’s advantages, including its skilled technical talent and culture of rapid product development.
 “Our research indicates that Vietnam is well-positioned in the Gen AI space. 
 “The combination of government support, strong technical education and entrepreneurial spirit creates favourable conditions for Gen AI innovation in Vietnam.”
 NIC deputy director Do Tien Thinh stressed the fundamental role of AI in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which drives advancements in productivity, competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. 
 He noted that AI, particularly Gen AI, is breaking new ground, offering unprecedented possibilities for humanity. 
 AI is now applied across various sectors, from healthcare and education to manufacturing and agriculture.
 The Vietnamese government recognises AI’s importance and has implemented several policies to promote its research, development and uses. 
 In line with this, the Ministry of Planning and Investment has submitted a proposal to the prime minister to develop a semiconductor workforce, aiming to have at least 5,000 engineers with AI expertise by 2030.
 Additionally, the NIC has been tasked with establishing an AI-focused research and training centre, targeting the development of 7,000 AI experts and incubating 500 AI startups by 2030.
 At the event, three pioneering Gen AI startups in Vietnam – Reforged Labs, Lex Engine and Laka.ai – showcased innovative applications.

731726,Main,22,23/09/2024,AI joins search for valuable metals,,"PEERING into their computer screens in California last year, the data crunchers watched a subterranean fortune come into focus.
 What they saw transported them 16,000km across the world, to Zambia, and then 1.6km straight down into Earth. A rich lode of copper, deep in the bedrock, appeared before them, its contours revealed by a complex artificial intelligence-driven technology they had been painstakingly building for years.
 On July 11, their company, KoBold Metals, informed its business partners that their find is likely the largest copper discovery in more than a decade.
 According to their estimates, reviewed by The New York Times, the mine would produce at least 300,000 tons of copper a year once fully operational. That corresponds to a value of billions of dollars a year, for decades.
 The Times also reviewed an independent, third-party assessment of KoBold’s claims, which, while slightly more conservative than KoBold’s own, largely corroborated the size of the deposit.
 In a statement, KoBold said it expected the value of the mine to grow because it had yet to map the full extent of its highest-grade ore.
 It’s the first confirmed success for a company that hopes to radically transform the way we find metals critical not only to the tech industry but to the fight against climate change.
 The geopolitical significance is vast. KoBold’s find comes as the United States and China are increasingly clashing over global access to the minerals needed to manufacture clean energy technologies.
 KoBold originated a half-decade ago in the belated realisation among Silicon Valley’s barons of what lay ahead.
 Their products had become the backbone of the US economy. 
 But their businesses couldn’t grow much further without a gargantuan increase in the mining of a handful of raw materials that make batteries, without which everything from cellphones to electric trucks simply can’t function. They needed far more copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel.
 Hundreds of new mines would be necessary, analysts calculated. And not just for consumer products, but for the house-size lithium-ion batteries needed for backup on the nation’s power grids as solar and wind power ebbs and flows.
 AI data centres demand huge amounts of copper. Advanced weaponry requires nickel and cobalt.
 Over two decades of production, KoBold’s find in Zambia would yield enough copper for 100 million of today’s average-size electric vehicle batteries.
 “The more you realise how dependent we are on these technologies, the more you ask: how the hell were we so slow to the fact that we needed vast amounts of raw material to make it all possible?” said Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the biggest venture capital firm in the United States and an early investor in KoBold.
 The traditional mining industry lacked a convincing solution. Using exploration techniques largely unchanged in a century, the cost of new discoveries was rising while the pace of the finds slowed.
 Around the same time, the US government had a similar lightbulb moment. America had become far too reliant on China for these essential resources.
 China had been heavily investing in global mining and metal processing, and controlled the production of 20% to 80% of its supply chains. The United States, on the other hand, has relatively few processing plants or mines, domestic or foreign, for most battery metals.
 The International Energy Forum, a research organisation, recently estimated that the world would need between 35 and 194 large new mines for copper alone through 2050. That translates to between one and six new copper mines, every year, the size of the one KoBold plans to dig in Zambia.
 Investors from American and European private equity funds that collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets, including ones started by Silicon Valley giants such as Bill Gates and Sam Altman of OpenAI, were joined by more traditional industrial companies in putting hundreds of millions of dollars into KoBold.
 It already has 60-odd exploration projects in various countries. In some cases, such as Zambia, where production is expected to begin in the early 2030s, it plans to own stakes in the mines themselves.
 Its CEO and co-founder, Kurt House, embraces the moneymaking potential of KoBold’s technology, which is the company’s alone to profit from. He is fond of saying, “I don’t need to be reminded again that I’m a capitalist.”
 The work is about to get a lot less theoretical.
 KoBold is pumping US$2.3bil into its first mine and is negotiating tricky partnerships with contractors and governments alike. It is relying on the US government to finance a new railway to export the copper. And, like the mining barons of yore, its leaders will soon be exposed to the social and environmental trade-offs that almost all mining poses.
  KoBold’s find looks like a proof of concept with potentially huge payout for investors. And the company’s partners include Zambia itself: the state mining company owns 20%.
 That Zambians will benefit, though, is far from a foregone conclusion.
 Mining has left waste piled across Copperbelt province, spawning lawsuits. One case alleges that local rivers at one point ran bright blue with copper tailings. And despite a century of mining, Zambia remains one of the world’s least-developed and most-indebted countries.
 “The value of copper that has left Zambia is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Hold that figure in your mind, and then look around yourself in Zambia,” said Grieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist. 
 “The link between resource and benefit is severed.”
 KoBold’s team is still determining exactly where to dig the mine’s shaft. There is a lake directly above the ore, and a major highway, along with the village of Kawama.
 “For a find this valuable, there’s nothing on the surface we can’t move,” said George Gilchrist, a South African geologist who is leading KoBold’s exploration in Zambia.
 In an interview in the capital, Lusaka, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema said one way to ensure greater benefits was for his country to own more of the mine.
 He said he was pressing KoBold to increase the share owned by the state mining company to above one-third. The extra money “will allow us to invest in sectors that ordinarily are difficult for us,” he said.
 Hichilema is desperate for revenue.
 More than one-third of his budget goes toward repaying international debts, leaving little for health and education.
 Most of the capital gets only a few hours of electricity per day. It will take more than a slightly bigger stake in one mine, however large the mine may be, to solve that.
 “The benefits of this mine for Zambia,” Chelwa said, “are purely theoretical at this point.”
 For the US government, the benefits are far more clear.
 “We are the American beachhead in Africa,” said Jennifer Fendrick, KoBold’s director for government affairs. “And that’s how the government sees it.”
 Before joining KoBold, she was a senior US State Department strategist on critical minerals.
 Although the US government hasn’t directly invested in KoBold, it is partially underwriting a US$2.3bil railway to the Angolan coast from Copperbelt province, enabling copper to be more easily be shipped to the United States.
 It’s the United States’ single-biggest investment to catch up to China in Africa’s battery-metal sweepstakes.
 There are other ways the United States could procure battery metals, but they face big obstacles.
 Parts of the seabed are rich in critical minerals, but a dispute has raged for years over how, or whether, oceans should be mined. And more mines could be opened within the United States itself, but that prospect has drawn objections, particularly from indigenous communities.
 Whether the United States sticks with its climate goals also hinges on this year’s presidential election. A win by former pre­sident Donald Trump would very likely severely curtail energy transition incentives.For now, the Biden administration is pushing ahead.
 “We need 25 times as much cobalt as we currently mine,” Jose Fernandez, the State Department’s top energy official, said in an interview recently, not to mention all the other metals and minerals reshaping the global economy.

731196,StarHealth,5,22/09/2024,Doctors using AI without proper guidance,,"A FIFTH of family doctors (general practitioners or GPs) seem to have readily incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) into their clinical practice, despite a lack of any formal guidance or clear work policies on the use of these tools, suggest the findings of an online UK-wide snapshot survey, published in the open access journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics.
 Doctors and medical trainees need to be fully informed about the pros and cons of AI, especially because of the inherent risks of inaccuracies (‘hallucinations’), algorithmic biases, and the potential to compromise patient privacy, conclude the researchers.
 Following the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, interest in large language model-powered chatbots has soared, and attention has increasingly focused on the clinical potential of these tools, say the researchers.
 To gauge current use of chatbots to assist with any aspect of clinical practice in the United Kingdom, in February 2024 the researchers distributed an online survey to a randomly chosen sample of GPs registered with  the clinician marketing service Doctors.net.uk. 
 The survey had a predetermined sample size of 1,000.
 The doctors were asked if they had ever used any of the following in any aspect of their clinical practice: ChatGPT; Bing AI; Google’s Bard; or ‘Other’. 
 And they were subsequently asked what they used these tools for.
 Some 1,006 GPs completed the survey: just over half the responses came from men (531; 53%) and a similar proportion of respondents (544; 54%) were aged 46 or older.
 One in five (205; 20%) respondents reported using generative AI tools in their clinical practice. 
 Of this, more than one in four (29%; 47) reported using these tools to generate documentation after patient appointments and a similar proportion (28%; 45) said they used them to suggest a differential diagnosis. 
 One in four (25%; 40) said they used the tools to suggest treatment options.
 The researchers acknowledge that the survey respondents may not be representative of all UK GPs, and that those who responded may have been particularly interested in AI – for good or bad – potentially introducing a level of bias into the findings. 
 Further research is needed to find out more about how doctors are using generative AI and how best to implement these tools safely and securely into clinical practice, they add.
 “These findings signal that GPs may derive value from these tools, particularly with administrative tasks and to support clinical reasoning. 
 “However, we caution that these tools have limitations since they can embed subtle errors and biases,” they say.
 And they point out: “(These tools) may also risk harm and undermine patient privacy since it is not clear how the internet companies behind generative AI use the information they gather.
 “While these chatbots are increasingly the target of regulatory efforts, it remains unclear how the legislation will intersect in a practical way with these tools in clinical practice.”
 They conclude: “The medical community will need to find ways to both educate physicians and trainees about the potential benefits of these tools in summarising information but also the risks in terms of hallucinations (perception of non-existent patterns or objects), algorithmic biases, and the potential to  compromise patient privacy.”",family doctor practitioner artificial intelligence clinical practice lack formal guidance policy finding wide snapshot survey access journal bmj health care informatics doctor medical trainee pro con inherent risk inaccuracy hallucination potential compromise patient privacy conclude researcher chatgpt language model chatbots attention clinical potential tool researcher current chatbots aspect clinical practice kingdom february researcher online survey sample gps clinician marketing service doctor net survey sample size doctor clinical practice chatgpt google bard gps survey half proportion respondent respondent generative tool clinical practice tool generate documentation patient appointment differential diagnosis tool treatment option researcher survey respondent representative gps bad level bias finding doctor implement tool clinical practice finding signal gps derive tool administrative task clinical caution tool limitation subtle error tool risk undermine patient privacy internet company gather chatbots regulatory effort unclear legislation intersect practical tool clinical practice conclude medical community physician potential benefit tool risk term hallucination perception existent pattern algorithmic bias potential compromise patient privacy,"[(1, 0.9941422)]",1
731224,StarEdu,7,22/09/2024,Learning with an ‘AI buddy’,Virtual teaching assistants enhance student engagement with customised support,"We live in a digital world where the modern workforce increasingly relies on digital innovations to drive solutions, generate new content, and harness transformative technologies that can redefine industries. 
 This calls for an educational approach that prepares our graduates for a rapidly changing world, equipping them with adaptability and tech-savviness – skills highly valued by employers.
 Universities, in particular, need to move away from traditional passive knowledge dissemination to dynamic, interactive learning experiences that empower students to take ownership of their educational journey. 
 This approach cultivates curiosity, self-directed learning, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, enabling students to thrive in a technology-driven world.
 The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies has transformed the way students receive personalised assistance and support, making it a revolutionary development in education. 
 Imagine if every university lecturer had an AI counterpart available to their students 24/7. This long-awaited goal in online learning is becoming a reality, making personalised learning accessible to every student.
 These AI doubles, more commonly known as virtual teaching assistants, will “work closely” with the lecturers to handle routine tasks, such as generating quizzes, providing personalised feedback on assignments, offering immediate assistance, answering questions, and clarifying doubts in real time – allowing lecturers to focus more on direct student interaction, ultimately providing targeted support for every student. This is an example where learning with AI can be better than reality.
 For students, the use of an AI buddy in learning could enhance their engagement, as they will receive customised support in various ways. 
 An AI buddy can create personalised content tailored to each student’s learning preferences. By integrating dynamic conversation prompts based on student responses, an AI buddy can foster a deeper understanding, encourage critical thinking, and help students connect concepts to real-world issues.
 Additionally, an AI buddy can track students’ progress in the learning management system, and increase learning outcomes with enhanced and personalised feedback. 
 For instance, lecturers could use rubric-based AI grading to evaluate student responses in assignments, offering tailored feedback for improvement to each student.
 However, adopting AI in education at the university level presents several challenges. If students do not use generative AI (GenAI) responsibly, it may lead to a compromise in the attainment of learning outcomes and eventually affect the quality of graduates.
 Students need to understand the limitations of GenAI technology. It is not perfect and can produce false or illogical information. 
 In certain circumstances, GenAI may lack discernment and be unable to distinguish between right and wrong information. It can fabricate information and generate fictitious references to non-existent texts.
 Furthermore, students are not allowed to submit work generated by AI as their own without proper attribution, as this constitutes academic dishonesty and is equivalent to cheating. The use of GenAI must be referenced appropriately according to the referencing style required by their lecturers.
 Students should consult their course instructors about the expectations regarding the use of GenAI for learning tasks or assessments. 
 They are responsible for checking and verifying the results generated by AI against other sources, acknowledging the contribution of GenAI technology, and being accountable for any errors or omissions.
 Lastly, the ethical consideration in embracing GenAI in education involves the privacy and security of students’ data. GenAI often relies on large language models and requires massive amounts of data to train the model effectively. The deployment of AI in education must prevent unauthorised or unintended usage of sensitive personal information and academic records from students.
 Universities must also implement robust ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from students for data usage, and ensuring students have the option to opt out of any data collection by the AI system. 
 It is also crucial for universities to ensure their AI systems are trained with transparent algorithms, and are regularly audited for responsible and optimal use of GenAI.

730994,Main,6,21/09/2024,Keeping AI use in check,Govt launches code of ethics to rein in fast-growing tech,"PUTRAJAYA: To put a stop to comments like it “sounds like me, looks like me but it is not me”, the government has launched a code of ethics to ensure artificial intelligence (AI) is used ethically, says Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof.
 The Deputy Prime Minister said the code of ethics, known as the Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines (AIGE), is a framework for setting parameters for AI users and also serves as a regulatory measure for responsible development and adoption of AI technology. 
 The government will also start a National Artificial Intelligence Office (NAIO) in November and the formation of a Data Commission is in the works. 
 Fadillah said this after launching the AIGE here yesterday with Science, Technology and Inno­vation Minister Chang Lih Kang and Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo. 
 “It is important to apply the AIGE to ensure that there is transparency and accountability at every level of AI as proof of the government’s commitment to further build the trust of the public towards this technology.  
 “We must ensure that all decisions taken by an AI system are based on accurate data and free of bias which will corrode justice and fairness.
 “These guidelines also stress privacy and personal data protection of users, as data is now a valuable commodity. 
 “We must ensure that the rights to privacy of all individuals are always respected and protected, including how data is collected, stored and used by the AI system,” Fadillah said. 
 He cautioned the need for the government to be wary of the social and economic implications of AI which could replace manpower and increase unemployment. 
 “It is important to educate the younger generation on the potentials and risks of AI. 
 “Early education on ethics in technology should be made part of the education curriculum to enable children to be technology-literate and responsible in the usage of technology,” Fadillah said. 
 Chang said while AIGE would not be imposed on the private sector, it would be the first step towards enacting legislation in the space. 
 “The AIGE is not a law per se, but a guideline. We hope that some parts of the guidelines can be taken up as law but this (process) will take time. 
 “Before we move to enact legislation, we hope AIGE can be made a reference by all AI industry players to enable them to comply and discipline themselves. 
 “The current laws are enough to curb scams, but AI is advancing very quickly and we need a reference to make sure that everyone abides by a set of guidelines. 
 “This is the start of a process. Just like teaching children morals, we cannot enforce everything that we teach,” Chang said. 
 He said that he would discuss with the Education Ministry to incorporate these guidelines in school curriculums as children need to understand the ethics of AI. 
 He added that the AIGE would be updated in line with technological advancements.
 Earlier in his speech, Chang said the market value of AI in Malaysia this year was projected to reach RM1.5bil, with JP Morgan Research predicting the Gross Domestic Product of the world economy to expand by 10% – between US$7 trillion and US$10 trillion – over the next few years.He added that the worry of unethical AI usage was in the spreading of fake news especially – which uses deepfakes, impersonation of identities, fakery and manipulation of sensitive data.
 “The AIGE code of ethics is developed especially for the application and reference of three main groups – users, policymakers and those who offer the technology. 
 Gobind said that AI had the potential to generate US$113.4bil (RM477bil) to the country’s economy. 
 He pointed out that AIGE was another government effort to further strengthen existing legislation dealing with data usage and technology – such as the Cybersecurity Act 2024, Personal Data Protection Act 2010 and the proposed Omnibus Bill. 
 “AIGE will play an important role when the NAIO under MyDigital Corporation begins operating this November to build an ecosystem for AI in the country’s digital transformation.
 “The Digital Ministry will also form a Malaysian Data Commission to ensure effective data management and protection, in line with the trend of setting up data development centres and investments of companies such as AWS, Google, ByteDance, Nvidia, Microsoft and Vantage,” Gobind said.",putrajaya comment government code ethic artificial intelligence datuk seri fadillah deputy prime minister code ethic artificial intelligence governance ethic guideline parameter user regulatory measure responsible development adoption technology government national artificial intelligence office naio formation data commission fadillah aige yesterday science technology inno vation minister chang lih kang digital minister gobind singh deo aige transparency accountability level proof government commitment trust public technology decision system accurate data free bias corrode justice fairness guideline stress personal data protection user valuable commodity right privacy individual protected data system fadillah government wary social economic implication manpower increase unemployment educate generation potential education ethic technology education curriculum enable child technology literate responsible usage technology fadillah chang aige private sector step legislation space aige law guideline hope guideline law process time enact legislation reference industry player discipline current law curb scam reference abides guideline process child moral teach chang education ministry incorporate guideline school curriculum child ethic updated technological advancement speech chang market malaysia reach bil morgan gross domestic product economy worry unethical usage fake news deepfakes impersonation identity manipulation sensitive data ethic application reference main user policymakers technology gobind potential generate bil bil country economy aige government effort legislation data usage technology cybersecurity personal data protection omnibus bill aige play role mydigital corporation build ecosystem country digital transformation digital ministry form malaysian data commission effective data management protection trend data development investment company google bytedance nvidia microsoft vantage gobind,"[(0, 0.9962068)]",0
730998,Main,6,21/09/2024,Expert: Don’t confine AI code of ethics to govt entities,,"PUTRAJAYA: A code of ethics on the use and development of artificial intelligence (AI) should not just be confined to government entities but also expanded to the private sector, says an expert.
 The Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines (AIGE),  based on seven main principles, were launched here yesterday as a regulatory measure for responsible development and adoption of AI technology. 
 Dr Azree Nazri from Universiti Putra Malaysia’s Institute of Mathematical Research said the policy is pivotal in shaping the future of the country’s AI industry. 
 “With China’s overwhelming lead in generative AI patents and the complexities of effective regulation, Malaysia faces a challenging path. 
 “The AIGE offers a strong framework for responsible AI, but limiting it to government entities reduces its overall impact – as most AI development is led by private companies,” he said when contacted. 
 Azree – who is also Artificial Intelligence Society Malaysia president – said that without alignment from the private sector, AI practices could remain fragmented and undermine the goal of ethical governance.
 “Incentives can help bridge this gap. Benefits such as tax breaks, grants and recognition programmes encourage companies to voluntarily adopt AIGE standards. 
 “Through voluntary adoption, collaboration and government incentives, AIGE’s goals of fostering fair, transparent and accountable AI can be achieved across both public and private sectors,” he said. 
 However, he said Malaysia had yet to have any local AI infrastructure.
 “The AIGE is akin to establishing an airspace law but ‘without airports and airplanes’,” Nazree said. 
 He also said besides China, Malaysia needed to learn from the United States with regard to regulations governing the AI industry.
 “In the US, regulators are grappling with how to manage the risks associated with high-capability AI systems. One approach involves setting thresholds for AI models based on their computational power. 
 “The move aims at addressing potential dangers without stifling technological progress, a strategy that Malaysia may need to consider as it develops its own regulatory framework,” Azree said. 
 Meanwhile, Cybersecurity consultant Fong Choong Fook said the AIGE was the best set of regulations the government could come up with to govern AI.
 He said imposing ethics into law for AI would be very difficult for now due to the fluidity and variables of AI. 
 “With Malaysia just beginning to dabble in AI and with the future being bright for AI development and usage, this is a good time to set down such a code of ethics. 
 “This would enable the ethics to be ingrained from the start,” he said.
 The seven AIGE principles are fairness; reliability, safety and control; privacy and security; inclusiveness; transparency; accountability and the pursuit of human benefit and happiness. 
 Under the fairness principles, the development of AI must be designed to avoid bias or discrimination against the target users. 
 According to the second principle, AI systems should perform as intended with consent for usage of data the top priority. 
 The principle of privacy and security also encourages constant, consistent testing and certification as well as risk and impact assessments.
 All AI systems should not have one-size-fits-all approaches and should address the widest possible range of factors – such as age, gender, religion and ethnicity.
 Transparency is pertinent in contexts where AI is used as part of decision-making and AI algorithms should be transparent – be they technical processes or human decisions. 
 Besides accountability, the other principle caters to respecting human-centred values and enhancing quality of life while ensuring that AI systems do not undermine human autonomy through governance mechanisms.",putrajaya code ethic development artificial intelligence government entity private sector artificial intelligence governance ethic guideline main principle yesterday regulatory measure responsible development adoption technology azree nazri universiti putra malaysia institute mathematical policy pivotal shaping future country industry china lead generative patent complexity effective regulation malaysia path aige strong framework responsible limiting government entity impact development private company azree artificial intelligence society malaysia president alignment private sector practice fragmented undermine goal ethical governance incentive gap benefit tax break grant recognition programme company aige standard voluntary adoption collaboration government incentive goal fair transparent accountable public private sector local infrastructure aige akin airspace law airplane nazree china malaysia learn united regard regulation industry regulator manage risk capability system threshold model computational power move potential danger technological progress strategy malaysia regulatory framework azree cybersecurity consultant fong choong fook aige regulation government govern ethic law difficult fluidity variable malaysia dabble future development usage time code ethic enable ethic aige principle reliability safety control privacy security inclusiveness transparency accountability pursuit human benefit happiness fairness principle development avoid bias discrimination target user principle system consent usage data top priority principle privacy security constant consistent certification risk impact assessment system size approach widest range factor age gender religion ethnicity transparency pertinent context decision algorithm transparent technical process human decision accountability principle caters human value quality life system undermine human autonomy governance mechanism,"[(0, 0.44909784), (1, 0.39407927), (2, 0.15418784)]",0

730336,StarBiz,4,19/09/2024,Soft skills in an AI future,,"HOW ready and equipped are today’s young Filipinos for the jobs of the future? 
 We’re already in a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) promises to be all around us, running smart machines including transport vehicles; doing much of the work of doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals; and much more. 
 With so many types of jobs seemingly at risk from wide application of AI, will our “demographic sweet spot,” or abundant supply of workers (versus ageing populations in most other countries), be an asset, or will it be a burden in our future economy? 
 What skills will they need in order to find a productive role in the workplaces of the future?
 A new study from the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) authored by Allan Bernardo, Jose Ramon Albert, Jana Flor Vizmanos, and Mika Munoz warns that lack of “soft skills” makes Filipino youth ill-prepared for the challenges of AI and other emerging technologies characterising the Fourth Industrial Revolution that’s now upon us. 
 This will impact not only on their individual career prospects, but will also impair our economy’s stability, competitiveness, and innovation potential.
 What do we mean by soft skills? 
 These are personal attributes and interpersonal abilities that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with others. 
 Unlike hard skills, which are technical and job-specific, soft skills are more about how one works and interacts with workmates. 
 They are critical for success in the workplace and applicable across different jobs and industries. 
 Included in soft skills are communication (clearly expressing ideas and listening to others), teamwork (working well with others to achieve a common goal), problem-solving (identifying and resolving issues efficiently), adaptability (being flexible and open to change), emotional intelligence (managing one’s own emotions and understanding those of others), time management (prioritising tasks and managing time effectively), leadership (guiding, motivating, inspiring others), and conflict resolution (handling disputes constructively). 
 These are not taught as subjects in school; they are learned through experience, interactions, and relationships with others.
 Job-skills mismatch
 Years ago, I led a team analysing the job-skills mismatch in a project of the Philippine Business for Education, where we interviewed various industrial firms in different parts of the country, along with officials of colleges and universities accessible to them. 
 We were often told by hiring managers that their applicants’ training in the hard skills of science and engineering was usually not the decisive factor in their decision to hire or not to hire someone. 
 They reasoned that specific technical skills could be provided through on-the-job training after the worker is hired. 
 But it was their soft skills that usually swung their hiring decision, and the ability to communicate well and to collaborate in teams were among those most cited.
 Soft skills will be critically important for workers in the era of AI. 
 While workers will need the hard skills for navigating new tools and systems, soft skills will complement them by fostering adaptability and human-centered problem-solving, which machines can never replace. 
 Human creativity
 AI can do the data-driven tasks, but it is human creativity and ability to think outside the box that leads to breakthroughs.
 The PIDS paper argues that “addressing this (soft skills) gap requires a concerted effort from educational institutions, policymakers, and industry leaders to redefine skills development frameworks and prioritise the cultivation of these essential competencies.” 
 It must also be recognised that the solution to the soft skills gap in our country hinges not on tertiary education alone, be it in technical and vocational education and training (TVET), or in college degree programmes. 
 Soft skills are instilled long before students enter TVET or higher education institutions – if they do at all. 
 Basic education
 It goes back to basic education in the elementary and high school levels, where children subconsciously imbibe these soft skills not in their school subjects but through their learning experiences in school, at home, and in the community.
 In sum, it’s not just about what our young people learn. 
 Equally important is how they learn. 
 Since learning does not only happen in classrooms, this is a concern not just for teachers and principals, but also for parents and family members, and the community where the child grows. 
 “It takes a village to raise a child,” as the saying goes – and this is most true in honing the child’s crucial soft skills. 
 This is also why education must be contextualised in our young people’s particular community situations, and this bolsters the case for decentralised and devolved management of our education system. 
 A centralised and top-down approach simply won’t get it right. — The Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN

729728,Main,6,18/09/2024,"Use AI to ease traffic congestion, says Ahmad Maslan",,"JOHOR BARU: All 33 highway concessionaires in the country should utilise artificial intelligence (AI) to address traffic congestion, particularly during long weekends and public holidays, says Deputy Works Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan.
 He said the companies should take advantage of available technology instead of blaming the traffic snarl on the increasing number of vehicles.
 “One of the current solutions is the introduction of smart lanes where vehicles are allowed to use the emergency lane. I hope we can increase the number of smart lanes from the current 18 lanes we have nationwide.
 “Another solution is the use of the My Travel Time Advisory (My-TTA) by PLUS Malaysia Bhd, which helps travellers decide when to begin their journey to avoid traffic jams,” he said.
 However, he said that more sustainable methods should be tried out. 
 “We cannot solely rely on smart lanes, as their travel distance is short. And congestion will still occur during public holidays and long weekends,” he told reporters after the opening ceremony of the Highway Concession Conference  2024 yesterday. 
 Ahmad said that highway concessionaires could also introduce compulsory exits, particularly in cases of accidents or severe congestion.
 “Perhaps we could add more smart lanes or extend the operating hours of existing ones.
 “We may also consider introducing a contra-flow lane, where one lane on the less busy side of the road is closed to allow vehicles on the busier side to pass more easily,” he said.
 On another matter, Ahmad said the ministry was hoping to introduce a third phase of the expansion project on the North-South Expressway (NSE) from Simpang Renggam to Yong Peng Utara.
 The third phase, he said would cover about 41km, with an estimated development cost of RM1bil.
 Ahmad said he hoped that the Finance Ministry would announce a special allocation for the project during the tabling of Budget 2025 next month.
 “The first phase of the expansion has already begun, involving the widening of the road from four to six lanes between Senai Utara and Sedenak, costing RM525mil,” he added.
 As for the second phase which stretched from Sedenak to Simpang Renggam, he said it would cost RM505mil as announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last year.
 He said the third phase could be divided into two stages – from Simpang Renggam to Ayer Hitam next year, followed by Ayer Hitam to Yong Peng Utara the following year.
 “This way, we can split the RM1bil cost into RM500mil per year,” he added.",johor concessionaire country artificial intelligence address traffic congestion public holiday deputy minister datuk seri ahmad maslan company technology traffic snarl vehicle current solution introduction smart lane vehicle emergency lane smart lane current lane nationwide solution travel time advisory tta malaysia bhd traveller journey avoid traffic jam sustainable method smart lane distance short congestion public holiday weekend reporter highway concession conference yesterday highway concessionaire compulsory exit accident severe congestion smart lane operating hour contra flow lane lane busy road vehicle ahmad ministry introduce phase expansion project north south expressway nse simpang renggam peng utara phase cover development cost bil ahmad finance ministry special allocation project budget month phase expansion road lane utara sedenak mil phase sedenak simpang renggam cost mil prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim phase stage renggam ayer hitam ayer hitam peng utara split bil cost mil,"[(2, 0.993374)]",2
729966,StarBiz,8,18/09/2024,Intel to make custom AI chip for Amazon,Firm committed to US ops as German plant delayed,"SAN FRANCISCO: Intel Corp chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger (pic) has landed Amazon.com Inc’s AWS as a customer for the company’s manufacturing business, potentially bringing work to new plants under construction in the United States and boosting his efforts to turn around the embattled chipmaker. 
 Intel and AWS will co-invest in a custom semiconductor for artificial intelligence (AI) computing – what’s known as a fabric chip – in a “multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework,” according to a statement on Monday.
 The work will rely on Intel’s 18A process, an advanced chipmaking technology.
 The shares jumped almost 10% in late trading after the announcement. They had been down 58% this year, closing at US$20.91.
 “Today’s announcement is big,” Gelsinger said in an interview. “This is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities.”
 The news was part of a flurry of announcements that followed a pivotal board meeting last week. Intel also is postponing new factories in Germany and Poland, but remains committed to its US expansion in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio.
 Gelsinger, who embarked on a bold comeback effort for Intel in 2021, has had to scale back some of his ambitions in the name of efficiency. 
 With sales shrinking and losses piling up, the company announced plans last month to slash 15,000 workers, find US$10bil in cost savings and suspend Intel’s dividend. Now he’s going further to rein in expansion plans, especially overseas.
 The Poland and Germany construction projects will be paused for about two years depending on market demand. 
 Another one in Malaysia will be completed but only put into operation when conditions support it, Intel said.
 At last week’s three-day board meeting, executives presented options on how to conserve cash while keeping Gelsinger’s turnaround plan on track. 
 The CEO’s effort hinges on transforming Intel into a so-called foundry, a chipmaker that manufacturers products for outside customers. 
 The Santa Clara, California-based company has been slow to line up customers for the project – and a high-profile client such as Amazon represents a notable win.
 Intel also is looking to speed up efforts to execute the US$10bil in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing, an area where rival Nvidia Corp has excelled.
 AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, and it could help build confidence that Intel can compete with the likes of foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 
 AWS has used Intel processors over the years, but has been shifting more toward in-house designs – the very products that Intel may now help manufacture.
 Microsoft Corp, another major cloud-computing provider, announced plans in February to use Intel for some of its in-house chips as well.
 Another change: Intel’s foundry operations, referred to as IFS, will be further separated from the rest of the company and become a wholly owned subsidiary. 
 That move is aimed in part at convincing prospective customers – some of whom compete with Intel – that they are dealing with an independent supplier.
 “We still have things to learn about becoming a foundry,” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I need lots of customers.”
 In another win, Intel said earlier Monday that it’s eligible to receive as much as US$3bil in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military. 
 The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defence and intelligence purposes. 
 That news helped send the shares up 6.4% in regular trading Monday.
 Intel still has a long way to go to win back Wall Street’s confidence. 
 After years of losing ground to rivals and seeing its technological edge slip, the Silicon Valley pioneer is valued at less than US$90bil.
 It no longer ranks as one of the top 10 chipmakers on that basis. 
 Nvidia, meanwhile, now has a market capitalisation of about US$2.9 trillion.
 Intel shocked investors with a bleak financial report last month, triggering the biggest single-day stock decline in decades. Analysts described the announcement as Intel’s worst-ever earnings report.  — Bloomberg",san francisco intel corp chief executive officer pat gelsinger pic amazon aws customer company manufacturing business plant construction effort chipmaker intel invest custom semiconductor artificial intelligence fabric chip multi multi dollar framework statement monday intel process technology share late trading announcement announcement gelsinger interview customer design capability news flurry announcement pivotal board meeting week intel factory germany poland committed expansion mexico oregon ohio gelsinger bold comeback effort intel scale ambition efficiency sale loss company plan month worker cost saving intel dividend rein expansion plan overseas germany construction project market demand malaysia operation condition intel week day board executive option cash gelsinger turnaround plan ceo effort hinge intel foundry chipmaker manufacturer product customer clara california company slow customer profile client amazon notable win intel speed effort bil cost saving focus product rival nvidia corp largest provider cloud build confidence intel compete foundry leader taiwan semiconductor manufacturing aws intel processor house design product intel manufacture microsoft corp major cloud provider plan february intel house chip intel foundry operation rest company subsidiary move prospective customer independent supplier learn foundry gelsinger interview customer intel monday eligible receive bil government funding manufacture chip military effort secure enclave steady supply edge chip defence intelligence purpose news share regular trading monday intel wall street confidence ground rival technological edge slip silicon valley pioneer bil rank top chipmakers basis market capitalisation intel investor bleak financial report month biggest single day stock decline decade analyst announcement intel worst earnings report bloomberg,"[(0, 0.15926425), (4, 0.83761704)]",4
729988,StarBiz,9,18/09/2024,Hong Kong considering  rules for AI use in finance,Affluent hub seeks to signal support for emerging tech,"Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government is preparing to issue its maiden policy statement on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could catalyse the use of the technology in areas from trading to investment banking and cryptocurrencies.
 The city’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau plans to issue a framework of guidelines to touch on the ethical use of AI and general principles for applying the technology in the finance world, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. 
 Officials are still drafting the document while getting feedback from the industry, the people said. 
 Details are still subject to change in the coming weeks, they added.
 While specifics remain unclear, the document is broadly intended to signal Hong Kong’s support for AI, as governments around the world come to grips with the technology’s potential. 
 Local regulators are also trying to resolve some of the confusion around AI in Hong Kong, a city that’s caught up in the US-Chinese technology conflict. 
 Many consumers and corporations can’t easily access some of the hottest services from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Google’s Gemini, because US tech leaders are likely nervous about running afoul of the Chinese territory’s rules, analysts said.
 Officials expect to unveil their statement around late October during Fintech Week, one of the industry’s most important annual gatherings. 
 “The government and the financial regulators are closely monitoring market developments and global experiences in order to promote the responsible use of AI in the financial industry,” a spokesman for the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said in a statement. 
 “The government will issue a policy statement later this year, setting out its policy stance and approach on the application of AI in the financial market,” the spokesman added.
 Hong Kong wants to re-position the affluent city as a financial centre, as foreign investors grow nervous about Beijing’s growing control and consider alternative locations such as Singapore. 
 The South-East Asian nation has forged ahead in crafting guidance on everything from crypto to fintech and AI.
 At the same time, Wall Street is exploring ways AI might reshape financial firms’ operations. 
 Banks globally have been advertising to lure AI talent and are using emerging technologies for tasks such as examining client portfolios and looking for potential defaulters.
 A policy statement would provide broad direction and wouldn’t be immediately enforceable. 
 Still, such statements have become a popular way for the Hong Kong administration to declare its commitment to new and competitive policy areas such as Web3 and family offices. 
 The anticipated statement suggests regulators will adopt a favourable attitude toward AI applications and will later release more concrete rules, the people said. 
 The policy statement is intended also to consolidate various detailed guidance from individual banking and securities regulators, according to the people.  — Bloomberg",hong kong government issue maiden policy statement artificial intelligence finance people familiar matter move catalyse technology trading investment banking cryptocurrencies city financial service treasury bureau plan framework guideline ethical principle technology finance people private official document feedback industry people detail subject week specific unclear document signal hong kong support government grip technology potential local regulator confusion hong kong city chinese technology conflict consumer corporation access hottest service chatgpt google gemini tech leader nervous afoul chinese territory rule analyst official unveil statement late october fintech week industry annual gathering government financial regulator market development global experience responsible financial industry spokesman financial service treasury bureau statement government issue policy statement policy stance approach application financial market spokesman kong position affluent city financial centre foreign investor nervous control alternative location south east asian nation guidance crypto fintech time wall street reshape financial firm operation bank lure talent technology task client portfolio potential defaulter policy statement broad direction enforceable statement popular kong administration declare commitment competitive policy family office statement regulator favourable attitude application concrete rule people policy statement consolidate guidance individual banking security regulator people,"[(2, 0.2695798), (5, 0.7264988)]",5

729414,StarBiz,13,17/09/2024,Chip startup Groq backs Saudi AI ambitions,,"Riyadh: Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Groq Inc has partnered with oil producer Aramco to build a giant data centre in Saudi Arabia that it hopes will become a hub for companies running AI systems across the Middle East, Africa and India.
 The California-based startup will operate what it has said will be the world’s largest AI inferencing centre that initially has 19,000 language processing units (LPUs), while Aramco will fund the development that is expected to cost “in the order of nine figures”, Groq chief executive officer Jonathan Ross said in an interview in Riyadh. The data centre will be up and running by the end of this year, and could later expand to include a total of 200,000 language processing units, Ross said
 Groq has partnered with Aramco Digital, a new unit of the world’s largest oil producer intended to help Aramco harness AI to help its core energy business while also facilitating other firms to use AI. 
 Aramco is “planning to do massive capital deployments for this, and it is a way to help diversify the economy away from oil,” Ross said. 
 By building the data centre in Saudi Arabia, Groq aims to capitalise on the country’s low energy costs, availability of land, and access to four billion people within a 100 millisecond ping – a measure of how quickly data can travel between processing location and users.
 Saudi Arabia wants to become a hub for technology industries like AI as it seeks ways to modernise its economy and boost other sources of income besides oil. 
 Yet some of its growth plans have been hampered by US government restrictions on exports of the latest AI chips, which has limited the availability of the latest chips developed by Nvidia Corp.
 Groq said it does not expect to face any US government restrictions on its plans to boost its presence in Saudi Arabia, including establishing a regional headquarters in Riyadh.
 “We’ve been very open with US Commerce Department about our intent to deploy here,” Ross said. 
 Groq could look at working with the Saudi oil producer on other projects in the future, Ross said. 
 “The expectation is that we’re going to partner with Aramco Digitial for quite a bit of our deployment in this region and anywhere we can,” he said. 
 “They’ve been a great partner so we would work with them anywhere we could.” 
 The inferencing data centre will use Groq’s LPU AI inference technology, advanced AI processors designed specifically for massive-scale inference workloads that deliver speed and efficiency. 
 In the past six months alone, nearly half a million AI developers have adopted Groq inference cloud solutions. 
 The partnership in Saudi Arabia is expected to set the new compute standard for AI inference data centres around the world, and marks progress towards the Groq mission to develop AI inference compute centers around the globe.
 The partnership aims to revolutionise data processing and analytics across various sectors. 
 The facility will process billions of tokens per day by the end of 2024 and be able to onboard hundreds of thousands of developers in the region and then hundreds of billions of tokens per day with millions of developers by 2025. 
 Tareq Amin, chief excutive of Aramco Digital, said, “With the support of the kingdom’s leadership, we are proud to partner with Groq to develop a world-leading inferencing data center in Saudi Arabia.

729306,Lifestyle,6,16/09/2024,AI invokes awe and anxiety,Wonder and trepidation as AI transforms smartphones with powerful yet potentially troubling features.,"MATTHEW Day was keen to find out if an artificial intelligence-packed Google Pixel 9 smartphone could tell him a great local fishing spot.
 California Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin of the United States whipped up a playful picture of her dog in front of the state capitol building.
 Igor Gaspar launched into a discussion with the Pixel regarding causes of inflation.
 Fascination tinged with concern was a common reaction as people in Santa Cruz dabbled with a Pixel 9 and its capabilities, including the ability to “add” oneself to pictures and having a whip-smart digital assistant at one’s command.
 Passersby in the coastal California city were asked to test out the phone’s features as Google and Apple increasingly integrate AI into their products, marking what they describe as a transformative time for devices central to modern life.
 “I asked it a question, and it gave me a quick answer,” Day said as he checked out the Pixel 9.
 “That’s a lot better than the phone I have right now, I’ll tell you that much.”
 “(There are) definitely some incredible tools that people would have available to them to do creative things and gather information,” Pellerin said after putting a Pixel through its paces.
 Yet worries also mounted.
 “But I’m also concerned about nefarious uses of it, and we need to have those guardrails and regulations so it doesn’t cause havoc in any industries or communities or whatever,” she added.
 Pellerin is backing state legislation aimed at thwarting AI being used for misinformation and deepfakes.
 Along with her concerns was admiration, though, for the benefits of AI features such as an “Add Me” tool that lets people take a photo of family or friends, then add themselves in as though they were part of the group from the outset.
 “I could see myself, as these tools become available, utilising them more and more,” she said of AI on smartphones.“It’s scary. It’s going to only increase the desperation that comes if we have to live without them.”
 Bells and whistles?
 University of California, Santa Cruz, computer science professor Leilani Gilpin questioned the need to put AI in people’s pockets and wondered whether confident- sounding smartphone replies will mask moments when the software is “hallucinating” – making up inaccurate information.
 “Different language models hallucinate different information,” Gilpin said.
 “So, the same thing is going to happen for people using this,” she added, hefting the smartphone.
 “Whether it’s for trivia or for generating images or other things, there’ll be some made-up information, and that’s just a way that the models work.”
 Gilpin liked the idea of engaging with AI conversationally while out walking, but felt spoken exchanges lacked a sense of talking with a real person.
 “I work on a lot of these technologies, so I feel like it’s a couple of bells and whistles on things I’ve seen before,” Gilpin said.
 “I don’t think it’s going to be super revolutionary.”
 Gilpin and others also found the smartphone AI to be verbose, diving deeply into topics when short replies would suffice.
 Meanwhile, Gaspar and some friends created a group photo using the Pixel “Add Me” feature, with that capability alone prompting one of them to offer to swap phones.
 “It was a really impressive feature,” 23-year-old Gaspar said.
 “But, with the information war we have, I think a lot of people could be kind of scared by the futuristic aspect of things – like you can add me to a picture in a way that’s real.”
 Seeing powerful AI tools on new smartphones “raises eyebrows” for Gaspar, who said having them packed into iPhones could spoil his taste for Apple products unless he feels in complete control of the technology.
 “I wouldn’t feel comfortable with having something that’s so advanced that we aren’t even sure of how it works on our phones,” Gaspar said.
 “I do love Apple products, but if there’s going to be this shift towards artificial intelligence without a choice of the consumer, I would step away from that.”
 In some ways, companies are already trying to avoid negative fallout from infusing AI into their products.
 Google appeared to be taking steps to avoid controversy, with its Gemini AI-powered digital assistant on the Pixel declining to talk about elections or politics and the image generation tool telling users it would not depict real people. – AFP",matthew day artificial intelligence google pixel smartphone local fishing spot california assemblywoman gail pellerin whipped playful picture dog front capitol building igor gaspar discussion pixel inflation fascination concern common reaction people cruz pixel capability ability picture smart digital assistant command passersby coastal california city test phone feature apple integrate product transformative time device central modern life question quick answer day pixel lot phone incredible tool people pellerin pixel pace worry concerned nefarious guardrail regulation industry community legislation misinformation deepfakes concern admiration benefit feature tool people family friend outset tool smartphones scary increase desperation live bell university california santa cruz computer science professor leilani gilpin people pocket confident smartphone reply moment software inaccurate language model gilpin happen people smartphone trivia image model idea exchange sense real person lot technology couple bell gilpin super revolutionary gilpin smartphone verbose deeply topic short reply gaspar friend photo pixel feature capability offer swap phone impressive feature gaspar war lot people futuristic aspect picture real powerful tool raise gaspar iphones spoil taste apple product feel complete control technology feel comfortable advanced phone apple product artificial intelligence choice consumer step company negative fallout product google step avoid controversy gemini digital assistant pixel talk election politics image generation tool user depict real people,"[(2, 0.9956761)]",2
729012,Lifestyle,21,15/09/2024,Turning the tide with AI,"Armed with AI-driven forecasts and cash assistance, Nigerian farmers take steps to safeguard their farms before floods strike.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) and traditional aid are helping farmers like Salihu Ali in northern Nigeria act before their farms are submerged by increasingly regular floods fuelled by climate change.
 Ali was warned that floods were coming in 2022 and was provided with cash to prepare his farm in Dasin Hausa, a remote village of cowpea, maize, and rice farmers in Adamawa state.
 In response, he harvested his maize early and moved the barn where he kept seedlings and fertiliser uphill.
 “We (farmers) contributed money to buy canoes to transport our crops, seedlings, fertilisers and other farm inputs when the water became too high,” Ali said.
 He was among 1,450 families who were given US$450 (RM1,950) in the pilot project, which relied on AI to develop flood forecasting models based on large amounts of data, ranging from satellite information to historical events to river levels.
 The project, run by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a non-governmental humanitarian organisation, in partnership with Google.org, the tech giant’s philanthropic arm, has now been renewed and expanded with a cash injection of US$4.6mil (RM19.9mil) from Google to IRC and the non-profit GiveDirectly.
 The idea is simple: harness AI to predict floods before they happen and give communities cash before the waters rise so they can prepare their farms and limit the damage to their homes.
 Forecasts from Google’s AI tool Flood Hub and data from national authorities will be used to strengthen early warning systems and trigger payouts to 7,500 people in flood-prone areas in the northern Adamawa and Kogi states.
 Google’s Flood Hub uses open-source data, including weather forecasts and satellite imagery, to predict floods up to seven days in advance.
 Food security
 Warming temperatures due to climate change are increasing the intensity and frequency of Africa’s rains, according to United Nations climate experts.
 Extreme weather events are undermining food security in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. But early warning systems can help reduce fatalities and mitigate the risk of widespread hunger caused by regular floods.
 The floods in 2022 destroyed 770,000 hectares of farmland and submerged thousands of homes across several Nigerian states. More than 600 people were killed, and at least two million people had to flee their homes.
 But the damage could have been worse.
 A few weeks before the rains came, researchers from IRC’s Airbel Impact Lab prepared flood forecasts using hydrological and meteorological data gathered from its flood monitoring system and Nigeria’s meteorological agency.
 Clare Clingain, research coordinator at the Airbel Impact Lab, said they shared the information with local authorities and IRC workers in Nigeria, who organised meetings and distributed flyers to warn residents.
 “When designing anticipatory action, everything is based on a forecast, and you want to make sure that forecast is reliable and accurate,” Clingain said.
 Redefining aid response
 In Adamawa, more than half of the farmers who received cash said they used the money to harvest crops early, elevate storage barns from flood paths and stockpile food, according to the IRC’s evaluation report.
 The forecasts drew on data from the European Union’s Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), an AI model that uses satellite flood detection algorithms, in addition to information from Nigeria’s meteorological and emergency agencies.
 The IRC says it will now use forecasts from Google’s Flood Hub and a combination of other tools to get accurate predictions.
 Clingain said accuracy was key to persuading farmers to act. In the past, forecasts have been unreliable, or warnings sometimes came too late for farmers, or aid agencies to act.
 Alex Diaz, head of AI for social good at Google.org, said timing was also critical.
 “If you get an early warning a day before, that might save your life, but if you get it five days to a week in advance, that can save your livelihood when you have the cash to help you do that,” he said.
 GiveDirectly, which makes cash transfers to the phones of people living in poverty, has also tested the approach in Mozambique.AI tools can help bridge gaps in gathering weather-related data, while early forecasts help aid agencies redefine their disaster responses, said Vera Lummis, a senior manager of digital innovation at GiveDirectly.
 “The traditional way of delivering disaster aid is that it’s done after a disaster, but unfortunately, in a lot of cases, cash assistance or aid many times doesn’t reach families affected (until) months after a disaster,” she said.

727944,Main,5,12/09/2024,"Be careful with AI in elections, say political parties",,"PETALING JAYA: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) looks set to play a major role in the US election campaign, several politicians here are advising caution about its use in the 16th General Election (GE16), especially with its potential to spread disinformation and deepfakes.
 With AI now capable of creating realistic text-to-speech and voice-emulation deepfakes, the stakes are very high, said Barisan Nasional secretary-general Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
 “We are worried about AI-driven political networks which are used to spread fantasy, fiction and mass delusion.
 “Barisan suffered heavily in (the) 2018 (elections) due to fake news. Our attempts to address this with the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 about a month before the elections failed to convince voters of the threats posed by fake news.
 “Consequently, the Pakatan Harapan government also faced similar issues.
 “In the next elections, new tools like AI will be used, but we must not be driven by free-for-all campaigning without values and morals,” he told The Star.
 In July last year, an influencer was investigated after an AI-generated clip emerged depicting Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow allegedly announcing a new policy to enable single men to find women.
 In December last year, a video purportedly depicting former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob delivering a national address in fluent Tagalog, also made its rounds on social media. 
 On Aug 29, Terengganu PAS Youth lodged a police report over an AI-generated image mocking the state government over its stance on female athletes’ attire. 
 The image showed a person wearing a black burqa while diving into a swimming pool, captioned “Welcome to Afganu!”. 
 PKR communications director Lee Chean Chung said there was a need for a code of ethics when using AI and greater accountability by social media platforms.
 He said he would advocate for the labelling of AI-generated content in GE16 to improve transparency.
 “People are already vulnerable to human-driven scams and crimes,” he said, adding that better tools and more robust cybersecurity measures are needed to detect AI abuse.
 PAS central working committee member Khairil Nizam Khirudin said the party was open to technological developments but stressed the importance of truth in social media use.
 “If AI has more downsides, especially in spreading fake news and slander, then PAS will reject it. We have seen AI-generated fake content targeting the Terengganu government recently,” he said.
 He urged the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to act swiftly, adding that the regulator must be fair in such cases.
 On whether PAS will use AI in its GE16 campaigns, Khairil Nizam said that it would depend on election rules.
 “If permitted, Perikatan Nasional will use AI technology based on truth, not slander,” he said.
 Muda information chief Leben Siddharth acknowledged AI’s growing role in electoral processes, with applications ranging from targeted campaigning to voter engagement and management.
 “Muda is open to utilising AI tools responsibly to enhance our political campaigns and outreach efforts.
 “However, Muda is concerned about the potential for AI to spread misinformation. The rise of generative AI has made it easier to create convincing deepfakes and misleading content,” Leben said, adding that the Election Commission should introduce regulations to oversee AI use in elections.",jaya artificial intelligence play major role election campaign politician caution election potential spread disinformation deepfakes capable realistic text speech voice emulation deepfakes stake barisan nasional secretary datuk seri zambry abd kadir political network fantasy fiction mass delusion barisan election news attempt anti fake news month election convince voter threat fake news pakatan harapan government issue election tool free value moral star july influencer clip penang chief minister chow kon announcing policy enable single woman video prime minister datuk seri ismail sabri yaakob national address fluent tagalog social medium terengganu pa youth police report image government stance female athlete image person black burqa pool afganu pkr communication director lee chean chung code ethic accountability social medium platform content transparency people vulnerable human scam crime tool robust cybersecurity measure abuse pa central committee khairil khirudin party technological development social medium downside fake news slander pa reject fake content terengganu government malaysian communication commission regulator fair pa campaign nizam depend election rule perikatan nasional technology truth slander muda chief leben siddharth role electoral process application voter engagement management muda tool political campaign effort muda potential spread misinformation rise generative easier create convincing deepfakes content leben election commission regulation election,"[(1, 0.65927917), (2, 0.33690137)]",1
728116,StarBiz,4,12/09/2024,Will AI hit employment and increase inequality?,,"THE release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has raised great hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to solving problems in many fields and lift productivity, but also fears that many jobs may disappear, and that income inequality could rise further.
 AI is commonly seen as a general-purpose technology, like the internal combustion engine, early electricity-based technologies, and computers. 
 Such technologies have the potential to disrupt large parts of the economy, displacing many workers. 
 Every wave of innovation in history has generated fears of “technological unemployment” but so far economies have generally succeeded in creating more jobs than those that were destroyed, even though transition phases have often been painful.
 Automation generally leads to productivity gains, which generate income that can be spent on new products and services, which in turn creates demand for labour. 
 Employment in difficult to automate activities rises with aggregate demand and new occupations are being created. 
 David Autor, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and co-authors find that about 60% of 2018 US jobs did not exist in 1940. 
 Reallocation of labour associated with technological change challenges workers, who often need reskilling and upskilling.
 Structural change may also be associated with macroeconomic and financial instability if economies struggle to adapt. 
 The income distribution is affected, as illustrated by the polarisation of labour markets in many advanced economies over the past decades.
 Will labour market developments in the AI era follow historical patterns, or will AI be a game changer?
 Like many digital tools before it, AI offers large potential for deployment across a wide range of economic activities. 
 Until recently, mainly routine tasks could be automated. 
 AI offers possibilities to automate non-routine cognitive tasks, thanks to its ability to learn by itself from huge datasets and integrate tacit knowledge. 
 Some researchers believe that machines could ultimately outperform humans in almost all activities. Nevertheless, even if one believes such prophecies, they are probably far away in the future. 
 At the current juncture, AI can automate some cognitive tasks and complement humans in performing more complex ones.
 Several studies have investigated different occupations’ exposure to AI, by linking some AI applications to skills used in specific professions. 
 This is a good starting point for thinking about the potential impact of AI on jobs, productivity, and inequality. 
 Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) Global Forum on Productivity suggests that jobs in knowledge-intensive services, such as finance, advertising, consulting, and information and communication are the most likely to be affected by AI. 
 Conversely, workers in industries like mining and construction, or relatively low knowledge-intensity services, such as administration and support, transportation, and water and waste, have limited exposure to AI. This has prompted fears that technological development, after automating routine tasks, which affected mainly blue-collar workers, would go on to automate even knowledge-intensive tasks, threatening the jobs of high-skilled workers.
 Crucial question
 A crucial question is whether AI can mainly automate tasks or whether it also has potential to augment workers’ abilities to perform their jobs. 
 In other words, whether AI is mostly a substitute or a complement to human labour. 
 According to a World Economic Forum report, both aspects are important, and their strength varies across economic sectors. Tasks are considered automatable if they do not require creatively solving ambiguous problems, working with others in real time or validating outputs. 
 The potential for augmentation of worker capabilities is particularly high in knowledge-intensity services. 
 For example, in information and technology services, nearly 32% of the time spent on all tasks could be subject to automation, but the potential for augmentation is even higher, reaching almost 37% of the time spent on all tasks. 
 In media and publishing, the potential for augmentation dominates that of automation even more, at 32% versus 24% of the time spent on all tasks.
 Hence, while AI is likely to displace some workers, it will also boost the productivity of others. 
 Medical diagnosis
 To give more concrete examples, while AI can improve medical diagnosis and help build legal cases, it is unlikely to replace physicians and lawyers anytime soon. 
 AI provides skilled professionals with new valuable tools, but in many circumstances, human intervention is still necessary, especially in high-stakes decisions, not least because AI is sometimes subject to hallucinations, producing inaccurate or misleading results.
 Recent studies point to significant improvements in workers’ performance due to AI in some specific tasks, ranging from 14% in customer services to 56%  in coding. 
 This suggests that if AI were to be widely adopted across the economy, productivity may rise substantially. 
 But translating micro-level performance into economy-wide productivity is challenging. 
 Productivity boost
 Estimates of AI’s potential labour productivity boost over the next decade in advanced economies generally vary from about 0.1 to more than 2.5 percentage points per year. 
 To put these numbers into perspective, US non-farm labour productivity grew at an average annual rate of 2.1% between 1947 and 2023, and 1.5% since 2006. 
 Hence, according to the most optimistic estimates, AI would lift productivity growth well-above historical trends. 
 Median estimates would bring labour productivity growth close the 3% observed between 1996 and 2005, during the deployment of the Internet. 
 However, other studies suggest this may be too optimistic. 
 AI-related productivity gains are likely to vary across countries.

727298,Main,16,10/09/2024,Summit to set AI military ‘blueprint’,International meeting aims to set rules and principles for responsible use,"THE republic convened an international summit seeking to establish a blueprint for the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the military, though any agreement is not expected to have binding powers to enforce it.More than 90 countries, inclu­ding the United States and China, have sent government represen­tatives to the two-day summit in Seoul, which is the second such gathering.
 At the first summit held in Amsterdam last year, the United States, China and other nations endorsed a modest “call to action” without legal commitment.
 “Recently, in the Russia-Ukraine war, an AI-applied Ukrainian drone functioned as David’s slingshot,” South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun said in an opening address yesterday.
 He was referring to Ukraine’s efforts for a technological edge against Russia by rolling out AI-enabled drones, hoping they will help overcome signal jamming as well as enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to work in larger groups.
 “As AI is applied to the military domain, the military’s operational capabilities are dramatically imp­ro­ved. However, it is like a double-edged sword, as it can cause damage from abuse,” Kim said.
 South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said discussions would cover areas such as a legal review to ensure compliance with international law and mechanisms to prevent autonomous weapons from making life-and-death decisions without appropriate human oversight.
 The Seoul summit hoped to agree to a blueprint for action, establishing a minimum level of guard-rails for AI in the military and suggesting principles on responsible use by reflecting principles laid out by Nato, the US or a number of other countries, accor­ding to a senior South Korean official.
 It was unclear how many nations attending the summit would endorse the document today, which is aiming to be a more detailed attempt to set boundaries on AI use in the military, but still likely lack legal commitments.
 The summit is not the only international set of discussions on AI use in the military.
 UN countries that belong to the 1983 Convention on Certain Con­ven­tional Weapons (CCW) are discussing potential restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons systems for compliance with international humanitarian law.
 The US government last year also launched a declaration on responsible use of AI in the military, which covers broader military application of AI, beyond weapons.
 As of August, 55 countries  have endorsed the declaration.  — Reuters",republic international summit blueprint responsible artificial intelligence military agreement power enforce country united china government represen tatives day summit seoul summit united china nation modest call action legal commitment russia ukraine war ukrainian drone david slingshot south korean defence minister kim hyun address yesterday ukraine effort technological edge russia drone overcome signal jamming enable unmanned aerial vehicle larger military domain military operational capability sword damage abuse kim south korean foreign minister cho tae yul discussion legal review compliance international law autonomous weapon life death decision human oversight seoul summit agree blueprint action minimum level guard military suggesting principle responsible principle nato country senior south korean official unclear nation summit document detailed attempt boundary military lack legal commitment international set discussion military country convention con ven tional weapon potential restriction autonomous weapon system compliance international humanitarian law government declaration responsible military cover military application weapon august country declaration reuters,"[(4, 0.9937195)]",4
726728,Main,24,08/09/2024,China is closing the AI gap with the United States,,"AT the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai in July, startup founder Qu Dongqi showed off a video he had recently posted online. It displayed an old photograph of a woman with two toddlers. Then the photo sprang to life as the woman lifted the toddlers up in her arms and they laughed with surprise.
 The video was created by AI technology from Chinese internet company Kuaishou. The technology was reminiscent of a video generator, called Sora, that American startup OpenAI unveiled this year. But unlike Sora, it was available to the general public.
 “My American friends still can’t use Sora,” Qu said. “But we already have better solutions here.”
 While the United States has had a head start on AI development, China is catching up. In recent weeks, several Chinese companies have unveiled AI technologies that rival leading American systems. And these technologies are already in the hands of consumers, businesses and independent software developers across the globe.
 While many American companies are worried that AI technologies could accelerate the spread of disinformation or cause other serious harm, Chinese companies are more willing to release their technologies to consumers or even share the underlying software code with other businesses and software developers. This kind of sharing of computer code, called open source, allows others to more quickly build and distribute their own products using the same technologies.
 Open source has been a cornerstone of the development of computer software, the internet and, now, artificial intelligence. The idea is that technology advances faster when its computer code is freely available for anyone to examine, use and improve upon.
 China’s efforts could have enormous implications as AI technology continues to develop in the years to come. The technology could increase the productivity of workers, fuel future innovations and power a new wave of military technologies, including autonomous weapons.
 When OpenAI kicked off the AI boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT, China struggled to compete with technologies emerging from American companies such as OpenAI and Google. But China’s progress is now accelerating.
 Kuaishou released its video generator, Kling, in China in June and to users worldwide on July 29. 
 Just before Kling’s arrival, 01.AI, a startup co-founded by Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and technologist who helped build Chinese offices for both Google and Microsoft, released chatbot technology that scored nearly as well as the leading American technologies on common benchmark tests that rate the performance of the world’s chatbots.
 New technology from Chinese tech giant Alibaba has also leaped to the top of a leaderboard that rates open-source AI systems. “We have disproved the commonplace belief that China doesn’t have the talent or the technology to compete with the US,” Lee said. “That belief is simply wrong.”
 In interviews, a dozen technologists and researchers at Chinese tech companies said open-source technologies were a key reason that China’s AI development has advanced so quickly. They saw open-source AI as an opportunity for the country to take a lead.
 But that will not be easy. The US remains at the forefront of AI research. And US officials have resolved to keep it that way.
 The White House has instituted a trade embargo designed to prevent Chinese companies from using the most powerful versions of computer chips that are essential to building artificial intelligence. A group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would make it easier for the White House to control the export of AI software built in the US.  Others are trying to limit the progress of open-source technologies that have helped fuel the rise of similar systems in China.
 The top American companies are also exploring new technologies that aim to eclipse the powers of today’s chatbots and video generators.
 “Chinese companies are good at replicating and improving what the US already has,” said Yiran Chen, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University in North Carolina. “They are not as good at inventing something completely new that will bypass the US in five to 10 years.”
 But many in China’s tech industry believe that open-source technology could help them grow despite those constraints. And if US regulators stifle the progress of American open-source projects (as some lawmakers are discussing) China could gain a significant edge. If the best open-source technologies come from China, US developers could end up building their systems atop Chinese technologies.
 “Open-source AI is the foundation of AI development,” said Clément Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a company that houses many of the world’s open-source AI projects. The US built its leadership in AI through collaboration between companies and researchers, he said, “and it looks like China could do the same thing.”
 AI systems require enormous resources: talent, data and computing power. Beijing has made it clear that the benefits accruing from such investments should be shared. The Chinese government has poured money into AI projects and subsidised resources like computing centers.
 But Chinese tech companies face a major constraint on the development of their AI systems: compliance with Beijing’s strict censorship regime, which extends to generative AI technologies.
 Kuaishou’s new video generator Kling appears to have been trained to follow the rules. Text prompts with any mention of China’s president, Xi Jinping, or controversial topics such as feminism and the country’s real estate crisis yielded error messages. An image prompt of this year’s National People’s Congress yielded a video of the delegates shifting in their seats.
 Kuaishou did not respond to questions about what steps the company took to prevent Kling from creating harmful, fake or politically sensitive content.
 By making their most advanced AI technologies freely available, China’s tech giants are demonstrating their willingness to contribute to the country’s overall technological advancement as Beijing has established that the power and profit of the tech industry should be channeled toward the goal of self sufficiency.
 The concern for some in China is that the country will struggle to amass the computing chips it needs to build increasingly powerful technologies. But that has not yet prevented Chinese companies from building powerful new technologies that can compete with US systems. — ©2024 The New York Times Company",artificial intelligence conference shanghai july startup founder dongqi video online photograph woman toddler sprang life woman toddler arm surprise video technology chinese internet company kuaishou technology reminiscent video generator sora american startup openai sora public american friend sora solution united head start development china week chinese company technology leading american system technology consumer business independent software developer american company technology spread disinformation harm chinese company release consumer share software code business software developer computer code source build distribute product technology source cornerstone development computer software internet artificial intelligence idea technology advance computer code examine china effort enormous implication technology technology increase productivity worker future innovation power military technology autonomous weapon boom late release online chatbot chatgpt china compete technology american company google china progress kuaishou video generator china june user arrival startup kai lee investor technologist chinese office microsoft chatbot technology leading american technology common benchmark test rate performance chatbots technology chinese tech giant alibaba top leaderboard rate source system commonplace belief china talent technology compete lee belief wrong interview dozen technologist researcher chinese tech company source technology key reason china development source opportunity country easy remains forefront official white house trade embargo chinese company powerful version computer chip essential artificial intelligence lawmaker bill white house control export software limit progress source technology rise system top american company technology eclipse power video generator chinese company yiran chen professor electrical computer engineering duke university north carolina inventing bypass china tech industry source technology grow constraint regulator progress american source project lawmaker china gain edge source technology developer system chinese technology source foundation development ment delangue ceo company house source project leadership collaboration company researcher system enormous resource talent data power benefit investment chinese government money project resource center chinese tech company major constraint development system compliance strict censorship regime generative technology video generator follow rule prompt mention china president jinping controversial topic country real estate crisis error message image prompt national people congress video seat respond question step company harmful fake sensitive content technology tech giant willingness contribute country technological advancement power profit tech industry goal sufficiency concern china country struggle amass chip powerful technology chinese company powerful technology system york time company,"[(2, 0.7003075), (6, 0.29767108)]",2
726730,Main,24,08/09/2024,Will AI kill meaningless jobs?,"The real question, however, is would  it be so bad.","WHEN Brad Wang started his first job in the tech industry, right after college, he marvelled at the way Silicon Valley had turned the drudgery of the workplace into a sumptuousness of game rooms, nap pods and leafy hiking trails. This is what it must have felt like to be a guest showing up for a party at Jay Gatsby’s house, Wang thought.
 But under the glitz was a kind of hollowness. He hopped from one software engineering role to another, toiling on some projects that he felt were meaningless. At Google, he worked for 15 months on an initiative that higher-ups decided to keep pursuing even though they knew it would never launch. He then spent more than a year at Facebook on a product whose primary customer at one point described it to the engineers as unhelpful.
 Over time, the pointlessness of his work began to incense Wang: “It’s like baking a pie that’s going right into the trash can.”
 The corporate office and its paperwork have a way of turning even ostensibly good jobs – the kind that provide decent salaries and benefits and take place behind ergonomic keyboards in climate-controlled comfort – into soul-sucking drudgery.
 In 2013, the now-deceased radical anthropologist David Graeber gave the world a distinct way to think about this problem in an essay called On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs. This anti-capitalist polemic by the man who had helped coin Occupy Wall Street’s iconic “99%” slogan went viral, seemingly speaking to a widely felt 21st century frustration. Graeber developed it into a book that delved deeper on the subject.
 He suggested that economist John Maynard Keynes’ dream of a 15-hour workweek had never come to pass because humans have invented millions of jobs so useless that even the people doing them can’t justify their existence. A quarter of the workforce in rich countries sees their jobs as potentially pointless, according to a study by Dutch economists Robert Dur and Max van Lent. If workers find the labour dispiriting, and the work adds nothing to society, what’s the argument for keeping these jobs?
 The stakes of that question have heightened as artificial intelligence hurtles forward, bringing with it the spectre of job displacement. A recent estimate by Goldman Sachs found that generative AI could eventually automate activities that amount to the equivalent of some 300 million full-time jobs globally – many of these in office roles like administrators and middle managers.
 When imagining a future where technology replaces human effort, we tend to think in two extremes: as a productivity boon for businesses and a disaster for the humans who will become obsolete.
 There is a possibility that lies somewhere between these scenarios, however, in which AI kills off some jobs that workers themselves deem meaningless, and even find psychologically degrading. If it did, would these workers be better off?
 Flunkies, Goons  and Box Tickers 
 The way researchers talk about AI can sometimes sound like a human resources manager evaluating the bushy-tailed summer intern: shows tremendous promise! It is evident that AI can do quite a lot – mimicking Shakespeare, debugging code; sending emails, reading emails – though it’s not at all clear how far it will go, or what consequences that will bring.
 Robots are adept at pattern recognition, which means they excel at applying the same solution to a problem over and over: churning out copy, reviewing legal documents, translating between languages. When humans do something ad nauseam, their eyes might glaze over, they slip up; chatbots don’t experience ennui.
 These tasks tend to overlap with some of those discussed in Graeber’s book. He identified categories of useless work including “flunkies,” who are paid to make rich and important people look more rich and important; “goons,” who are hired into positions that exist only because competitor companies created similar roles; and “box tickers,” which are, admittedly, subjective. Some economists, trying to make the designation more useful, have sharpened it: jobs that workers themselves find useless, and which produce work that could evaporate tomorrow with no real effect on the world.
 An obvious candidate for “flunky” automation is the executive assistant. IBM already allows users to build their own AI assistants. On Gmail, writers no longer have to compose their own responses, because auto reply generates choices like “yes, that works for me.” AI is even promising to take over personal logistics: AI startup Duckbill uses a combination of AI and human assistants to knock out rote to-do-list items entirely, from returning purchases to buying a child’s birthday present – chores that might have once been shunted to front-desk girls in the “Mad Men” era.Telemarketing, another area that AI is overtaking, qualifies as a “goon” job in Graeber’s assessment, because workers often sell products that they know customers don’t really want or need. Chatbots are good at this because they don’t care whether the task is fulfilling, or if customers are surly. Call centres like AT&T’s are already using AI to script calls with customer service representatives, which has made some of those representatives feel as if they are training their own replacements.
 Software engineering jobs can veer into “box ticking” territory. That was what Wang felt when he wrote lines of code that didn’t go live. As far as he could tell, the only function this work served was to help his bosses get promoted. He is keenly aware that much of this work could be automated.
 But whether or not these jobs provide a sense of existential purpose, they do provide reliable salaries. Many of the meaningless jobs that AI could overtake have traditionally opened up these white-collar fields to people who need opportunities and training, serving as accelerants for class mobility: paralegals, secretaries, assistants. Economists worry that when those jobs disappear, the ones that replace them will bring lower pay, fewer opportunities to ascend professionally and – even less meaning.
 “Even if we take Graeber’s view of those jobs, we should be concerned about eliminating them,” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is the hollowing out of the middle class.”
 It’s nearly impossible to imagine what the labour market will look like as AI improves and transforms our workplaces and our economy. But many workers booted from their meaningless jobs by AI could find new roles, ones that emerge through the process of automation. 
 It’s an old story: Technology has offset job losses with job creation throughout history. Horse drawn carriages were replaced by cars, which created jobs not just on auto assembly lines but also in car sales and gas stations. Personal computing eliminated some 3.5 million jobs, and then created an enormous industry and spurred many others, none of which could have been fathomed a century ago, making clear just why Keynes’ prediction in 1930 of 15-hour workweeks seems so far out of reach.
 Ultimately, while technology will transform work, it can’t displace people’s complicated feelings toward it.
 Wang says he certainly believes that will hold true in Silicon Valley. He predicts that automating pointless work will mean engineers get even more creative about seeking out their promotions. “These jobs exist on selling a vision,” he said. “I fear this is one problem you can’t automate.” — ©2024 The New York Times Company",brad wang job tech industry college silicon valley drudgery workplace sumptuousness game nap pod trail guest party jay gatsby house glitz hollowness software engineering role project google month initiative launch facebook product primary customer engineer unhelpful time pointlessness incense wang pie trash corporate office paperwork job decent salary benefit ergonomic keyboard climate comfort soul drudgery radical anthropologist david graeber distinct essay phenomenon bullshit job capitalist polemic wall street iconic slogan viral century frustration graeber book subject economist john maynard keynes hour workweek pas human million job useless people existence quarter workforce rich country job pointless study dutch economist dur max lent worker society argument job stake question artificial intelligence hurtles spectre job displacement estimate goldman generative automate activity equivalent time job office role administrator manager future technology replaces human effort productivity boon business disaster human obsolete possibility scenario kill job worker worker flunky goon ticker researcher sound human resource manager bushy summer intern tremendous promise evident lot shakespeare code email email consequence robot pattern recognition excel solution copy legal document language human nauseam eye slip chatbots ennui task overlap graeber book category useless flunky rich people rich goon position competitor company role box ticker subjective economist designation job worker useless evaporate tomorrow real obvious candidate flunky automation executive assistant ibm user assistant writer response auto generates choice personal logistics startup duckbill combination human assistant rote list item purchase child birthday chore front desk girl era telemarketing qualifies job graeber assessment worker product customer chatbots task fulfilling customer centre script customer service representative representative replacement software engineering job box territory wang line code function boss aware job sense existential purpose reliable salary job white collar field people opportunity accelerants class mobility paralegal assistant economist job lower pay fewer opportunity meaning graeber view job simon johnson economist institute technology middle class impossible imagine labour market transforms workplace economy worker meaningless job role process automation story technology job loss job creation history horse drawn carriage car job auto line car sale gas station personal computing job enormous industry fathomed century keynes hour workweek technology transform displace people feeling wang true silicon valley predicts pointless engineer promotion job vision fear automate york time company,"[(2, 0.13789923), (5, 0.85984695)]",5

 Ant Group said its Zhixiaobao app can help users “order meals, hail taxis, book tickets, and discover local dining and entertainment options” as well as access services in the digital payment app Alipay.
 Unveiled in Shanghai on Thursday, comes as tech giants such as Google, Meta and Microsoft ramp up investment in the AI market, with many firms touting tighter integration of chatbots.
 “Alipay is committed to harnessing AI’s potential to improve the user experience, ensuring that AI assistants like Zhixiaobao become valuable tools in everyday life for all,” Ant Group president Cyril Han said in a news release.
 Since Ant’s initial public offering was scrapped by Chinese authorities in 2020, the firm has been forced to overhaul its business model to satisfy financial regulators.

726352,Main,29,07/09/2024,"US, Britain, EU set  to sign  first global  treaty on AI",,"BENGALURU: The first legally binding international AI treaty has been opened for signing and adoption by the countries that negotiated it, which includes European Union members, the United States and Britain, the Council of Europe human rights organisation said.
 The AI Convention, which has been in the works for years and was adopted in May after discussions between 57 countries, addresses the risks AI may pose, while promoting responsible innovation.
 “This Convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law,” Britain’s justice minister, Shabana Mahmood, said in a statement.
 The AI Convention mainly focuses on the protection of human rights of people affected by AI systems and is separate from the EU AI Act, which entered into force last month.
 The EU’s AI Act entails comprehensive regulations on the development, deployment, and use of AI systems within the EU internal market.
 The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, is an international organisation distinct from the EU with a mandate to safeguard human rights; 46 countries are members, including all the 27 EU member states.
 An ad hoc committee in 2019 started examining the feasibility of an AI framework convention and a Committee on Artificial Intelligence was formed in 2022 which drafted and negotiated the text.
 The countries who become  signatories can choose to adopt  or maintain legislative, administrative or other measures to give effect to the provisions.
 Francesca Fanucci, a legal expert at the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law Stichting who contributed to the treaty’s drafting process alongside other civil society groups, said in an interview that the agreement had been “watered down” into a broad set of principles.
 “The formulation of principles and obligations in this convention is so overbroad and fraught with caveats.
 “It raises serious questions about their legal certainty and effective enforceability,” Fanucci said.
 The legal expert also highlighted exemptions on AI systems used for national security purposes, and limited scrutiny of private companies versus the public sector, as flaws. 
 “This double standard is disappointing,” she added.

726466,Lifestyle,2,07/09/2024,"A visit to Norway, guided by AI",,"THE assignment was clear: Test how well artificial intelligence could plan a trip to Norway, a place I’d never been. So I did none of my usual obsessive online research and instead asked three AI planners to create a four-day itinerary. 
 None of them, alas, mentioned the saunas or the salmon.
 Two assistants were, however, eager to learn more about me  in order to tailor their initially generic recommendations, which they had spewed out within  seconds. 
 Vacay, a personalised travel planning tool, presented me with a list of questions, while Mindtrip, a new AI travel assistant, invited me to take a quiz. (ChatGPT, the third assistant, asked nothing.)
 Vacay’s and Mindtrip’s questions were similar: Are you travelling solo? What’s your budget? Do you prefer hotels or Airbnbs? Would you rather explore the great outdoors or pursue a cultural experience?
 Eventually, my chat sessions yielded what seemed like well-rounded itineraries, starting with one day in Oslo and moving on to the fjord region. Eventually, I locked down a trip that would combine the assistants’ information and go beyond a predictable list of sites.
 This time around, my virtual planners were far more sophisticated than the simple ChatGPT interface I used last year on a trip to Milan in Italy. Though it offered more detailed suggestions for Norway, I ended up ditching ChatGPT in the travel-planning stage after it repeatedly crashed.
 Vacay’s premium service, which starts at US$9.99 (RM43.60) per month, included in-depth suggestions and booking links, while Mindtrip, which is currently free, provided photos, Google reviews and maps. During the trip itself, each delivered instantaneous information by text and always asked if more specific details were needed. 
 Sadly, only ChatGPT offered a phone app, whose information I found to be outdated (the premium version is more current).
 I’m not alone when it comes to turning to AI for help: Around 70% of Americans are either using or planning to use AI for travel planning, according to a recent survey conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of the personal finance app Moneylion, while 71% said using AI would most likely be easier than planning trips on one’s own.
 I decided to find out for myself in Norway.
 A whirlwind day in Oslo 
 After I landed at Oslo Airport, all three assistants directed me  to the Flytoget Airport Express Train, which got me to the city in 20 minutes. I was delighted to find my hotel adjacent to the  central railway station.
 Choosing accommodations had not been easy. I was looking for a mid-range boutique hotel, and the AI assistants generated many options with little overlap. 
 I went with Hotel Amerikalinjen, Vacay’s recommendation, which it described as “a vibrant and unique boutique hotel in the heart of Oslo”. Its location was the main draw, but overall the hotel exceeded my expectations, blending comfort and style with the 20th-century charm of its building, which once housed the headquarters of the Norwegian America Line shipping company.
 For the one-day Oslo itinerary, the assistants were in agreement, packing in the city’s top sights, including the Vigeland Sculpture Park, the Royal Palace, the Nobel Peace Centre, Akershus Fortress and the Munch Museum. 
 I shared my location and asked each assistant to restructure the itineraries to start from my hotel. But when I gave in to my own research instincts and pulled up Google Maps, I saw that the order they suggested didn’t make sense, so I plotted my own path.
 By the time I got to Frogner Park at midday, I had already covered half of the sights, and after walking past more than 200 sculptures by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, I was happy to sit down and admire his granite monolith of entwined humans.
 For lunch, the assistants recommended high-end restaurants in the bustling waterfront neighbourhood of Aker Brygge. But I wanted a quick bite in a more relaxed atmosphere, so I ditched AI and walked to the end of the promenade, where I stumbled upon The Salmon, a cosy establishment where I started with salmon sashimi that melted in my mouth and finished with a perfectly grilled fillet. 
 How had my assistants not mentioned this place?
 Next on my list was the Nobel Peace Centre, the Opera House and the Munch Museum. The assistants had not recommended pre-booking tickets, but fortunately, I had done so, learning, in the process, that the Peace Centre was closed, a crucial bit of information that AI did not relay.
 It was chilly for mid-June,  and as I walked along the harbour promenade toward the Munch Museum, I spotted small floating saunas, which my assistants had not included. I went back to the ChatGPT phone app for recommendations. 
 Even though I was eager to try a floating sauna, where people warmed themselves and then plunged straight into the frigid waters of the Oslofjord, I took ChatGPT’s suggestion and booked the Salt sauna, which is where I headed after spending a few hours at the Munch Museum, with its extensive works by the Norwegian artist and its sweeping views of Oslo’s harbour.
 At the Salt cultural complex, a large pyramidal structure on the water, I was relieved that swimsuits were a requirement. In Scandinavia, saunas are usually taken naked, and earlier, I had asked ChatGPT for the etiquette at Salt, but it failed to give me a definitive answer. After sweating it out with around 30 strangers in Salt’s main sauna, I dipped into a cold-water barrel tub and then tried the smaller sauna options, which were hotter and quieter. It was the perfect ending to a long day.
 Waterfalls, valleys,  raging waters 
 Each of my assistants had different ideas on how to reach the fjord region. ChatGPT suggested taking a seven-hour train ride and then immediately embarking on a two-hour fjord cruise, which sounded exhausting. 
 Mindtrip suggested taking a short flight to Bergen, known as the “gateway to the fjords”, and setting out on a cruise the next day, which was perhaps more efficient, but would also mean missing one of the most scenic train rides in the world. 
 Vacay also recommended a train ride.
 After conversing with the assistants, I decided on a shorter train journey (six hours) that would deliver me to Naeroy-fjord, a Unesco World Heritage Site with lush valleys and thundering waterfalls. But to figure out the logistics for transport and accommodation, I needed live train timetables, which I found on my own, and information on hotel availability that none of the assistants had.
 At this point, I was desperate for human guidance to navigate the region’s expensive and limited accommodations. This is where the pictures and reviews on Mindtrip were useful, helping me to understand that I would be paying premium prices for the spectacular setting of a mediocre hotel.
 The train ride from Oslo to Myrdal was breathtaking: rolling hills, mountain villages, fjords, waterfalls. But nothing prepared me for the majestic one-hour Flam railway ride that followed. Vacay had described it as an “engineering marvel” with a breathtakingly steep descent as it passes picturesque villages, dramatic mountains, raging rivers and pounding waterfalls, complete with a dance performance featuring a mythological spirit known as a huldra.
 The next morning I boarded a Naeroyfjord cruise, recommended by Vacay, on an electric, 400-person vessel. I was surprised by the serenity of the fjord. Later I learned from a tour guide that I had been lucky to visit when there were no large cruise ships. 
 It was hard to imagine an ocean liner manoeuvring through the narrow, windy fjord, but when I asked ChatGPT, it told me 150 to 220 cruise ships squeezed through the fjord each year, a detail that I felt the travel assistants should warn travellers about.
 The cruise ended in the village of Gudvangen, where rain made me cancel a hike to a waterfall and instead try my hand at axe-throwing in the Viking Village Njardarheimr. The assistants had told me that there were buses that left town every four hours, a time frame that had worked with my original hiking plan, but now I was stuck. 
 Thankfully, I took note of the AI disclaimers to check all information and found an alternative shuttle bus.
 On my way to Bergen, I decided to stop in the town of Voss, famous for extreme sports like skydiving and spectacular nature. All the AI-suggested hotels were booked, but a Google search led me to the lakeside Elva hotel, which had delicious farm-to-table food. I suspect it didn’t make the AI shortlist because it was new.
 I ended my trip in Bergen, which, despite being Norway’s second-largest city, maintains a small-town charm with its colourful wooden houses and cobblestone streets. With only half a day to explore, I followed Mindtrip’s short itinerary, starting with a hearty lunch of fish and chips at the bustling waterfront fish market and ending with a funicular ride up Mount Floyen for panoramic views of the city and fjords. 
 The AI dinner suggestion at the Colonialen was perfect: cosy vibe, live jazz and locally sourced dishes.
 The bottom line 
 None of the AI programmes were perfect, but they did complement one another, allowing me to streamline my travel decisions.
 Overall, Mindtrip – with its polished, dynamic interface that allowed me to cross-check details with maps, links and reviews – was my favourite. While it gave some good recommendations, Mindtrip needed more prompting than Vacay, which offered a wider variety of suggestions in more detail. 
 Unfortunately, Vacay doesn’t save chat history, which I discovered halfway into my planning after closing the website’s tab on my browser.
 The biggest drawback was the absence of phone apps for Mindtrip and Vacay, which led me to rely on ChatGPT’s basic AI assistant when I needed on-the-spot guidance. Mindtrip, I’ve since learned, is planning to debut an app this month. 
 Still, there were times when I desperately craved the human touch. Before setting out on a trip, I always contact friends and colleagues for recommendations. This time, as part of the AI experiment, I refrained from reaching out to a Norwegian friend until after my trip, only to find out that we had both been in Oslo at the same time.

726126,Main,26,06/09/2024,Australia  mulls targeted  AI rules,,"SYDNEY: Australia’s centre-left government said it planned to introduce targeted artificial intelligence rules including human intervention and transparency amid a rapid rollout of AI tools by businesses and in everyday life.

 “Australians know AI can do great things but people want to know there are protections in place if things go off the rails,” he said in a statement yesterday. 
 “Australians want stronger protections on AI, we’ve heard that, we’ve listened.”
 The report containing the guidelines said it was critical to enable human control as required across an AI system’s lifecycle.
 “Meaningful human oversight will let you intervene if you need to and reduce the potential for unintended consequences and harms,” the report said.

724936,StarBiz,12,03/09/2024,Harnessing AI to rapidly accelerate Vietnam’s economic expansion,,"HANOI: In the dynamic landscape of South-East Asia, Vietnam is poised on the brink of a technological revolution, aiming to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to redefine its economy, foster innovation, boost productivity and enhance global competitiveness.
 In its July 2024 report, An AI Opportunity Agenda for Vietnam, Google emphasised the critical role of digitalisation and AI in transforming Vietnam’s economy, making it more diversified and competitive on regional and global scales.
 The report estimated that AI could generate up to US$835bil in economic benefits across six South-East Asian economies, including Vietnam, by 2030. 
 To achieve the goal of having the digital economy contribute 30% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030 – up from 12% in 2023 – Vietnam must attract significant investment and drive AI innovation.
 Google’s research highlighted that AI will play a crucial role in Vietnam’s digital economy, potentially generating an annual economic impact of 1.73 quadrillion dong or about US$69.5bil by 2030. 
 The study, covering 43 sectors, found that more than half could achieve breakthroughs through AI.
 AI is expected to bolster Vietnam’s manufacturing competitiveness, advance the electric vehicle (EV) industry, and help meet green-energy goals. It will also enhance agricultural efficiency, address climate challenges, and support economic growth.
 Moreover, AI is vital for Vietnam’s ambition to become a high-income developed country by 2045, driving productivity, attracting investment, creating high-tech jobs, and supporting micro, small, and medium enterprises, according to the report.
 Despite the critical role of productivity growth in economic development, Vietnam has missed its labour productivity targets for three consecutive years, with the 2024 goal set lower than in 2023.
 The Vietnam’s Future Digital Economy towards 2030 and 2045 report estimates that the digital economy could contribute 7% to 16.5% annually to productivity growth from 2020 to 2030. 
 Although the impact is initially modest, AI could significantly boost productivity, potentially doubling GDP contributions compared to new business models, according to McKinsey.
 “This isn’t merely about typical development; it’s about breakthrough growth. Advancing AI applications will also catalyse the growth of tech startups in Vietnam,” said Do Tien Thinh, deputy director of the National Innovation Centre (NIC).
 Vietnam is already harnessing AI to enhance its competitiveness as a manufacturing hub, particularly in high-tech industries like electronics and telecommunications. 
 Leading Vietnamese enterprises such as Viettel, FPT, VinAI, CMC, and VNPT are at the forefront of AI innovation, demonstrating the technology’s potential to benefit a wide range of businesses.
 Investment in AI is also rising, with over US$4.6bil invested in Vietnamese startups from 2014 to 2023, according to the 2024 Vietnam Technology and Innovation Investment report by NIC and Do Ventures. 
 This reflects Vietnam’s burgeoning status as a centre for technological innovation.
 Oxford Insights, in its early 2024 report, ranked Vietnam 59th out of 193 countries and territories for government AI readiness, and fifth in the Asean region. The report highlighted Vietnam’s vibrant economy, youthful and tech-savvy population, burgeoning tech sector, and influx of international investment as fertile grounds for AI innovation.
 Research by Thundermark Capital also listed Vietnam and Singapore as the two South-East Asian representatives in the global Top 30 for AI research.
 Vietnam’s position in AI development is supported by several key advantages.
 The country’s burgeoning digital economy, aimed at contributing 20% of GDP by 2025 and 30% by 2030, provides a strong foundation for AI integration.
 The rapid growth of Vietnam’s Internet economy, already among the fastest-growing in the world, further strengthens its position.
 Vietnam’s young, tech-savvy population is also a significant asset. 
 The country has a large pool of engineers and IT professionals, many well-versed in AI technologies. This, combined with a strong emphasis on STEM education, ensures a steady pipeline of talent to drive AI innovation.
 Many major international companies see Vietnam as a promising research and development hub.

724734,Lifestyle,6,02/09/2024,AI’s translation troubles,"When AI fails the  language test, who  is left out of the conversation?","STANFORD researchers gave a popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot a language test.
 They asked the bot in Vietnamese to write a traditional poem in the form known as “song that luc bat” that follows a pattern of lines made up of seven, seven, six, then eight words. When the bot spit out an answer, it wrote a poem but didn’t follow the format.
 The team tried a different prompt, asking what the proper Vietnamese word was for a mother’s younger brother, and it responded with the words for a father’s younger and older siblings.
 These flaws are not unique to Claude 3.5, the chatbot by the AI company Anthropic that the researchers queried, but they illustrate some of the ways in which AI can get language outside of standard American English wrong.
 While the use of AI has exploded in the West, much of the rest of the world has been left out of the conversation since most of the technology is trained in English. AI experts worry that the language gap could exacerbate technological inequities and that it could leave many regions and cultures behind.
 A delay of access to good technology of even a few years “can potentially lead to a few decades of economic delay”, said Sang Truong, a doctoral candidate at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University, on the team that built and tested a Vietnamese language model against others.
 The tests his team ran found that AI tools across the board could get facts and diction wrong when working with Vietnamese, likely because it is a “low-resource” language by industry standards, which means that there aren’t sufficient data sets and content available online for the AI model to learn from.
 Low-resource languages are spoken by tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of people around the world, but they yield less digital data because AI tech development and online engagement are centred in the United States and China. Other low-resource languages include Hindi, Bengali and Swahili, as well as lesser-known dialects spoken by smaller populations around the world.
 An analysis of top websites by W3Techs, a tech survey company, found that English makes up more than 60% of the Internet’s language data. 
 While English is widely spoken globally, native English speakers make up about 5% of the population, according to Ethnologue, a research organisation that collects language data. Mandarin and Spanish are other examples of languages with a significant online presence and reliable digital data sets.
 Academic institutions, grassroots organisations and volunteer efforts are playing catch-up to build resources for speakers of languages who aren’t as well represented in the digital landscape.
 Lelapa AI, based in Johannesburg, is one such company leading efforts on the African continent. The South African-based startup is developing multilingual AI products for people and businesses in Africa.
 “I think it’s such a dangerous concept that people need to assimilate to a different culture and have to take on different cultures in order to have access to progress,” said Pelonomi Moiloa, CEO and co-founder of Lelapa AI.
 The company is less focused on scale than on community-specific solutions, she said. It is crafting its products to be more resource- efficient, cost-effective and to be used primarily for speech-to-speech communication in the local languages, which make the technology more accessible to African people.
 “Large companies like Google, Apple, OpenAI, for example, have not necessarily trained their models for tools that serve these markets,” Chinasa T. Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, said about communities with low-resource languages. “They don’t provide enough market value for them to do so.”
 A communications officer for OpenAI said the company releases AI systems steadily to more groups of people and that its latest model supports more than 50 languages. 
 Google pointed to its projects focussing on AI development for under-represented languages, including a “1,000 languages” initiative, announced in 2022, to build language models for the 1,000 most-spoken languages in the world. Apple said it, too, has developed products to support a range of languages.
 The consequences of the language gap in AI tools can be numerous. The technology has the potential to increase productivity and change workplaces, but without reliable data in local languages, some regions of the world could miss out on the economic benefits, according to AI experts. The exclusion of low-resource languages could also lead to cultural bias in AI products.
 AI’s lack of knowledge in low-resource languages has the potential to raise security concerns as well. Sara Hooker, the head of Cohere for AI, the non-profit research arm of the startup Cohere, said some users could bypass the safety measures of AI products by asking questions in other languages.
 “You can easily, for example, still get very dangerous instructions about how to build a bomb just by switching to a different language,” Hooker said.
 While the issue is obvious to many in the industry, the solutions are complicated. Large-language models (LLMs), which are used to communicate in human language, require large banks of high-quality data, often collected from the Internet and not easily accessible for low-resource languages. Truong equated building an LLM to teaching a newborn: There may be 20,000 books with lessons in English, but there are just five in Vietnamese.
 The disparity is so large in some regions that governments have stepped in to back efforts to build their own language models. The Nigerian government promised to back the tech startup Awarri in building a model for local languages. Both Iceland’s government and the Welsh government work with OpenAI to improve ChatGPT’s understanding of the native languages there.

723660,Main,23,30/08/2024,UK launches AI project to help teachers with school,,"London: The UK government announced a “first-of-its kind” £4mil (RM23mil) project to bolster artificial intelligence tools to help teachers plan lessons and mark homework.
 As part of project, government documents like curriculum guidance, lesson plans, and student assessments will be provided to AI companies to train their tech to “generate accurate, high-quality content, like tailored, creative lesson plans and workbooks”.
 The generative AI tools will help teachers mark work and create teaching material, the science and education departments said in a press release.
 “Today’s world-leading an­nouncement marks a huge step forward for AI in the classroom,” said early education minister Stephen Morgan, part of the recently elected Labour government on Wednesday.
 Science Secretary Peter Kyle said the project aims to “ease admin burdens” and will “transform how we see and use public sector data”.
 The project claims to have a “first-of-its kind approach to processing government data for AI”.
 A government-commissioned research paper on public attitudes to AI in education published on Wednesday found that while those surveyed agreed AI could help teachers, there were concerns of over-reliance on the technology.
 Parents and students “were worried about the loss of key social and technical skills and reduced human contact-time leading to unintended adverse outcomes”, according to the research.
 UK schools have been rocked in recent years by teaching strikes over a decrease in salaries in real terms, while struggling to retain teaching staff in sufficient numbers. — AFP",london government mil mil project bolster artificial intelligence tool teacher lesson mark homework project government document guidance lesson plan student assessment company tech generate accurate quality content creative lesson plan generative tool teacher create material science education department press release nouncement mark huge step classroom education minister stephen morgan labour government wednesday science secretary peter kyle project admin burden public sector data project approach government data government paper public attitude education wednesday teacher concern reliance technology parent student worried loss key social technical skill human contact time unintended adverse outcome school strike decrease salary real term retain teaching staff sufficient afp,"[(0, 0.43430448), (2, 0.14037126), (6, 0.41946366)]",0
723022,Main,17,29/08/2024,Ensuring that AI serves humanity,,"IN the grand theatre of human progress, we stand on the precipice of a new act where the protagonists are not flesh and blood but silicon and code. 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI), once the stuff of science fiction, has stepped into the spotlight, promising to revolutionise every corner of our existence. Yet, as we marvel at the brilliance of these artificial minds, we must ask ourselves: Are we dancing with the future, or are we being led astray by a digital pied piper?
 AI is a double-edged sword, its sharpness promising to both heal and harm. Like a painter with infinite brushes, it has the power to create masterpieces of efficiency, precision, and innovation. 
 In medicine, AI holds the potential to diagnose diseases with an accuracy that rivals the best of human doctors. In agriculture, it can predict and manage crop yields with unparalleled foresight. 
 In every sector, AI promises to be the lighthouse guiding us through the fog of complexity.
 But even as we celebrate these advances, we must not lose sight of the shadows that AI casts. The very intelligence we admire is also the harbinger of a profound disruption – one that threatens to unravel the delicate fabric of our society. 
 Jobs once considered safe and secure are being swallowed by the insatiable maw of automation. The artisan, craftsman, and skilled worker – figures who have shaped civilisations – now find themselves at risk of obsolescence, replaced by machines that do not tire, err, or need a paycheck. 
 More insidious still is the potential for AI to amplify the biases and prejudices that have long plagued humanity. These artificial minds, despite their inhuman brilliance, are not immune to the flaws of their creators. 
 In the hands of the reckless, AI can become a weapon, perpetuating inequalities and injustices with a speed and scale unimaginable in the analogue world. 
 The biases coded into algorithms, whether by design or oversight, can lead to decisions that are as unjust as they are invisible, hidden behind a veneer of mathematical objectivity.
 In our pursuit of artificial intelligence, we may be at risk of losing something deeply human. The poet in us might falter as we come to rely more on the cold logic of machines and less on the warmth of human intuition. The philosopher in us might wither as we outsource our moral dilemmas to systems that calculate without conscience. 
 The very essence of what it means to be human – empathy, creativity, and ethical reasoning – may be eroded as we increasingly defer to our digital counterparts.
 But there is hope. The story of AI is not yet written, and the pen remains in our hands. We must approach this new era with both optimism and caution, balancing our excitement with a deep sense of responsibility. 
 The key lies in ensuring that AI serves humanity, not the other way around. We must demand transparency, fairness, and accountability from those who design and deploy these systems. We must champion the values that make us human – compassion, justice, and respect for the dignity of all people – as we navigate this uncharted territory.
 In the end, the irony of intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is that it is both a gift and a burden. Like fire, it can warm our homes or burn them to the ground. The challenge before us is to harness this new flame to ensure that it illuminates rather than incinerates.

722334,StarBiz,12,27/08/2024,Vietnam’s manufacturing growth hinges on AI to spur GDP,,"HANOI: While digital transformation is a priority for manufacturers, around 30% to 40% of global and Asia-Pacific (Apac) respondents recognise achieving it is fraught with obstacles.
 Those barriers include the cost and availability of labour, scaling technology solutions and the convergence of information technology and operational technology.
 The information was released at the findings of 2024 Manufacturing Vision Study from Zebra Technologies Corp, a leading digital solution provider enabling businesses to intelligently connect data, assets and people.
 The study showed that globally, 61% of manufacturers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth by 2029, up from 41% in 2024.
 In Apac, 68% of manufacturers expect AI to drive growth by 2029, increasing from 46% in 2024. 
 This surge in AI adoption, combined with 92% global and 87% of Apac survey respondents prioritising digital transformation, underscores manufacturers’ intent to improve data management and leverage new technologies that enhance visibility and quality throughout the manufacturing process. 
 In Vietnam, the government has consistently set ambitious targets for the manufacturing sector, with it expected to contribute 30% to the overall gross domestic product (GDP).
 The sector’s contribution to GDP is expected to grow by more than 8.5% per annum, while labour productivity is forecast to grow 7.5% per annum. 
 To achieve these goals, Vietnamese businesses must embrace the need for reskilling and retraining their workforce to stay competitive. Adopting AI and other advanced technologies is crucial for enhancing productivity, improving quality and streamlining operations.

721878,StarMetro,6,26/08/2024,Industry spotlight on tech and AI,Professionals share best sustainability practices at KL conference,"Academics, industry experts and innovators put their heads together to explore the critical role of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing sustainability and regeneration.
 The Sustainable Brands Kuala Lumpur (SBKL) 2024 conference held at the Sime Darby Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur, featured over 25  speakers.
 They included industry leaders, innovators and sustainability advocates who shared insights and best practices on utilising technology and AI to drive change.
 Recent extreme climate conditions, overpopulation, social inequity and unchecked development heightened the urgency of leveraging technology and AI to accelerate the necessary transitions for brands and companies.
 Also at the event was former Cabinet minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who spoke about empowering youths to shape a sustainable future, in his new role as a radio presenter and podcaster.
 Other keynote presentations and panel discussions delved into a broad range of topics, including technology from a living systems perspective, smart energy systems and sustainable supply chain management.
 Conference convenor Sharmini Nagulan, who is Acacia Blue managing director, said the intersection of technology and sustainability was no longer a theoretical discussion but a crucial part of reality.
 “As we face unprecedented environmental challenges, we can harness the power of AI and technology to create regenerative solutions that benefit both people and the planet,” she said.
 Another highlight of the event was the opening address of Sustainable Brands Worldwide chief executive officer Mike Dupee.
 “We recognise that addressing systemic challenges requires systemic solutions, and so we remain focused on bringing our global community together to address these challenges in a context that aligns social and environmental benefits with shared economic prosperity,”  he said.
 Invictus Blue Group president Keith Miranda noted that for  sustainability to work, it must  be recognised as a shared  responsibility among government, businesses and the public.
 He added that people no longer view sustainability as a ‘nice to have’, but rather as a necessity in life.
 “The challenge is to encourage an orderly and responsible transition that leaves no one behind.
 “Invictus Blue, as a 30-year homegrown integrated communications agency, is committed to supporting brands and businesses on this journey to make the planet a better place,” said Miranda.
 Attendees engaged in dynamic discussions, networked with like-minded professionals and participated in workshops designed to foster collaboration and innovation.
 In a statement, SBKL 2024 organiser Acacia Blue emphasised its commitment to creating a more sustainable event. 
 This year’s initiatives included plant-based catering options, reusable conference materials and a focus on minimising waste.The conference concluded with a call to action, encouraging participants to adopt sustainable practices within their organisations and personal lives.

721902,Lifestyle,6,26/08/2024,The AI fear factor,"‘Why do I need AI in my coffee maker?’ AI-labelled products can scare away customers, a study finds.","DESPITE almost a quarter of US adults using ChatGPT and thousands of companies integrating artificial intelligence into their operations, many consumers haven’t ditched the fear of a Terminator-style AI takeover. That could be bad news for brands trying to convince customers to buy their AI-stamped products.
 A study published in the Journal Of Hospitality Market And Management in June found consumers were less interested in purchasing an item if it was labelled with the term “AI”. 
 Across a series of studies, participants were asked about their intention to buy a product – from televisions to vacuums to consumer and health services – labelled with one of two descriptors, “AI-powered” or “high tech”.
 Among about 200 participants across age and gender demographics, the impact of AI labels on a consumer’s willingness to buy a product was unanimous, according to Dogan Gursoy, a hospitality management professor at Washington State University’s Carson College of Business and one of the study’s authors.
 “In every single case,” Gursoy said, “whenever we mentioned ‘AI’ versus ‘high tech’, consumers’ purchase intention went down.”
 Indeed, shoppers are largely threatened by AI, with only 30% of respondents saying they trust generative AI, according to a Cognizant survey of 1,000 US consumers. 
 Almost three-fourths of respondents believed genAI would increase corporate profits, and 28% believed genAI would benefit consumers the least compared to corporations, small businesses, employees, and the government.
 Brands have largely overestimated consumer trust in AI, Gursoy said, and he has the research to support his claim. When consumers had lower emotional trust, a critical factor in determining if a shopper will buy a product, they also had low purchase intentions for products labelled “AI-powered”. Purchase intentions and emotional trust were lower for items participants considered higher risk, such as cars.
 Identity threats and  existential fears
 For many consumers, the anxiety around AI stems from an identity threat the technology poses, Gursoy said. The fear of AI taking over humanity – exemplified in Gen Z’s fear of losing their jobs to the technology – is still salient.
 “It threatens my identity, threatens the human identity,” Gursoy said. “Nothing’s supposed to be more intelligent than us.”
 These fears have been exacerbated by consumer concerns over privacy, with most consumers saying their trust in AI has already been eroded by organisations using the technology, per Cisco’s 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey. 
 Lawmakers are reacting accordingly: The proliferation of deepfake video and audio content caused Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell to sound the alarm over AI, warning companies that use the technology that they must abide by the commonwealth’s consumer-protection and data-privacy laws. Amazon’s use of a palm-scanning payment system at Whole Foods stores sparked concern from cybersecurity experts.
 “Any time you entrust your data with a private corporation, you’re trusting that company to keep that data safe. And most of the time, you probably shouldn’t,” Evan Greer, director of tech regulation advocacy group Fight for the Future, told CNBC.
 Amazon Web Services’ chief information security officer Chris Betz said in a June blog post the company is prioritising security as it continues to invest in genAI.
 No one’s getting it right
 Since there’s already distrust towards AI, brands producing and advertising AI-powered products have an uphill battle ahead. Consumers need to be convinced of AI’s benefits in a particular product, Gursoy said: “Many people question, Why do I need AI in my coffee maker, or why do I need AI in my refrigerator or my vacuum cleaner?”
 The only problem is that no company has been able to successfully tap into this strategy, he argued.
 “Companies are not doing a great job of that kind of messaging,” Gursoy said. “Everyone is keeping the AI development or what’s going on with AI a secret, and that’s understandable. But consumers also need to know that their data is safe.”
 In order for consumers to purchase items espousing the utility of AI, brands need to first assuage anxieties around the technology. That means companies spelling out the benefits of a product thanks to AI and increasing transparency practices around data usage.
 “There are always people who will never want that,” Gursoy said. “But for a large portion of consumers, we need to nudge their mind.” – Fortune.com/The New York Times",quarter adult thousand company artificial intelligence operation consumer fear terminator style takeover bad news brand convince customer product journal hospitality market management june consumer item labelled term series study intention product television consumer health service descriptor tech participant age gender demographic label consumer willingness product unanimous dogan gursoy hospitality management professor washington university carson college business study author single gursoy versus tech consumer intention shopper respondent generative cognizant survey consumer fourth respondent genai increase corporate profit genai benefit consumer corporation business employee government brand consumer trust gursoy support claim consumer lower emotional trust critical factor shopper buy product low purchase intention product purchase intention emotional trust item participant risk car identity existential fear consumer identity threat technology gursoy fear humanity gen fear job technology salient identity human identity gursoy intelligent fear consumer concern privacy consumer organisation technology cisco consumer privacy survey lawmaker proliferation deepfake video audio content massachusetts attorney andrea campbell sound alarm company technology consumer protection data privacy law palm payment system food store concern cybersecurity expert time entrust data private corporation company data safe time evan greer director tech regulation advocacy fight future cnbc amazon web service chief security officer chris betz june blog post company security invest genai distrust brand advertising product uphill battle consumer benefit product gursoy people coffee maker refrigerator vacuum cleaner company tap strategy company job gursoy development secret understandable consumer data safe consumer item utility brand assuage anxiety technology company benefit product transparency practice usage people portion consumer fortune york time,"[(2, 0.9963658)]",2
720962,StarBiz,11,23/08/2024,Snowflake outlook fails to calm investors on AI,,"NEW YORK: Snowflake Inc gave a sales outlook that failed to reassure investors that the company will gain ground in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) software tools. 
 The shares fell in extended trading.
 Product revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflake’s business, will be US$850mil to US$855mil in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. 
 Analysts, on average, predicted US$848mil, although some estimates exceeded US$900mil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its financial-year product sales forecast to US$3.36bil from US$3.3bil.
 Under chief executive officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has launched products focused on generative AI and other new ways to analyse large sets of data. 
 The strategy is fuelled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake offers software that helps customers find, organise and use huge amounts of information from a variety of sources.
 Ramaswamy touted “product delivery, and great traction in the early stages of our new AI products”.
 Still, Snowflake is navigating a challenging environment between a recent chief executive change, security breaches of its customers and some market shift to products outside its traditional wheelhouse, wrote Derrick Wood, an analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the results.
 In its financial second quarter, total revenue rose 29% to US$868.8mil – coming in under 30% for the first time in Snowflake’s history as a publicly traded company.
 The shares declined about 7% in extended trading after closing at US$135.06 in New York. 
 The stock has dropped 32% this year, as investors have been concerned about Snowflake’s ability to catch up in AI-oriented tools.
 Clients including AT&T Inc, Live Nation Entertainment Inc’s Ticketmaster and LendingTree Inc had their Snowflake accounts breached as part of a hacking campaign beginning in May. 
 Snowflake has said its own systems weren’t infiltrated and has added features for customers to implement better security settings.
 “We obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,” Ramaswamy said of the customer breaches during a conference call after the results were released. “The issue wasn’t on the Snowflake side.”
 Product revenue increased 30% to US$829mil in the quarter, compared with the US$813mil expected by analysts.

 Lingo Telecom, the voice service provider that transmitted the robocalls, agreed on Wed­nesday to the settlement to resolve enforcement action taken by the Federal Communications Commission, which had initially sought a US$2mil (RM8.74mil) fine.
 The case is seen by many as an unsettling early example of how AI might be used to influence groups of voters and democracy as a whole.
 Meanwhile Steve Kramer, a political consultant who orchestrated the calls, still faces a proposed US$6mil (RM26.2mil) FCC fine as well as state criminal charges.
 The phone messages were sent to thousands of New Hampshire voters on Jan 21. 
 They featured a voice similar to Biden’s falsely suggesting that voting in the state’s presidential primary would preclude them from casting ballots in the Nov­ember general election.
 Kramer, who paid a magician and self-described “digital nomad” to create the recording, said earlier this year that he wasn’t trying to influence the outcome of the primary, but he rather wanted to highlight the potential dangers of AI and spur lawmakers into action.If found guilty, Kramer could face a prison sentence of up to seven years on a charge of voter suppression and a sentence of up to one year on a charge of impersonating a candidate. — AP",meredith company deceptive call hampshire voter artificial intelligence mimic presi dent joe biden voice pay mil fine federal regulator telecom voice service provider robocalls nesday settlement enforcement action federal communication commission mil fine unsettling influence voter democracy political consultant call mil mil fcc fine criminal charge phone message thousand voter featured voice biden presidential primary preclude ballot nov ember election kramer magician digital nomad create earlier influence outcome primary potential danger spur lawmaker action guilty kramer prison sentence charge voter suppression sentence charge candidate,"[(5, 0.9886706)]",5
720200,StarBiz,6,21/08/2024,AI-powered system to hunt down financial scammers,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Regulators and financial institutions are taking further steps to address the elevated prevalence of financial scams.
 Bank Negara, Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) and financial institutions yesterday launched the National Fraud Portal, an artificial intelligence-driven system that helps to strengthen the operational capabilities of the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC).
 The NFP automates the end-to-end process of handling scam reports and tracing of stolen funds by the NSRC.
 The process, which was manually done by the NSRC prior to this, vastly improves a victim’s chances of recovering funds should they fall prey to any scams.
 However, Bank Negara deputy governor Marzunisham Omar said it is important that reports pertaining to scammed funds be lodged as quickly as possible after it is discoverd by making a call the NSRC’s 997 hotline or bank hotlines.
 “Whenever a scam happens, the funds are withdrawn from the victim’s accounts and transferred to the mule accounts. 
 “In a matter of seconds or minutes, this will move from one account to another. When we started NSRC, most of the tracing was done manually. 
 “Let’s say the money is at Bank A, we will manually need to call them. Or if it has moved to Bank B or Bank C, we will quickly need to call them manually to hold the funds,” Marzunisham said at a press briefing yesterday.
 “But now we are automating this process, there is no need for calls any more. So we can trace these funds quickly. 
 “But the important thing is the victim must report it to the NSRC very quickly, if not the money will be moved and withdrawn then it is lost,” he added.
 He said the system is also expected to promote industry-wide information sharing and collaboration, enabling financial institutions to exchange details and intelligence regarding online fraud incidents, which also involves mule accounts.
 The NFP would also standardise the industry’s approach to handling mule accounts, ensuring that account holders affected by such activities continue to have access to essential financial services.
 Along with the NFP, the financial industry has also agreed to adopt industry-wide procedures for reporting and handling mule accounts. 
 The procedures enhance the quality of industry-wide information on mule accounts through streamlined classification, the NSRC said. 
 It also standardises the industry’s approach towards treating mules to ensure account holders affected by the activities of mule accounts can continue to access basic financial services, NSRC added.

 The Chinese financial technology company will also provide AI-powered intelligent services for more enterprises.
 He Zhengyu, chief technology officer of Ant Group said the company will strive for technological innovation and invest heavily in AI technology, represented by large language models, while bolstering sharing of data and unleashing the value of massive data resources.
 The company recently set up its innovation and technology headquarters in Beijing at a new campus called T-Space, marking a significant move in its expansion into the high-tech sector.
 At the T-Space launch, Eric Jing, chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Group, said the company would make full use of Beijing’s advantages in talent and technological innovation, increase investments and usher in a new chapter for Ant.
 Ant Group has also established a new subsidiary in Beijing, which offers intelligent customer services, marketing, operation, and technology research and development.
 Jing said this is aimed at helping clients improve management efficiency and reduce costs via AI-powered technology.
 The new subsidiary is part of Ant’s heightened efforts to promote the commercialisation and industrial application of AI technology, and help enterprises achieve digital and intelligent transformation and upgrade.
 The company’s technological research institute, which is also located in Beijing, mainly concentrates on making breakthroughs in core and cutting-edge technologies related to data elements and AI, such as intelligent robots, data storage and high-performance real-time graphic computing technology.
 Technology is an important strategic direction for Ant.

 The celebrities urge the public to be extra mindful of content  they see online and always cross-check the information to avoid falling for scams.
 Popular singer Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza Tarudin became one of the affected celebrities when her voice was exploited by scammers using AI to replicate her appearance and speech.
 She urged social media users, particularly the elderly, to be wary of such scams.
 “The use of other people’s images by AI to deceive the public is widespread, and I am among those whose image and voice have been exploited.
 “In my opinion, social media users need to be more aware because most of the targets are the elderly, who the scammers find are easily deceived.
 “Some use my voice and videos for contests, while others contact social media users and pretend to be me speaking to them,” she said when contacted.
 Siti Nurhaliza has asked the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to work with the public to address the issue and stop further harm.
 In July, the singer was reported saying a video call featuring herself, which turned out to be AI-generated, made its rounds on social media.
 Her likeness has also been used to promote products, such as bedsheets, on social media.
 She took to social media to warn her fans not to fall victim to such fraudulent schemes.
 Popular online cooking personality Khairul Aming was also not spared the danger of AI-generated content.
 Recently, an almost one-minute-­long video used Khairul Aming’s voice and likeness to persuade fans to purchase woks from him to help fund repairs for his warehouse.
 The online influencer highlighted the incident via his official TikTok page, warning his followers that his image had been manipulated to create such content.
 “I just want to remind you guys to be careful, as slanderous content has now become widespread and AI tools have been misused in so many ways.
 “You may see postings featuring someone’s likeness, but it is not actually them. So please be aware,” he said in a TikTok video.
 Khairul Aming also urged the public to keep themselves safe by verifying the information they consume online before making any purchases.
 In June, former shuttler Datuk Lee Chong Wei expressed his shock upon seeing a video showing an altered footage of himself promoting a “financial scheme”.
 “It’s crazy what the scammers are doing these days. 
 “I’m shocked to see this fake video of me promoting a certain financial programme,” Lee said in a Facebook post.
 Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil urged social media platforms to put an AI label or notification on all AI-generated content to prevent untoward incidents.

719254,Main,33,18/08/2024,San Francisco cracks down on AI nude generating websites,,"San Francisco: Nearly a year after AI-generated nude images of high school girls upended a community in southern Spain, a juvenile court this summer sentenced 15 of their classmates to a year of probation.
 But the artificial intelligence tool used to create the harmful deepfakes is still easily accessible on the internet, promising to “undress any photo” uploaded to the website within seconds.
 Now a new effort to shut down the app and others like it is being pursued in California, where San Francisco this week filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that experts say could set a precedent but will also face many hurdles.
 “The proliferation of these images has exploited a shocking number of women and girls across the globe,” said David Chiu, the elected city attorney of San Francisco who brought the case against a group of widely visited websites based in Estonia, Serbia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
 “These images are used to bully, humiliate and threaten women and girls,” he said. “And the impact on the victims has been devastating on their reputation, mental health, loss of autonomy, and in some instances, causing some to become suicidal.”
 The lawsuit brought on behalf of the people of California alleges that the services broke numerous state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. But it can be hard to determine who runs the apps, which are unavailable in phone app stores but still easily found on the internet.
 One service claimed by email that its “CEO is based and moves throughout the USA” but declined to provide any evidence or answer other questions.
 “There are a number of sites where we don’t know at this moment exactly who these operators are and where they’re operating from, but we have investigative tools and subpoena authority to dig into that,” Chiu said. “And we will certainly utilise our powers in the course of this litigation.” — AP",san francisco nude image school girl community southern spain juvenile court summer classmate artificial intelligence tool create harmful deepfakes accessible internet undress photo website effort app california san francisco week lawsuit expert precedent hurdle proliferation image woman girl globe david chiu city attorney san francisco website serbia united kingdom image threaten woman girl impact victim reputation mental health loss autonomy instance suicidal lawsuit behalf people alleges service numerous law fraudulent business practice nonconsensual pornography sexual abuse child hard determine unavailable phone app store service email ceo move provide evidence answer question moment operator investigative tool authority dig chiu utilise power litigation,"[(2, 0.99084204)]",2

 Aligned with Malaysia’s AI Talent Roadmap 2024-2030, the partnership aims to bolster the competencies of local talent through AI-enabling training and business services. 
 Under a memorandum of understanding dated July 18, the parties will work together in multiple areas, including joint training programmes and academic research to enhance skills in AI, data protection and governance. 
 This includes promoting knowledge sharing and opportunities for international certifications.
 Together, they will offer courses, workshops and forums designed  to raise awareness and impart skills  in generative AI, data protection,  and governance risk and  compliance. 
 To this end, AI tutors targeting  these areas will be developed and deployed to augment teachers’ capabilities, enhance the quality of education, and provide on-demand assistance for students and working adults. 
 Straits Interactive co-founder Alvin Toh said the collaboration is set to accelerate the country’s workforce transformation into a more tech-savvy and highly productive talent pool, fuelling AI adoption in organisations for economic growth. 
 With the combined training and technology, working professionals  with no prior knowledge of  generative AI or coding experience  will be able to build custom AI tools for various job functions and deploy them safely within organisational processes.

 He said the platform operators should be held responsible for incidents happening on their platforms.
 “If their content was produced using Generative AI technology, then it is only right for the platforms to put a label or notification with words like ‘generated by artificial intelligence’.
 “This is one of the reasons why we will eventually license all social media platforms ... because we want them to be responsible when there are incidents like this,” he said in reference to the incident involving social media influencer Khairul Aming who became a victim of a fake video made using deepfake technology, Bernama reported.
 Fahmi clarified that he had never issued a directive to Google to deactivate the ringgit currency exchange rate graph feature as claimed by a user on X.
 “I have never instructed Google to remove their foreign exchange tool or widget from their  platform. When we search on Google, we can still get foreign exchange information.
 “But we need to remember that there was an incident last month where there was an inaccurate ringgit exchange rate published by Google, which was different from what was published by Bank Negara,” he said.
 Recently, a post claiming that Fahmi had instructed Google to take down the foreign exchange widget triggered various reactions on X.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi said the Online Safety Bill was expected to be tabled in the coming Parliament meeting in October.
 He said the Bill was being refined by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, in collaboration with the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).
 He said the Bill aligned with the government’s intention to license social media platforms as part of efforts to address issues related to online platforms.
 “This matter (the Bill) is being discussed continuously, and we have a special committee involving several ministries ... we expect that at least an Online Safety Bill can be brought to Parliament soon.
 “We hope to table it in the coming Parliament sitting but as mentioned before, there are several matters we need to amend in existing laws such as the Penal Code,” he told reporters after officiating at the 2024 Huawei Malaysia Supplier Ecosystem Convention at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (MITEC) here yesterday.
 According to Fahmi, the Bill needed to be carefully refined to ensure the definition of offences provided in the new regulations were clear and specific.

717682,StarBiz,11,13/08/2024,Lenovo transforms traditional industries through AI and data,,"BEIJING: Sany Heavy Industry has integrated data from over 100 different applications into a centralised system, generating more than 1.2 trillion data points in the past year alone.
 This has led to a 30% increase in efficiency, a 50% lift in production capacity, a 60% reduction in labour utility and a 30% reduction in space usage, the Chinese heavy machinery maker said.
 Of course, behind these achievements is a partnership between Sany and Chinese tech company Lenovo that is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise industrial processes and resource management.
 This is part of Lenovo’s broader push to spearhead the integration of AI into traditional industries, significantly enhancing efficiency and productivity across sectors.
 Through its AI technologies and comprehensive solutions, Lenovo aims to pave the way for a new era of smart transformation.
 Liu Jun, executive vice-president of Lenovo Group and president of Lenovo China, said the company remains committed to its strategic vision of “Smarter AI for All”.“We want to harness the potential of AI to accelerate the smart transformation and upgrade of public organisations, large, small and medium enterprises and consumer clients,” Liu said.
 According to him, the company will collaborate with partners to advance China’s push to nurture new quality productive forces and contribute to the high-quality development of the Chinese economy.
 Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology, said previously that China’s traditional industries are vast and account for over 80% of the manufacturing sector. 
 These include steel, nonferrous metals, petrochemicals, building materials, light industry, machinery, textiles and apparel, foods and traditional Chinese medicine.
 These traditional sectors forming the foundation of the modern industrial system, are crucial for economic development and people’s livelihood, and are essential for maintaining China’s status as the world’s leading manufacturer, Jin said.
 “Regardless of the present or the future, traditional industries should not be simply labelled as ‘low-end industries’ and phased out. 
 “We must prioritise the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, employing a set of ‘comprehensive measures’ to accelerate their development toward higher-end, smarter and greener directions, allowing traditional industries to ‘blossom anew’,” Jin added.
 That is exactly what Lenovo aims to support.
 At Qingdao Special Iron and Steel Co Ltd, for instance, Lenovo’s self-developed Daystar AI vision inspection system has replaced workers who monitor production lines. 
 This system automatically identifies and alerts operational issues on the production line, providing high-quality monitoring and early warning capabilities without being affected by fatigue or emotional factors.Operating around the clock, the system ensures consistent and reliable supervision, highlighting the advantages of AI in maintaining quality control in manufacturing environments, Qingdao Special Iron and Steel said.
 Lenovo is also leveraging technology to help the academic sector boost its efficiency.At Nanjing University, Lenovo has established the second phase of the university’s high-performance computing centre. 
 Over the past six years, the system has operated with a stability rate above 99% and in the past three years, the utilisation rate of central processing units has exceeded 93%.
 This demonstrates the company’s capabilities in providing robust and efficient computing solutions for research and educational institutions, Lenovo said.
 These examples are part of Lenovo’s broader initiative to drive functional upgrades in traditional industries through AI and data technology.

715968,Main,12,09/08/2024,AI needed to solve AI-driven woes,"Incorporating new tech into data centre systems is vital, says industry player","KUALA LUMPUR: Learning how to adapt to and incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into data centre systems would be key to Malaysia meeting its aspiration of becoming a regional data centre hub, says an industry player.
 Leading critical digital infrastructure provider Vertiv is among the companies that are hoping to help in this regard by highlighting the impact AI can have on sustainable and responsible data centre operations.
 Vertiv Malaysia sales director Teoh Wooi Keat (pic) described AI as the “reinvention” of the Internet.
 “It will be akin to the ewallet revolution, which has taken the world by storm after it saw ­gradual widespread introduction across all sectors following the (Covid-19) pandemic,” he said during a presentation he made on AI’s impact on responsible data centre operations on Wednesday.
 Teoh said to keep up with this revolution, more efficient and accelerated IT architectures are needed for data centres to meet the requirements of AI workloads.
 “AI workloads will require complex calculations with billions of parameters leading to the need for more high-bandwidth memory (HBM) of up to 800Gbps (gigabits per second).
 “This is significantly higher compared with the conventional and currently widely-used Double Data Rate 5 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR5 SDRAM) with max speeds of 50Gbps that we have now.
 “Storage capacities will also need to be improved with current data created yearly already exceeding the 100-zettabyte mark and generative AI expected to further accelerate this trend.
 “Networking must also be accelerated as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Networking and AI accelerated instances run on network speeds of 1,600Gbps compared with the traditional instances of 1-10Gbps,” he added.
 A zettabyte is one trillion gigabytes.
 Teoh said with this sudden jump in requirements, AI was bringing in considerable uncertainty to once-proven infrastructure design practices for data centres.
 “Most database racks currently run loads of up to 20 kilowatts (kW) but 80% of IT managers have agreed that rack densities are going up as AI adoption changes the amount of computing power needed per rack.
 “In two years, racks are expected to run loads of 40kW and four years later, it may be common for all racks to run loads of up to 80kW, which increases energy usage and heat generated.
 “This sharp spike means simply beefing up existing cooling and energy supply solutions to meet the demands of AI workloads at data centres may no longer make economic sense.
 “Instead, accelerated AI thermal management solutions – which use precision air-conditioning combined with direct-to-chip and immersion cooling – will be the way forward to cool AI databases both effectively and efficiently,” he added.
 To this end, Teoh also presented what stakeholders need to consider when designing future AI-based data centres in the country.
 First is to design AI-based data centres’ power and cooling as a single system, with system-level controls to optimise performance and avoid inefficient use or underutilisation of resources in both areas.
 “By doing this, these infrastructures should also be designed to be able to handle highly dynamic workloads that are expected of AI-based systems, which can surge by as much as 150%.
 “These systems should also be designed for modularity and scalability that enable accelerated future design deployment, making them future-ready to support potential growth of up to 500kW per database rack,” he added.
 With this in mind, Teoh said Vertiv is working closely with technology giants Nvidia and Intel to develop power and cooling infrastructure to support their latest, highest-grade AI solutions.
 “With Nvidia, the team came up with a novel approach combining two data centre liquid cooling technologies into a single system that has never been seen before.
 “Entire servers, with their lower power components, were encased in hermetically-sealed containers and immersed in coolant.
 “With Intel, its Gaudi3 AI accelerator was designed to enable both liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers, supported by Vertiv-pumped two-phase (P2P) cooling infrastructure, that recycles coolant,” he added.",kuala lumpur adapt incorporate artificial intelligence data centre system key malaysia meeting aspiration regional data centre hub industry player critical digital infrastructure provider vertiv company regard impact sustainable responsible data centre operation malaysia sale director wooi keat pic reinvention internet akin ewallet revolution storm gradual widespread introduction sector pandemic presentation impact responsible data centre operation teoh revolution efficient architecture data centre meet requirement workload workload complex calculation billion parameter bandwidth memory hbm gbps gigabit conventional double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory ddr sdram max speed gbps storage capacity current data zettabyte mark generative accelerate trend networking oracle cloud infrastructure instance network speed gbps traditional instance zettabyte gigabyte teoh sudden jump requirement considerable uncertainty proven infrastructure design practice centre rack kilowatt manager rack density adoption amount power rack rack load common rack increase energy usage heat sharp spike energy supply solution demand workload data centre economic sense thermal management solution air conditioning direct chip immersion cool database teoh stakeholder future data centre country design data centre power single system system level control performance avoid inefficient underutilisation resource infrastructure handle dynamic workload system surge system modularity scalability enable accelerated future design deployment future ready support potential growth database rack mind teoh vertiv technology giant intel power infrastructure support solution team approach data centre liquid technology single system entire server lower power component container coolant intel gaudi accelerator enable liquid air server vertiv phase infrastructure recycles,"[(0, 0.083730824), (4, 0.69906116), (5, 0.21469054)]",4
716016,Main,23,09/08/2024,AI-generated articles land leading Aussie magazine  in hot water,,"Sydney: One of Australia’s leading science magazines drew fire after publishing AI-generated articles that experts said were incorrect or oversimplified.
 Cosmos, published by Aust­ralia’s state-backed national science agency, used Open AI’s GPT-4 to produce six articles published last month.
 Although the use of artificial intelligence was disclosed, the Science Journalists Association of Australia said its use had caused serious concerns.
 Association president Jackson Ryan said that in the AI-generated Cosmos article ‘What happens  to our bodies after death?’, the descriptions of scientific processes were incorrect or vastly simplified.
 In one example, the AI service wrote that rigor mortis sets in 3 to 4 hours after death. 
 Ryan said scientific research shows the timing to be less definitive.
 Another example included the description of autolysis – a process in which cells are destroyed by their enzymes – which the article described as “self-breaking”.
 Ryan said this was a poor description of the process.
 He said generally, these inaccuracies would damage people’s trust in and perception of the publication.
 A spokesperson for the national science agency said that the AI content had been fact-checked by a “trained science communicator and edited by the Cosmos publishing team”.
 Cosmos would continue to review the use of the AI service throughout the experiment, the spokesperson added.
 The magazine has drawn further criticism for using a journalism grant to develop its artificial intelligence capabilities, which could come at the expense of journalists.
 Cosmos’ former editor Gail MacCallum told Australia’s national broadcaster ABC that while she was a “huge proponent of exploring AI”, having it create articles was “past my comfort zone”.
 Another former editor of Cosmos, Ian Connellan, told the ABC he had not been informed  of the AI project and, if he had, he’d have advised it was a “bad idea”.
 The use of AI is becoming a major battleground for publishers and musicians.
 The New York Times recently sued ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft in a US court, alleging that the companies’ powerful AI models used millions of articles for training without permission from its authors.

 The research house continued to favour Axiata for its growth prospects for telecommunication companies (telcos) and tower assets in emerging markets, as well as strong asset monetisation prospects for telecommunications tower company Edotco Group and its digital businesses.
 The telco will be able to better capitalise its growth prospects, given that it plans to deleverage and strengthen its balance sheet.
 As such, the research house has maintained its “outperform” call and sum-of-parts target price of RM3 for the stock.
 Risks to its call include a strong US dollar as this may weigh on the performance of its telcos in frontier markets such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.
 The research house added that gestational earnings and cash flow drag from Indonesian unit PT Link Net Tbk’s aggressive expansion and capital expenditure up-cycle due to the looming implementation of 5G in Indonesia could also affect its call.
 “We came away from Axiata’s IDEAS@ Axiata 2024 forum earlier this week with a neutral perspective, as it is still early to gauge the full impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
 “In the future, Axiata may deploy customer service AI agents capable of human-like interactions with its customers.
 “Additionally, we believe CelcomDigi Bhd may market customised AI models and applications to Malaysian enterprises via its partnerships with global cloud providers,” it added.
 The research house said enterprises and organisations can build and deploy customised AI models by integrating their respective data lakes with foundation models from various AI providers as a starting base.
 “These customised models undergo fine-tuning and may use retrieval augmented generation to enhance the accuracy and relevance of outputs.
 “Axiata is optimistic about leveraging AI to develop customer service chatbots capable of human-like interactions for both its telcos and Axiata Digital Analytics customers,” Kenanga Research said.

714625,Main,24,06/08/2024,AI lies flooding feeds,Deluge of fakery raises voter manipulation fears in the US,"Washington: A “deepfake” video parodying Kamala Harris, a manipulated expletive-laden clip of Joe Biden and a doctored image of Donald Trump being arrested – a tide of AI-fuelled political disinformation has prompted alarm over its potential to manipulate voters as the US presidential race heats up.
 In what is widely billed as America’s first AI election in November, researchers warn that tech-enabled fakery could be used to steer voters toward or away from candidates – or even to avoid the polls altogether – ­stoking tensions in an already hyperpolarised environment.
 A recent wave of disinformation has renewed calls for tech giants – many of which have retreated from moderating social media content – to strengthen guardrails around generative artificial intelligence ahead of the vote.
 Last week, Elon Musk faced intense criticism for sharing a deepfake video featuring Vice President Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with his 192 million followers on X.
 In it, a voiceover mimicking Harris calls President Joe Biden senile; the voice then declares that she does not “know the first thing about running the country”.
 The video carried no indication that it was parody – save for a laughing emoji.
 Only later did Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire.
 Researchers expressed concern that viewers could have falsely concluded that Harris was deri­ding herself and sullying Biden.
 Last month, a manipulated video ricocheting across X appeared to show Biden cursing his critics – including using anti-LGBTQ slurs – after he announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination.
 A reverse image search showed the footage came from one of Biden’s speeches, carried live by the broadcaster PBS, in which he denounced political violence after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump.
 Weeks earlier, an image shared across platforms appeared to show police forcibly arresting Trump after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
 But the photo was a deepfake, digital forensics experts said.
 “These recent examples are highly representative of how deepfakes will be used in politics going forward,” said Lucas Hansen, co-founder of CivAI.
 “While AI-powered disinformation is certainly a concern, the most likely applications will be manufactured images and videos intended to provoke anger and worsen partisan tension.”
 Observers warn that such fake­ry on a mass scale risks igniting public anger at the electoral process. More than 50% of Americans expect AI-enabled falsehoods to impact who wins the 2024 election, according to a poll published last year by Axios and Morning Consult. — AFP",washington deepfake video kamala harris expletive laden clip joe biden image donald trump tide political disinformation alarm potential manipulate voter presidential race heat america election november researcher tech steer voter candidate poll tension environment wave disinformation tech giant social medium content strengthen guardrail generative artificial intelligence vote week elon musk intense criticism deepfake video vice president presumptive democratic nominee follower harris call president joe biden senile voice declares country video indication parody emoji musk clarify video satire researcher concern viewer harris deri biden month video ricocheting biden cursing critic anti lgbtq slur seek reelection democratic nomination reverse image search footage biden speech live broadcaster pb political violence july assassination attempt trump week image platform police trump york jury guilty falsifying business record money payment star stormy daniel deepfake digital forensics expert example representative deepfakes politics hansen founder civai disinformation concern application image video anger partisan tension observer fake mass scale risk public electoral process american falsehood impact win election poll axios morning consult afp,"[(0, 0.5933233), (6, 0.40215826)]",0
713931,Lifestyle,5,05/08/2024,The fussabout AI,The explosion of  artificial intelligence  in the years following  the launch of ChatGPT has not been free of controversy.,"WITH the jury still out on whether ­artificial intelligence (AI) has been a net positive or loss for humanity, there’s been a host of debates surrounding the technology alongside its rapid development and ­adoption.In the EU, for instance, companies are running into regulatory roadblocks over their non-compliance with data privacy regulations in the region.
 Meta announced back in June that it would be incorporating European users’ social media posts into its AI training data for the Llama AI model. With Llama being a multimodal AI, this would include everything from text and images to video and audio.
 Soon after, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) requested that the social media giant refrain from utilising the region’s social media content to train large language models, prompting Meta to delay its AI launch in the EU to the joy of other European regulators.
 Users in the UK and EU have the “right to object”, which would effectively opt them out from having their data used by Meta in training its AI model. However, the process has been described as tedious and awkward.Meanwhile, those in other regions ­without data protection regulations as stringent as the GDPR do not have this option, according to a report from online tech publication Mashable.
 X (formerly Twitter) made a similar move to utilise user posts in training its Grok AI model at the end of July, prompting the DPC and the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office to question the ­platform over the data harvesting.
 The Elon Musk-owned platform had users opt-in by default to allow for AI training on their data, which goes against the UK’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) according to a report from The Guardian.Under UK’s GDPR, companies are not allowed to implement consent by default, which is the case in X’s settings page.Mired in ­controversy
 Reports over the contents of training data fed into AI models have also been extensive, covering ­allegations of stolen and illicit content.
 Back in December last year, researchers from the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the Laion-5B dataset contained 1,679 illegal images consisting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) scraped from social media posts and ­popular adult websites.This dataset was used to train the popular AI image generator Stable Diffusion.
 Further discussion over the datasets in AI training involves where the content is sourced from. Nonprofit EleutherAI compiled a massive dataset named “The Pile” which was reported in July to contain the captions of over 170,000 YouTube videos.
 These captions were taken without ­permission and allegedly used by major companies like Anthropic, Nvidia, and Salesforce.
 Initial reports had listed Apple as having used this stolen data in AI training, but the company has since refuted such claims.Content from influencers such as MrBeast, PewDiePie, Marques Brownlee and Jacksepticeye were included in the dataset, alongside various talk shows and news outlets such as Wall Street Journal, NPR, and the BBC.
 Brownlee’s videos were also allegedly subject to further use as training data for an AI video generation tool developed by Runway without consent, according to reports in late July. Reports say that 1,709 videos of his videos were used for AI training.Claims of outright copyright violation have also been the subject of legal battles in the AI space, with a coalition of music companies including Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records alleging that AI music generation companies Udio and Suno infringed on their copyright.The lawsuit claims that the AI firms trained their music-generation models using copyrighted materials owned by the music labels, seeking US$150,000 (RM674,805) in damages per song used in training.A similar lawsuit was also launched by the New York Times in the case of journalistic content against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (and its owner Microsoft) last December and is currently ongoing. 
 Claims from the New York Times allege that copyrighted content from the American newspaper had been unlawfully used in developing artificial intelligence products that “threatens the Times’ ability to provide that service”.
 Both OpenAI and Microsoft have shot back that its products do not serve as a ­substitute for the reporting offered by the publication, requesting courts to dismiss the lawsuit.
 Other news providers such as the Associated Press, Axel Springer, FT Group, News Corp, and Vox Media have reached licensing deals with OpenAI, allowing their content to be used in the training of the company’s large language models (LLMs).
 More direct claims of plagiarism came from magazines Forbes and Wired in June, with accusations that AI search and ­chatbot startup Perplexity had been scraping ­content from the magazines’ respective websites.
 Forbes claimed that Perplexity had ­utilised AI to generate an article, podcast, and YouTube video based on a story that the publication put up on its website. This was done without permission from and attributing credit to Forbes for the original report.
 The publication further alleged to have found other plagiarised stories republished by Perplexity with uncited information sourced from Bloomberg and CNBC.
 Wired on the other hand claimed that Perplexity had been ignoring “robots.txt”, a file used in the Robots Exclusion Protocol intended to disallow web scrapers and crawlers, which the AI company said it honoured.
 In a report, the tech magazine claims that it monitored network traffic to its ­website and linked it to bots associated with Perplexity, following a prompt about an article published on its site.
 It further drew a ­comparison to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, which offered a hypothesis about the story in question, but explicitly stated that they did not have access to it.
 On July 30, the startup reached an agreement with several outlets including Time, Fortune, and Wordpress on a revenue-­sharing programme that would pay the publications for articles cited in AI-generated responses.",jury artificial intelligence net positive loss humanity host debate technology rapid development adoption instance company regulatory roadblock compliance data privacy regulation region meta june european user social medium post data llama model llama multimodal text image audio irish data protection commission dpc social medium giant utilising region social medium content train language model meta delay launch joy european regulator user data meta model process tedious awkward region protection regulation gdpr option report online tech publication mashable twitter move user post grok model july dpc commissioner office question platform data elon musk platform user default data data protection regulation report guardian gdpr company implement consent default setting controversy report content data model allegation illicit content december researcher internet observatory laion dataset illegal image child sexual abuse material csam social medium post popular adult website train popular image generator stable diffusion discussion datasets involves content nonprofit eleutherai massive dataset pile july caption video caption permission major company salesforce initial report apple data company claim content influencers pewdiepie marque jacksepticeye news outlet street journal npr bbc brownlee video subject training data video generation tool runway consent report late july report video claim copyright violation subject legal battle space coalition music company universal music sony music warner record music generation company copyright lawsuit firm music generation model material music label damage lawsuit york time journalistic content chatgpt maker openai owner microsoft december claim york time content american newspaper artificial intelligence product time ability service openai microsoft shot product substitute reporting publication court dismiss lawsuit news provider springer news corp vox medium deal content training company language model direct claim plagiarism magazine forbes june accusation search chatbot startup perplexity content magazine respective website forbes perplexity utilised generate article podcast youtube video story publication website permission credit forbes original report publication plagiarised story perplexity bloomberg cnbc hand perplexity robot file robot exclusion protocol disallow web scraper crawler company report tech magazine claim network traffic website bot perplexity prompt article site comparison openai chatgpt anthropic claude hypothesis story question access july startup agreement outlet time fortune wordpress revenue programme pay publication article response,"[(0, 0.046341714), (2, 0.9515257)]",2
713615,StarEdu,8,04/08/2024,Are we ready for AI in healthcare?,"Education for pharmacists must incorporate AI, data ethics and cybersecurity","Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising healthcare across multiple domains, from diagnosis to treatment.
 AI-powered devices and sensors can track patients’ health in real time, helping them stay on top of their medication and making healthcare more accessible, especially in remote areas.
 AI can also help develop new medicines by predicting drug efficacy and interactions. This makes the development process safer, faster and more efficient. 
 By taking over routine, non-clinical tasks, AI allows pharmacists to focus on what they do best – addressing patient-specific needs.
 However, for AI to be effective, it is crucial that the data it is based on is accurate and reliable. Without proper data preparation, AI recommendations can be flawed, leading to errors and inaccuracies.
 By investing in data quality initiatives, Malaysia can position itself at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
 High-quality data is essential for AI technologies to work accurately and reliably, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare.
 The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of being prepared for epidemics. AI can play a critical role in this by analysing patient data and environmental factors to predict disease outbreaks.
 It can also improve access to essential medicines and vaccines, and help distribute medical supplies more effectively.
 With AI, we can respond faster and more effectively to future health crises. While AI has many capabilities, these machines cannot replicate the judgement, empathy and expertise of a human pharmacist.
 Humans have a unique ability to observe and understand patient behaviour, and to empathise with them in a way that machines cannot. These observations are crucial in patient care.
 The growing amount of sensitive patient data, however, requires strong data privacy and cybersecurity measures to be in place. Most healthcare organisations are not equipped to handle such large amounts of data, making them vulnerable to data breaches.
 If we are not prepared, data breaches can have serious consequences, damaging our reputation and finances. With the rise of ransomware and cyberattacks, we need strict regulations to protect patient data. The question is: Are we ready to handle this challenge? Should companies be held accountable for protecting patient data, and face consequences if they fail?
 AI operates in a regulatory grey area, and its safety and robustness in healthcare models are often overlooked. This raises ethical concerns, particularly when AI-generated decisions conflict with patient preferences.
 The issue of malpractice is especially contentious, with debates over who is liable for life-threatening mistakes made by AI.
 Organisations also struggle with trusting AI decision-making tools, as over-reliance on AI recommendations can erode the critical thinking and judgement of healthcare professionals. Moreover, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased, the AI model will be too.
 This raises important questions about accountability: How can we ensure that healthcare providers are responsible for their AI models and the data they use? And who is liable when AI-driven decisions lead to negative consequences?
 The future of healthcare lies in education that combines human expertise with AI. As patient care becomes increasingly reliant on AI, pharmacists are more crucial than ever for their human insight and oversight.
 To succeed, pharmacists must be AI-aware, and this requires education that incorporates AI fundamentals, data ethics and cybersecurity.

713039,StarBiz,2,02/08/2024,Pentamaster optimistic about the expanding role of AI,,"PETALING JAYA: Pentamaster Corp Bhd continues to identify growth drivers such as artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, automotive electrification, and medical automation to drive its business momentum forward.
 The company is particularly optimistic about the expanding role of AI in cloud and data centres as this trend is expected to create significant opportunities for the demand of the group’s test equipment used in advanced semiconductor packaging.
 “The increasing adoption of silicon carbide-based power solutions across various applications, particularly in data centres and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chipset is gaining momentum,” Pentamaster said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
 The trend is expected to generate an uptick in demand for the group’s wafer-level burn-in tester for silicon carbide, besides test handler solutions for advanced semiconductor packaging in dynamic random access memory as well as HBM.
 “The global semiconductor industry is demonstrating its strong fundamentals and growth potential supporting the diverse range of disruptive applications emerging from the AI wave.
 “As forecast, the semiconductor test equipment are projected to rise 7.4% in 2024, while assembly and packaging equipment sales are predicted to increase 10% for the same period, and this momentum shall continue into 2025 due to increased demand for advanced logic and memory applications,” Pentamaster stated in its filing.
 Despite market fluctuations and industry challenges, Pentamaster recognised the strong foundation of the electric vehicle (EV) market, supported by regulations, expanding charging infrastructure, industry investments, and growing consumer demand for affordable, eco-friendly options.
 “These ongoing developments are expected to sustain a considerable amount of business opportunities for the group to navigate uncertainties and capitalise on emerging prospects,” it said.
 Meanwhile, for the second quarter ended June 30 (2Q24), Pentamaster’s net profit fell 15.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM19.9mil or earnings per share (EPS) of 2.8 sen as revenue fell by 3% to RM171.4mil.
 The drop in topline number was due to a drop in its automated test equipment (ATE) segment while earnings were hit by lower ATE sales volume, increased employee expenses, provisions for slow-moving inventories and research and development expenditures for certain projects undertaken in the ATE segment. 
 The fall in profit was cushioned by the strong growth in its factory automation solutions (FAS) segment, its filing noted.
 Pentamsater’s revenue was mainly contributed by the ATE and FAS segments, constituting 40.7% and 59.3% respectively in 2Q24. 
 For the first half, it posted a 13% y-o-y lower net profit of RM39.3mil or EPS of 5.52 sen while revenue was flat at RM342.16mil y-o-y.
 Pentamaster said although the group expects a challenging business environment in the second half of the year, it remains steadfast in its commitment to demonstrating resilience and agility in navigating this complex landscape.
 “The group’s primary focus is to ensure its core businesses remain robust and adaptable in the face of these challenges while continuing to pursue business diversification to explore new opportunities within its established markets. 
 “Through these comprehensive efforts, the group is determined to sustain growth and maintain stability to weather the challenging conditions ahead,” it said.",jaya pentamaster corp bhd growth driver artificial intelligence advancement automotive electrification medical automation drive business momentum company optimistic role cloud data centre trend create opportunity test equipment semiconductor packaging adoption silicon carbide power solution application data centre bandwidth memory hbm chipset momentum pentamaster bursa malaysia trend generate uptick demand level tester silicon carbide test handler solution semiconductor packaging dynamic random access memory hbm global semiconductor industry strong fundamental growth potential diverse range disruptive application semiconductor test equipment rise assembly packaging equipment sale increase period momentum demand logic memory application market fluctuation industry strong foundation electric vehicle market regulation infrastructure industry investment consumer demand affordable eco friendly option development considerable amount business opportunity uncertainty prospect quarter pentamaster net profit mil earnings share sen revenue drop topline drop test equipment ate segment earnings lower ate sale volume employee expense provision inventory development project undertaken ate segment fall profit strong growth factory automation solution segment filing pentamsater revenue ate fa segment half lower net profit mil sen revenue flat mil pentamaster business environment half steadfast commitment resilience agility complex landscape primary focus core business robust adaptable challenge pursue business diversification explore opportunity market comprehensive effort sustain growth stability weather condition,"[(0, 0.99527174)]",0
712601,StarMetro,3,01/08/2024,‘Expand AI cameras to other local councils’,,"THE installation of artificial intelligence (AI) closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) should be expanded to include other local authorities in Johor as it can provide better security coverage for all.
 Applauding the state government for incorporating the latest technology to address public safety concerns, Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation (MCPF) Johor chapter chairman Datuk Tee Siew Kiong said  using AI technology in various fields including security was a global trend.
 “It is good that Johor government is proactive in this. 
 “Addressing security concerns can help Johor attract more investments into the state, as foreign investors always highlight safety before making a decision to invest,” he told StarMetro.
 Tee added that this was vital in the state government’s plan to make Johor a developed state by 2030.
 Among key steps to achieve this was the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), while the movement of travellers between Johor and Singapore would surely increase with the Rapid Transit System Link (RTS) being operational by 2027, he said.
 “Both the JS-SEZ and RTS will bring in more investments into the state. By having the AI CCTV in place, it will surely ease safety concerns among investors.
 “It will definitely help change any negative perception of Johor Baru as the state government is taking positive steps through the AI CCTV,” he added.
 Tee said the four local councils and police could work closely through the smart intelligence operation centres (SIOC).
 “I believe criminals will have to think twice before committing a crime as their act would be caught on camera.”
 Tee said with AI technology, local councils would not need a lot of manpower on duty at their respective SIOC.
 “That extra manpower can be sent to other departments and the local councils can focus on other services that can improve the people’s well-being.”
 Tee, however, urged the  state government to widen  the coverage of AI CCTV to  other locations outside Greater Johor Baru.
 He said many countries had adopted AI technology as part of their safety features.
 “For example, all the major cities in China have already installed AI CCTV that help the authorities keep a close watch on things.
 “Once the AI CCTV is proven to be a helpful tool in fighting crime, it should be installed at other districts in Johor.”
 Tee urged other local councils to also instal such cameras in areas under their jurisdiction. 
 Fighting crime, he said, should not fall on the shoulders of the authorities alone and called on the public to be more proactive.
 “Everyone should play a bigger role in helping the authorities fight crime including preventing it.
 “People nowadays have smartphones at their disposal and they should immediately contact the police by giving  out important and valuable information. 
 “If they see a crime happening in front of their eyes, they should record it on their mobile phones and give the recording to the police,” he said. — By MOHD FARHAAN SHAH",installation artificial intelligence circuit television camera expanded local authority provide security coverage government technology address public safety concern malaysian crime prevention foundation mcpf johor chapter chairman tee siew kiong technology field security global trend johor government proactive security concern johor attract investment foreign investor safety decision starmetro tee vital government plan johor key step johor singapore special economic zone sez movement traveller surely increase rapid transit system link operational sez rts investment cctv ease safety concern investor negative perception johor baru government positive step cctv tee local council police smart intelligence operation centre criminal crime caught camera tee technology local council lot manpower duty respective sioc extra manpower department local council focus service people urged government widen coverage cctv location johor baru country technology safety feature major city cctv authority cctv helpful tool crime installed district johor tee local council instal camera jurisdiction crime fall shoulder authority public proactive play bigger role authority crime people nowadays smartphones contact police valuable crime front eye record mobile phone police mohd farhaan shah,"[(2, 0.66873664), (3, 0.3267766)]",2
712337,StarBiz,8,31/07/2024,Tech titan bets big  with ambitious AI vision,Kasikorn group unveils inclusive plans for technology,"BANGKOK: Group chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), Ruangroj Poonpol, delivered a powerful speech at the second annual KBTG Techtopia, Thailand’s largest technology conference, outlining the company’s aggressive vision and commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) development.
 This year’s event, themed “A Blast From the Future”, delved into the likely future with over 50 leading experts from Thailand and abroad sharing their insights on AI and game-changing technologies.
 The event also showcased several cutting-edge use cases from KBTG (THaLLE, Finly, FinLearn, Luna and Future you), allowing participants to envision the immense potential of the next wave of AI and other technologies.
 This year’s conference was made even more special by the appearance of Dr Andrew Ng, one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential figures in the AI world. He presented his insights in a talk titled “The Opportunities and sisks of AI”.
 The speech focused on AI risks and opportunities, future AI development trends, and strategies for launching successful startups and fostering growth in Thailand. 
 Underscoring KBTG’s commitment to going “all-in” on democratising AI technology under the banner “AI for all”, Ruangroj, also known as Krating, announced the signing of two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with Ng’s AI Fund and DeepLearning.AI. 
 The collaboration aims to accelerate AI adoption in Thailand by unlocking the synergy between powerful AI tools and empowering Thais to leverage AI effectively.
 The two MoUs aim to form a partnership to drive AI education in Thailand.
 The first is a collaboration between KBTG, DeepLearning.Ai, and AIAT to develop the KBTG.AI Kampus programme, which will support the Super AI Engineer Bootcamp. 
 The programme not only provides experts, tools, and training courses to incubate super AI engineers, but also provides AI curriculum support and consultation to Thai universities and government agencies.
 Founded by Ng, DeepLearning.AI provides essential online courses, knowledge, and tools to help people understand AI fundamentals and improve their AI skills and productivity.
 The second MoU focuses on a partnership between KBTG, AI Fund, and the Equitable Education Fund (EEF) to develop an AI assistant specifically designed for youth education. 
 The collaborative effort aims to explore the co-creation of AI solutions alongside all three parties to address the challenges of mental health and educational equity in Thailand.
 Sharing a common passion for AI and education, KBank and KBTG have partnered to ensure that the collaboration benefits not only themselves but also Thailand’s entire AI ecosystem, fostering growth in both the education and startup sectors and propelling the country towards becoming a global leader in AI technology.
 Prior to the event, KXVC, the venture capital arm of KBTG, announced its new strategic partnership aimed at growing and scaling new AI companies and startups in Thailand. 
 Committed partner
 By combining AI Fund’s venture studio model with KBTG’s cutting-edge technological expertise – a powerful force in South-East Asia’s tech scene – the  partnership aims to tackle real-world challenges through innovative new solutions. AI Fund and KXVC will join forces to build new companies and forge stronger connections within their ecosystems.
 While AI isn’t a new concept, Ruangroj argues that we are currently experiencing a peak in its transformative power. Advancements in areas like generative AI, computer vision with large language models, and composite AI all point towards this.
 The surge in capability is leading to a wave of enthusiasm for AI adoption, with both individuals and businesses eager to leverage its potential. 
 Speaking on stage at the KBTG Techtopia event on the topic “Transform to Thrive in the Age of AI”, he forecast that by 2030, domain-specific AI or vertical AI will dominate every industry. 
 He said domain-specific AI would equip businesses with deep knowledge of their specific field, allowing them to address unique challenges. 
 The approach offers advantages like tackling specific needs and meeting domain-specific challenges more effectively with less cost and resources. 
 Furthermore, vertical AI often utilises a “multimodal” approach, meaning it can work with various data types for a more comprehensive understanding. 
 In some cases, it can even involve “multi-agent systems”, where multiple AI programs collaborate on complex tasks. The collaborative approach further enhances vertical AI’s problem-solving capabilities.
 While encouraging everyone and every business to engage AI as a companion and to embrace changes with an open mind, as demonstrated at KBTG, which has always been a pioneer in AI, he advised patience, curiosity and responsibility. 
 KBTG’s core transformation concept, “Human First, AI First”, exemplifies this approach. Ruangroj explained that the company prioritises humans as the centre for unlocking business and customer impact. By 2027, they aim to achieve this through AI-powered revenue generation, product innovation, and productivity improvements.
 However, KBTG’s ambitions extend beyond the company itself.
 Ruangroj emphasised their commitment to an “all-in” strategy, aiming to bring all Thais on board to benefit from AI technology. He cited the two MoUs KBTG had signed with AI Fund as evidence of its dedication to Thailand.
 AI Fund footprint
 Emphasising his firm belief in Thailand’s potential, Andrew Ng, a prominent figure in AI and managing general partner of AI Fund, praised the country as a top destination for the AI industry in the Asean region. 
 Ng’s visit aimed to explore opportunities for AI Fund to contribute to Thailand’s AI development through strategic partnerships. 
 He stated that technology is an essential foundation for all types of businesses. AI and smart technology are applicable to both small and medium businesses and large corporations.
 He expressed an interest in sharing his expertise in AI training to strengthen the Thai workforce and improve education quality in AI fields, which aligns with the “Ignite Thailand” vision of becoming a digital-economy hub.
 This reflected his intention to collaborate with KBTG and KXVC to improve AI education in Thailand while also exploring potential partnerships with Thai businesses and entrepreneurs. 
 To demonstrate his commitment, he held meetings with Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, the Minister Education, the Minister Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation,  and other senior officials. — The Nation/ANN",bangkok chairman business technology kbtg ruangroj poonpol powerful speech annual kbtg techtopia largest technology conference company aggressive vision commitment artificial intelligence development event blast future future expert insight game technology event edge thalle finlearn luna future participant envision potential wave technology conference special appearance time magazine influential figure insight talk opportunity speech risk opportunity development trend strategy successful startup growth thailand kbtg commitment technology banner ruangroj krating memorandum mous fund deeplearning collaboration aim adoption thailand synergy powerful tool thai leverage mous aim form partnership drive education thailand collaboration aiat kbtg kampus programme support super engineer bootcamp programme expert training course super engineer curriculum support consultation thai university government agency essential online course tool people fundamental skill productivity mou partnership kbtg fund equitable education fund eef assistant education collaborative effort aim creation solution party address challenge health educational equity thailand common passion education kbtg partnered collaboration benefit entire ecosystem growth education startup sector country global leader technology prior event kxvc venture capital arm kbtg strategic partnership company partner fund venture studio model edge technological expertise powerful force south east asia tech scene partnership tackle real challenge innovative solution fund kxvc join force company stronger connection concept ruangroj transformative power advancement generative computer vision language model surge capability enthusiasm adoption individual business eager leverage potential speaking stage techtopia event topic transform thrive age forecast domain specific vertical dominate industry domain specific equip business knowledge specific field address unique challenge offer advantage specific meeting domain specific cost resource vertical utilises approach meaning data type comprehensive understanding involve multi agent system multiple program complex task collaborative approach vertical capability business engage companion embrace mind kbtg pioneer patience curiosity responsibility kbtg core transformation concept human exemplifies ruangroj company prioritises human business customer impact aim revenue generation product innovation productivity improvement ambition company ruangroj commitment strategy thai board benefit technology mous kbtg fund evidence dedication thailand fund footprint firm belief potential andrew prominent figure partner fund country top destination industry asean region visit opportunity fund contribute thailand development strategic partnership technology essential foundation type business smart technology applicable medium business corporation expertise training strengthen thai workforce education quality field aligns ignite thailand vision digital economy hub intention collaborate kbtg kxvc education thailand potential partnership business demonstrate commitment meeting prime minister srettha thavisin minister education minister education science innovation senior official nation,"[(1, 0.9976974)]",1
712329,StarBiz,9,31/07/2024,Boost in trading as brokers leverage AI to help investors,,"SINGAPORE: Stock brokerages are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to pick and analyse stocks in an attempt to draw tech-native young investors. 
 While doing so, they find they have an audience among more seasoned users as well.
 One of those leading the charge is OCBC Securities, which in June launched AI Oscar, short for AI OCBC Securities’ Customer Artificial Intelligence Radar.
 The stock-picking tool uses deep-learning to identify and predict stock price movements, unlike other AI programs that make decisions based on a set of pre-determined criteria, said OCBC Securities managing director Wilson He.
 Deep learning is the process where artificial neural networks – algorithms that mimic the way the human brain works – process data from multiple sources and analyse the information in real time.
 Other online trading platforms are also using predictive analytics to help forecast market trends and identify stock picks for customers.
 All the brokerages have developed some form of educational content for investors to help them comprehend difficult financial concepts.
 Tiger Brokers integrated these capabilities with TigerGPT, an AI-powered chatbot in the Tiger Trade app.
 Its market strategist James Ooi said this makes it easier for a Tiger user to read up on information related to the stocks he is interested in, the companies’ financial numbers and trending market topics. The chatbot also answers any queries that investors have.
 As for FSMOne.com, its general manager Joshua Chim said the online investment platform has a stock/exchange-traded fund selector function, which helps to filter choices based on criteria like desired investment themes. 
 This narrows down the selection process – from the whole universe of Singapore Exchange-listed stocks to a certain number of companies, for example.
 OCBC Securities said AI Oscar takes stock-picking and analysis to the next level as it learns from an investor’s behaviour, his trading patterns, his risk appetite and his past trading activity.
 It then comes up with a personalised report of 15 different stock ideas for each customer every week – five each for Singapore, Hong Kong and United States – the three most popular markets among Singapore investors.
 He of OCBC Securities added that each stock recommendation comes with a research report, price and company-specific information.
 Jayzee Poh, 32, who has been investing in the markets for the past nine years, said he started using AI Oscar two months ago to supplement his decision-making.

712497,Main,21,31/07/2024,The other side of the AI coin,Cybersecurity fears over rogue versions of tools being sold on the Dark Web,"As students and workers harness generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for their studies and work, so, too, have crooks.Underground forums are selling modified versions of ChatGPT that circumvent safety filters to generate scam content, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said in its Singapore Cyber Landscape report for 2023, published yesterday.
 FraudGPT and WormGPT, two modified versions of OpenAI’s chatbot, have been reportedly sold to more than 3,000 customers globally since July 2023, raising fears that generative AI could herald a wave of cyber attacks, scams and falsehoods.
 FraudGPT is marketed on the Dark Web as a tool to learn how  to hack, and write malware and malicious code. 
 WormGPT was developed to circumvent ChatGPT’s guard rails, such as prohibition against the generation of phishing e-mails or writing malware code.
 Roughly 13% of phishing scams in 2023 analysed by CSA showed signs that they were likely made with AI.
 Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT launch in late 2022, cybersecurity firms have reported a growing trend of hackers using the AI tool to gather critical details about software to find vulnerabilities in companies’ systems that can be exploited.
 Microsoft, for example, disclosed that bad actors had used  AI to study technical protocols for military-related equipment such as radars and satellites, illustrating how AI can be used in reconnaissance before an attack is staged.
 Cracked chatbots continue to emerge despite efforts to clamp down on them. The Telegram channel promoting WormGPT was shut down, only for other similar tools to appear elsewhere.
 AI-powered password generators like PassGAN, which can be deployed at scale, can also crack more than half of common passwords in under a minute.
 Another way the technology is deployed maliciously is in the generation of deepfake images to bypass biometric authentication. 
 For example, to beat the use of facial recognition as a security feature, fraudsters turn to face- swapping apps.
 There is a growing underground market of criminal developers peddling impersonation services that employ deepfakes, fake social media accounts and AI-generated spam content that can bypass anti-phishing controls of popular e-mail services, and can be used to deploy scam campaigns, said CSA. 
 Despite concerns about AI, the very same technology is being used by the cyber security sector to combat scams.
 “Through machine learning and algorithms, AI can be trained to detect deepfakes, phishing e-mails and suspicious activities,” said CSA.
 Algorithms can be trained to spot unnatural facial movements, lighting discrepancies and irregularities in eye reflections, which are all tell-tale signs of deepfakes, said CSA.
 But developers face challenges in using AI for cyber security, such as false positives, false negatives, and an arms race against cyber criminals that may be unsustainable in the long run for many organisations.
 “As law enforcement (agencies train) their AI systems, cyber criminals can also actively develop methods to evade and fool AI detection systems,” CSA said. 
 “This can result in a fast-paced, resource-intensive arms race in which AI systems constantly adapt.” — The Straits Times/ANN",student worker harness generative artificial intelligence tool study underground forum modified version circumvent safety filter scam content cyber security agency csa singapore cyber landscape report yesterday version chatbot customer fear generative herald cyber attack falsehood dark web tool learn hack write malware malicious code wormgpt circumvent chatgpt guard prohibition generation mail malware code scam csa sign openai chatgpt launch late cybersecurity firm trend hacker tool critical detail software company system microsoft bad actor technical protocol military equipment radar reconnaissance attack cracked chatbots effort telegram channel wormgpt shut tool password generator scale crack half common password minute technology generation deepfake image biometric authentication facial recognition security feature fraudsters underground market criminal developer impersonation service deepfakes social medium account spam content bypass anti phishing control popular mail service scam campaign concern technology cyber security sector combat scam machine algorithm detect deepfakes mail suspicious activity spot unnatural facial movement discrepancy irregularity eye reflection tale sign deepfakes developer challenge cyber security false false negative arm race criminal unsustainable organisation law enforcement agency system criminal method fool detection system result resource intensive arm race system strait time,"[(1, 0.26161388), (4, 0.73428375)]",4

709855,Main,27,24/07/2024,Europol warns of uptick in  AI-aided child abuse images,,"The Hague: Artificial intelligence-linked images of child sex abuse are on the rise, Europe’s policing agency warned, saying the material makes it increasingly difficult to identify victims and perpetrators.
 Criminals have been adopting AI tools and services to carry out a range of crimes from online fraud and cyberattacks, to creating explicit images of children, Europol said.
 “Cases of AI-assisted and AI-generated child sexual abuse material have been reported,” the Hague-based agency said in a new report.
 “The use of AI which allows child sex offenders to generate or alter child sex abuse material is set to further proliferate in the near future,” Europol added in a 37-page report, looking at current online threats facing Europe.
 The production of artificial abuse images increases “the amount of illicit material in circulation and complicates the identification of victims as well as perpetrators,” Europol said.
 More than 300 million children a year were victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse, researchers at the University of Edinburgh said in May.
 Offences ranged from so-called sextortion, where predators demand money from victims to keep images private, to the abuse of AI technology to create deepfake videos and pictures. — AFP",hague artificial intelligence image sex abuse rise europe agency material difficult identify victim perpetrator criminal tool service range crime fraud cyberattacks explicit image child child sexual abuse material hague agency report child sex offender alter child sex material proliferate future report current online threat europe production artificial abuse image amount illicit material circulation identification victim perpetrator child victim sexual exploitation abuse researcher university edinburgh offence sextortion predator money victim private abuse technology create deepfake video picture,"[(6, 0.98837346)]",6
709107,StarBiz,2,22/07/2024,"Data analytics, AI tech  can beef up bank’s security",Adoption of measures crucial to curb online scams,"PETALING JAYA: Banks should leverage on data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to further enhance security, on top of existing measures. 
 Universiti Sains Malaysia associate professor Dr Selvakumar Manickam said while AI technology is still in its infancy, the adoption of AI and data analytics as well as joining hands with key players in the ecosystem will be crucial to curb online scams. 
 He added that while the measures taken by banks to combat online bank fraud are commendable, they are not foolproof or future-proof.
 “Cybercriminals will inevitably find ways to circumvent these measures, necessitating ongoing adaptation and improvement. 
 “To combat this persistent threat, collaboration among banks, telcos, social media platforms and government agencies is crucial,” he told StarBiz. 
 Additionally, telcos can play a more significant role by implementing stricter policies for phone number registration and holding owners accountable for numbers used in fraudulent activities, Selvakumar added.
 According to the Royal Malaysia Police, a total of 71,833 scams were reported from 2020 to May 2022, amounting to losses of more than RM5.2bil.
 In December 2022, Bank Negara announced five key measures to combat financial fraud, which include migrating from short messaging service (SMS) one-time passwords to a more secure authentication method, a transaction cooling-off period, a single designated device for authorisation, removal of hyperlinks from SMS and email communications, and a 24-hour cyber fraud security online. 
 In line with this, Malayan Banking Bhd said it will be implementing a 12-hour cooling-off period for transfer limit increase requests on its Maybank2U website, effective July 31. 
 Banks like CIMB Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd (Ambank) and Public Bank Bhd have also rolled out similar efforts. 
 Other measures that banks have also employed include the kill switch or lock account and mandatory SecureTAC measures. 
 CIMB  told StarBiz since the implementation of both the cooling-off period and mandatory SecureTAC measures in June 2023, the group has observed a significant reduction of up to 88% quarter-on-quarter in unauthorised ID registrations, demonstrating the effectiveness in preventing fraud.
 Selvakumar said while the cooling-off period is a positive step, this measure may cause inconvenience for users who need to make legitimate urgent transactions.
 On this note, CIMB said while users took some time to adapt to new security measures, the preventive measures have been well received, with customers recognising the importance of protecting their banking information.
 “Most recently, we have also introduced enhanced security measures to protect users from potential fraud associated with malware that exploits screen sharing and accessibility permissions,” it said. 
 Selvakumar said the effectiveness of measures like kill switch and account lock remains unclear, as the number of scams and frauds has not significantly decreased. 
 “This could be attributed to the fact that these measures still rely on user awareness and action, which may be lacking in some cases.”
 In this regard, Direct Lending founder Yik Seong Hui said education is still the most important aspect in curbing online frauds. 
 “The steps that banks have taken so far is definitely a good step forward. Nonetheless, the burden of combating scams does not solely lie with the bank. 
 “Users also need to manage their accounts responsibly. Hence, a lot of education is still required, particularly among the lower or middle-income groups,” he said
 Meanwhile, Ambank also noted one of the key areas it is focusing on to further strengthen security measures is customer education. 
 “We have ongoing programmes across all customer touchpoints, including informative content displayed in branches and online banking platforms. Additionally, regular reminders via prevalent fraud tactics are pushed through AmOnline App’s notifications to keep customers vigilant,” it told StarBiz.
 Ambank said the cooling-off period combined with its existing measures will create a robust defence system that safeguards their customers’ financial well-being. 
 “Our security measures are constantly reviewed and updated. This proactive approach ensures we stay ahead of emerging threats and adapt our defences accordingly.”",jaya bank data analytics artificial intelligence technology enhance security top measure universiti sains associate professor selvakumar manickam technology infancy adoption data analytics hand key player crucial curb online scam bank combat bank fraud commendable foolproof future proof cybercriminals circumvent measure adaptation improvement combat persistent threat collaboration bank social medium platform government agency crucial starbiz telco play role stricter policy phone registration owner accountable fraudulent activity royal malaysia police total scam amounting loss december bank negara key measure financial fraud short messaging service sm time password secure authentication method transaction period single device authorisation removal hyperlink email communication hour fraud security online malayan banking bhd hour period transfer limit increase request website effective july bank bank bhd ammb holding ambank public bank bhd effort measure bank kill lock account mandatory securetac measure starbiz implementation period mandatory securetac measure reduction quarter quarter unauthorised registration effectiveness fraud selvakumar period positive step measure inconvenience user urgent transaction cimb user time adapt security measure preventive measure customer banking enhanced security measure user potential fraud malware screen accessibility permission effectiveness measure account lock unclear scam attributed measure user awareness action regard direct lending founder yik seong hui education aspect online fraud step bank burden scam bank user account education lower middle income ambank key strengthen security measure customer education programme customer touchpoints informative content branch online banking platform regular reminder prevalent fraud tactic amonline app notification customer starbiz ambank period measure robust defence system customer financial security measure updated proactive approach stay threat adapt defence,"[(2, 0.12563026), (5, 0.8713681)]",5
709307,Lifestyle,4,22/07/2024,What’s next after AI beats the best?,"Lee Saedol, the top Go player, was defeated by AI AlphaGo in 2016, highlighting AI’s potential to surpass human expertise and its future role in society.","LEE Saedol was the finest Go player of his generation when he suffered a decisive loss, defeated not by a human opponent but by artificial intelligence (AI).
 Lee was beaten by AlphaGo, an AI computer program developed by Google’s DeepMind unit. The stunning upset, in 2016, made headlines around the world and looked like a clear sign that AI was entering a new, profoundly unsettling era.
 By besting Lee, an 18-time world champion revered for his intuitive and creative style of play, AlphaGo had solved one of computer science’s greatest challenges: teaching itself the abstract strategy needed to win at Go, widely considered the world’s most complex board game.
 “I am very surprised because I have never thought I would lose,” Lee said at the time in a post-match news conference. “I didn’t know that AlphaGo would play such a perfect Go.”
 But the implications of his loss went far beyond the game itself, in which two players compete for territory by placing black and white stones on a gridded board made up of 19 lines by 19 lines. 
 AlphaGo’s victory demonstrated the unbridled potential of AI to achieve superhuman mastery of skills once considered too complicated for machines.
 Lee, now 41, retired three years later, convinced that humans could no longer compete with computers at Go. 
 AI, he said, had changed the very nature of a game that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago.
 “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing,” he said in a recent interview.
 As society wrestles with what AI holds for humanity’s future, Lee is now urging others to avoid being caught unprepared, as he was, and to become familiar with the technology now. 
 He delivers lectures about AI, trying to give others the advance notice he wishes he had received before his match.
 “I faced the issues of AI early, but it will happen for others,” Lee said at a community education fair in Seoul to a crowd of students and parents. “It may not be a happy ending.”
 Since his loss, Lee has become an AI obsessive of sorts, following with rapt if uneasy attention as AI delivers one breakthrough after another.
 AI has helped chatbots carry on conversations almost indistinguishable from human interaction. 
 It has solved problems that have confounded scientists for decades, like predicting protein shapes. And it has blurred the lines of creativity: writing music, producing art and generating videos.
 Lee is not a doomsayer. In his view, AI may replace some jobs, but it may create some, too. When considering AI’s grasp of Go, he said it was important to remember that humans both created the game and designed the AI system that mastered it.What he worries about is that AI may change what humans value.
 “People used to be in awe of creativity, originality and innovation,” he said. “But since AI came, a lot of that has disappeared.”
 Lee started playing Go at the age of five under the guidance of his father, a schoolteacher and enthusiast of the game. 
 His family lived on Bigeumdo, an island off the southwest coast of the Korean Peninsula inhabited by around 3,600 people.
 His immense talent was apparent from the start. He quickly became the best player of his age, not only locally but across all of South Korea, Japan and China. He turned pro at 12.
 By the time he was 20, Lee had reached 9-dan, the highest level of mastery in Go. Soon, he was among the best players in the world, described by some as the Roger Federer of the game.
 “He was an idol, he was a star,” said Lee Hajin, a former professional Go player. “Everyone looked up to him.”
 As Lee Saedol’s standing was growing, Go started garnering interest from a new audience: computer scientists. Go posed a tantalising challenge for AI researchers. 
 The game is exponentially more complicated than chess, with it often being said that there are more possible positions on a Go board (10 with more than 100 zeros after it, by many mathematical estimates) than there are atoms in the universe.
 The breakthrough came from DeepMind, which built AlphaGo using so-called neural networks: mathematical systems that can learn skills by analysing enormous amounts of data. It started by feeding the network 30 million moves from high-level players. 
 Then the program played game after game against itself until it learned which moves were successful and developed new strategies.
 By late 2015, AlphaGo had defeated a three-time European Go champion five consecutive times in a closed-door match.
 Then, Lee was approached by Lee Hajin, who was working at the International Go Federation, with a proposal for a public match with a US$1mil (RM4.67mil) prize for beating AlphaGo.Lee Saedol said he accepted the offer without much thought, figuring it would be “fun”.
 “But fun with the presumption that I was going to win,” he said. “The possibility of losing didn’t occur to me.”
 The best-of-five match, played in Seoul, was a spectacle. In South Korea, where millions of people play Go and Lee is a celebrity, the showdown led nightly television broadcasts. More than 200 million people watched, with huge audiences in China and Japan.
 During the matches, a DeepMind engineer sat across from Lee and placed the stones as relayed to him by AlphaGo. Lee said not having a true human opponent was disconcerting. 
 AlphaGo played in a style he had never seen, and it felt odd to not try to decipher what his opponent was thinking and feeling. 
 The world watched in awe as AlphaGo pushed Lee into corners and made moves unthinkable for a human player.
 “I couldn’t get used to it,” he said. “I thought that AI would beat humans someday. I just didn’t think it was here yet.”
 AlphaGo won four of five matches. Lee Sang Hoon, his older brother and a professional Go player, remembered thinking: “This can’t be.”
 “It was shocking,” said his brother, who continues to play as a professional. Like other pros, he now trains with AI systems that continue to learn and improve.
 “Pro players are studying how these algorithms work and are trying to close the gap,” his brother said. “But we are a long way away.”
 AlphaGo’s victory “was a watershed moment in the history of AI,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s CEO, in a written statement. 
 It showed what computers that learn on their own from data “were really capable of”, he said.
 Lee had a hard time accepting the defeat. What he regarded as an art form, an extension of a player’s own personality and style, was now cast aside for an algorithm’s ruthless efficiency.
 “I could no longer enjoy the game,” he said. “So I retired.”
 Lee has kept one foot in the Go world. He has written several books, including an autobiography and a series about his famous matches. 
 He has created Go-inspired board games. He founded a Go academy for children with about a dozen branches across the country.
 But AI still dominates his thoughts, partly because of the ambivalence he feels about the pros and cons, but also because it’s a subject that hits close to home.
 His 17-year-old daughter is in her final year of high school. When they discuss what she should study at university, they often consider a future shaped by AI.

707955,Lifestyle,9,19/07/2024,Challenges of creativity and AI,,"BOOKS and movies of the future could all start to feel the same if creative industries embrace artificial intelligence to help write stories, a study published recently warned.
 The research, which drew on hundreds of volunteers and was published in Science Advances, comes amid rising fears over the impact of widely available AI tools that turn simple text prompts into relatively sophisticated music, art and writing.
 “Our goal was to study to what extent and how generative AI might help humans with creativity,” co-author Anil Doshi of the University College London told AFP.
 For their experiment, Doshi and co-author Oliver Hauser of the University of Exeter recruited around 300 volunteers as “writers.”
 These were people who didn’t write for a living, and their inherent creative ability was assessed by a standard psychology test that asked them to provide 10 drastically different words.
 The scientists then split them randomly into three groups to write an eight-sentence story about one of three topics: an adventure on the open seas, an adventure in the jungle, or an adventure on another planet.
 Participants were also randomly placed into three groups that received varying levels of AI assistance.
 The first group got no help, the second was provided a three-sentence story idea from ChatGPT, and the third could receive up to five AI-generated story ideas to help them get going.
 Individual benefit,  collective loss After completing their stories, participants were asked to assess their own work’s creativity through measures including  how novel it was, how enjoyable, and how much potential the  idea had to be turned into a  published book.
 An additional 600 external human reviewers also judged the story on the same measures.
 The authors found that, on average, AI boosted the quality of an individual writer’s creativity by up to 10 percent, and the story’s enjoyability by 22 percent, helping particularly with elements like structure and plot twists.
 These effects were most significant for writers who were judged during the initial task to be the least creative, “so it has this kind of leveling the playing field effect,” said Doshi.
 But on the collective level, they found AI-assisted stories looked much more similar to each other than those produced without any AI help, as writers “anchored” themselves too heavily to the suggested ideas.
 Hauser said this created a “social dilemma.” On the one hand, “you make it easier for people to get in; lowering barriers is good.” But if the collective novelty of art decreases, “it could be harmful down the line.”
 Doshi said the research also showed that, just like introducing pocket calculators to children too early could prevent them from learning how to do basic arithmetic, there was a danger that people could rely too much on AI tools before developing underlying skills in writing, music or more.
 People need to start thinking about “where in my workflow can I insert this tool to get the most benefit, while still inserting my own voice into the project or outcome.” – AFP",book movie creative industry artificial intelligence write story drew hundred volunteer science advance fear impact tool simple text prompt sophisticated music art goal study generative human creativity author anil doshi university college london afp experiment doshi author hauser university recruited volunteer writer people inherent creative ability standard psychology test scientist write sentence story topic sea adventure jungle adventure planet participant varying level assistance sentence story idea chatgpt story idea individual collective loss story participant ass creativity measure enjoyable potential idea book additional external human reviewer story measure author boosted quality individual writer creativity percent story enjoyability percent element structure plot twist effect writer initial task creative field doshi collective level story produced writer idea social dilemma hand easier people barrier novelty art harmful doshi pocket calculator child basic arithmetic danger people tool underlying skill music people workflow insert tool benefit inserting voice project outcome afp,"[(3, 0.9937615)]",3
707989,StarBiz,4,19/07/2024,"For stocks, is AI the Emperor’s new clothes?",,"THE shine may finally be coming off artificial intelligence (AI). 
 If so, the rotation out of Big Tech into small caps that has emerged recently could quickly accelerate. The question then is whether outperforming laggards hold up the broader market, or does the AI selloff drive benchmark indices into the red?
 Another round of upbeat results and outlooks from the second-quarter earnings season will reinvigorate the bull case for all things related to AI and microchips.
 But failure to meet elevated expectations leaves the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, which make up a third of the S&P 500’s market cap and are responsible for around two-thirds of the S&P 500’s entire gains this year, highly exposed.
 Throw in the potential escalation of US-China trade wars in a possible Trump presidency that will, on balance, benefit US-based small cap firms, and you get a glimpse of how this might play out.
 Last Friday the Magnificent Seven exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes semiconductor chip maker Nvidia, tumbled 4.4%, the biggest fall since its launch in April 2023. 
 The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks had its largest one-day risk-adjusted rally in history and its third-largest outperformance versus the Nasdaq, according to a Bank of America analysis.
 Since the release of surprisingly soft US inflation data on July 10, the Russell 2000 is up 10% and the ‘Mag Seven’ ETF and NYSE FANG index, which includes the Mag Seven stocks, are both down more than 5%. The S&P 500 is now in the red too.
 Like the Emperor’s new clothes, questions about whether AI really is all it is cracked up to be are now being asked.
 Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote an article in May titled Don’t Believe the AI Hype, a pithier follow-up to an extensive research paper he penned earlier that month titled The Simple Macroeconomics of AI.
 Acemoglu argues that the estimated “total factor productivity” impact over the next decade of AI technology, in its current guise at least, is a relatively tiny 0.53%. That’s a negligible 0.05% a year.
 His forecasts for around 0.5% and 1% increases in AI-generated productivity and gross domestic product growth, respectively, over the next 10 years are significantly lower than Goldman Sachs economists’ comparable estimates of around 9% and 6%.
 Plenty cost, little benefit
 Acemoglu’s thoughts and findings were included in a June 25 note from Goldman Sachs “Gen AI: Too much spend, too little benefit?” that dissected the pros and cons of AI.
 Jim Covello, head of global equity research at the investment bank, is far more sceptical than his colleagues on the economics team.
 Covello reckons investment in expanding AI infrastructure – on data centres, utilities, and applications, among other things – will exceed US$1 trillion in coming years. 
 The crucial question, in Covello’s view, is: what US$1 trillion problem will AI solve?
 “Replacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions I’ve witnessed in my 30 years of closely following the tech industry,” he says.
 Comparisons with the early days of the Internet are misplaced. Even in its infancy the Internet was a low-cost technology solution that enabled eCommerce to replace costly existing structures – quite literally – such as brick-and-mortar buildings.
 Covello gives the example of integrating GPS into smartphones. 
 The technology for this to be rolled out widely didn’t exist in the early 2000s but – no pun intended – the “roadmap” did. The roadmap on what other technologies could eventually deliver was also there right at the start.
 Is that the case today with AI? “Eighteen months after the introduction of generative AI to the world, not one truly transformative – let alone cost-effective – application has been found,” he argues.
 No game changer
 Covello’s is one of the few voices on Wall Street to call out the AI mania so bluntly. Bob Elliott, the CEO at Unlimited Funds and a former executive at Bridgewater, this week added his.
 Even in the most optimistic scenario, Elliott says the benefits to S&P 500 companies from rising AI-related spending and increased economy-wide productivity are “modest.”
 That scenario assumes a US$1.3 trillion rise in AI spending through 2032, all by S&P 500 companies, lifting revenue growth to around 6.5% from 4%. 
 Added together, he reckons this implies a roughly US$650bil increase in S&P 500 earnings by 2032 relative to today, or about a 25% increase in nominal terms.
 Even if you ignore the difficulty in forecasting earnings eight years out, that points to around a US$10 trillion, or 25%, increase, on the S&P 500’s current market cap.
 “It’s a pretty marginal impact, not one that is game changing (and) is already likely priced in, probably fully priced last year during the summer of the AI ‘boom,” Elliott posted on X this week.
 Investors may be slowly coming round to this view. 
 Bank of America’s July fund manager survey shows that 43% of respondents now think AI is in a bubble, up five percentage points from May, while 45% don’t think so, down from more than 50% in May.
 But nothing changes sentiment like price, and it will probably take a much bigger reversal in these overcrowded trades to convince investors that the AI well has run dry. — Reuters

707965,StarBiz,9,19/07/2024,TSMC raises revenue outlook on back of AI boom,,"Taipei: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) raised its projections for full-year revenue growth after results beat estimates, riding a global wave of spending on artificial intelligence (AI).
 The chipmaker for Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp now expects sales to grow more than the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously. 
 TSMC expects revenue of as much as US$23.2bil this quarter, above analysts’ projections. And it narrowed its forecast for capital spending – a key indicator of where TSMC sees future demand – to the high end of its original forecast, to US$30bil to US$32bil from as low as US$28bil previously.  
 The raised outlook conveys TSMC’s confidence in the longevity of an AI boom that began in late 2022 with the advent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. That spurred global tech giants from Microsoft Corp to Baidu Inc to splurge on AI infrastructure, largely powered by Nvidia accelerators. 
 Market expectations had risen in the weeks leading up to TSMC’s report. The wider smartphone market – another big driver for Taiwan’s largest company – is on a path to recovery. 
 Apple provided upbeat guidance to suppliers on shipments of its upcoming iPhone 16, based on the potential strength of its new AI services. That helped TSMC report a better-than-anticipated 36% rise in June-quarter profit.
 Net income rose to NT$247.8bil or about US$7.6bil, after the company disclosed its second-quarter sales grew at the fastest pace since 2022.
 Shares of the world’s largest maker of advanced chips have more than doubled since the AI boom took off in late 2022, and hit a series of all-time highs as the firm’s market capitalisation briefly crossed the US$1 trillion mark.
 Still, investor euphoria over TSMC’s prospects diminished Wednesday after Bloomberg Businessweek published comments by US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who said he’s at best lukewarm about defending Taiwan in the event of Chinese aggression. 
 On top of that, the United States is also mulling stricter chip curbs on China, Bloomberg News reported, triggering a global tech stock selloff as investors pondered the fallout for the world’s largest semiconductor arena.
 Caution about AI is now emerging in corners of the market. This month, Goldman Sachs warned that the biggest US tech firms may be spending too much on AI.

707967,StarBiz,9,19/07/2024,Samsung Electronics  buys British  AI tech startup,,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics has bought a British startup that develops advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the South Korean tech giant says, as demand for its high-end chips used in AI hardware surges.
 Oxford Semantic Technologies specialises in knowledge graph technology – a more advanced way of storing complex information in a web – Samsung said in a statement yesterday.
 It added that it expected to use the technology “not only in mobile devices but also in a wide range of products, including TVs and home appliances, in the future”.
 Samsung did not disclose the value of the deal.
 From generative capabilities such as writing texts from brief instructions to simultaneous translation of phone conversations, tech titans are in a frantic race to more fully deploy AI technology in smartphones and other consumer products.
 The purchase of Oxford Semantic marks the latest move by Samsung to strengthen its AI offerings.
 Samsung Electronics is the world’s biggest producer of memory chips, including versions used in top-of-the-line AI hardware from industry leaders.
 The firm is also one of the world’s biggest smartphone makers, and the latest models it unveiled in January are powered by its own Galaxy AI tech.

 “Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza in an Instagram post several days ago showed a WhatsApp video call that seemed as if she was talking, when it is actually a live deepfake.
 “AI can be used for good and evil. We need to be cautious of the information received and ensure any video received is genuine or produced through an AI application,” he said at the ministry’s monthly assembly here yesterday, Bernama reported. 
 As such, Fahmi called on the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) and Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) to publicise and educate the public on the dangers of scam tactics using AI deepfakes.
 On Sunday, the country’s top singer revealed the latest tactic by scammers believed to be using AI technology to imitate her voice and face for profit.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi will meet with representatives of all social media platforms in Singapore later this month to discuss several matters, including the dangers of AI on their platforms.
 “I hope the issue of AI-generated deepfakes can be addressed by Meta as WhatsApp is under Meta’s responsibility,” he said.
 He also suggested that all ministries utilise the benefits of AI in their tasks and requested the Tun Abdul Razak Broad­casting and Information Institute (IPPTAR) to coordinate courses on the technology.
 “AI can help not only in creating content but also in several other aspects, such as coding, programming, data analysis and other areas where AI can be beneficial,” he said.

707029,Main,13,16/07/2024,‘Siti Nurhaliza scam’ uses AI to convince victims,,"POPULAR singer Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza Tarudin’s (pic) voice has been exploited in scams using artificial intelligence (AI) to replicate her appearance and speech.
 Victims are lured with the promise of a video call from the singer, which turns out to be an AI-generated simulation displaying her face and voice.
 Subsequently, victims are tricked into parting with their money for fictitious rewards, reported Harian Metro.
 Siti Nurhaliza took to her social media on Sunday to expose these fraudulent activities, sharing a video of these fabricated calls.
 “Fake. Do not believe the scammers. They are using my name and picture, and even an AI voice to convince people.
 “They also took my live videos with the intent to entrap and deceive people,” she said.
 She urged the public to raise awareness about these scams, emphasising: “I have never ­organised any contests or offered cash rewards to anyone.
 “Do not be deceived when receiving these messages and video calls,”
 According to Siti Nurhaliza, numerous fraudsters have exploited her identity and image, often targeting the elderly.
 > Actress Nora Danish, 42, has moved on from her divorce and is indifferent to her ex-husband Mohamed Nedim Nazri being seen with another woman, reported Berita Harian.
 “It’s okay if he is seen with another woman because I requested the divorce. Please leave him to his life and don’t inform me, okay?” she posted  on Instagram.
 Expressing exasperation at meddlesome social media users, Nora clarified that she no longer lives with Nedim because they are divorced.
 She added that they have gone their separate ways and now only communicate on matters involving their six-year-old son.

706623,Lifestyle,4,15/07/2024,AI’senergy appetite,"AI’s growing demand for energy  is driving up emissions, challenging tech giants’ sustainability goals.","WHEN Google announced recently that its climate emissions had risen by 48% since 2019, it pointed the finger at artificial intelligence (AI).
 US tech firms are building vast networks of data centres across the globe and say AI is fuelling the growth, throwing the spotlight on the amount of energy the technology is sucking up and its impact on the environment.
 How does AI use electricity? Every time a user punches a request into a chatbot or generative AI tool, the request is fired off to a data centre.
 Even before that stage, developing AI programs known as large language models (LLMs) needs a huge amount of computer power.
 All the while, the computers are burning through electricity, and the servers get hotter, meaning more electricity to cool them.
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report earlier this year that data centres in general used roughly 40% of electricity for computing and 40% for cooling.
 Why are experts worried? Big tech firms have been rushing to pack all their products with AI ever since OpenAI launched its ChatGPT bot in late 2022.
 Plenty of experts are concerned that these new products will cause electricity usage to spike.
 This is firstly because AI services require more power than their non-AI analogues.
 For example, various studies have shown that each request made to ChatGPT uses roughly 10 times the power of a single Google search.
 So if Google switches all search queries to AI – about nine billion a year – it could hugely inflate the company’s electricity usage.
 And most of these new services and products rely on LLMs.
 Programming these algorithms is extremely intensive and usually requires high-powered computer chips.
 They in turn require more cooling, which uses more electricity.
 How much energy does AI use? Before the era of AI, estimates generally suggested data centres accounted for around 1% of global electricity demand.
 The IEA report said data centres, cryptocurrencies and AI combined used 460TWh of electricity worldwide in 2022, or almost 2% of total global electricity demand.
 The IEA estimated that the figure could double by 2026 – the equivalent of Japan’s usage figures.
 Alex De Vries, a researcher who runs the Digiconomist website, modelled the electricity used by AI alone by focusing on sales projections from the US firm Nvidia, which has cornered the market in AI-  specialised servers.
 He concluded in a paper late last year that if Nvidia’s projected sales for 2023 were correct and all those servers ran at full power, they alone could be responsible for between 85.4TWh to 134.0TWh of annual electricity consumption – an amount similar to Argentina or Sweden.
 “The numbers I put in that article were already conservative to begin with because I couldn’t include things like cooling requirements,” he said.
 And he added that adoption of Nvidia’s servers had outstripped last year’s projections, so the figures would certainly be higher.
 How are data centres coping? Fabrice Coquio of Digital Realty, a data centre company that leases its services to others, said during a visit to one of its enormous facilities north of Paris in April that AI was going to transform his industry.
 “It’s going to be exactly the same (as the cloud), maybe a bit more massive in terms of the deployment,” he said.
 Part of Digital Realty’s latest data centre hub in Courneuve – a gigantic edifice that looks like a football stadium – will be dedicated to AI.
 Coquio explained that typical computing requests could be handled by server racks in rooms with powerful air-conditioning systems
 But AI racks use much more powerful components, get much hotter and require water to be physically pumped into the equipment, he said.
 “For sure, this requires different servers, storage equipment, communication equipment,” Coquio said.
 Is it sustainable? The biggest players in AI and data centres – Amazon, Google and Microsoft – have been trying to reduce their carbon footprints by buying up vast amounts of renewable energy.
 Amazon official Prasad Kalyanaraman said the firm’s data centre division, AWS, was “the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world today”.
 AWS is committed to being a net-zero carbon company by 2040. Google and Microsoft have pledged to reach that goal by 2030.
 But building new data centres and ramping up usage in existing ones is not going to help with green energy targets.
 Both Google and Microsoft have said in recent reports that their greenhouse gas emissions have been rising in the last few years.
 Google flagged a 48% rise from 2019 and Microsoft a 30% increase from 2020.
 Both have squarely blamed AI.
 Microsoft President Brad Smith told Bloomberg in May that the pledge was a “moonshot” made before the AI “explosion”, adding that “the Moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020”. – AFP",google climate emission finger artificial intelligence tech firm vast network data centre fuelling growth spotlight amount energy technology impact environment electricity time user punch chatbot generative tool request data centre stage program language model huge amount computer power computer electricity server electricity international energy agency iea report data centre electricity expert tech firm pack product chatgpt bot late plenty expert product electricity usage spike service power analogue study chatgpt time power single google search google switch query inflate company electricity usage service product algorithm intensive computer chip electricity energy era estimate data centre global electricity demand iea report data centre cryptocurrencies twh electricity total global electricity demand iea figure double equivalent japan usage figure vries run digiconomist website electricity sale projection firm market server paper late nvidia sale server power responsible twh twh annual electricity consumption amount sweden article conservative cooling requirement nvidia server projection figure data centre fabrice coquio digital realty data company lease service enormous facility april transform industry cloud massive term deployment digital realty data centre hub courneuve gigantic edifice football stadium coquio typical computing request rack powerful air system rack powerful component hotter water equipment server storage equipment communication equipment coquio sustainable biggest player data centre google microsoft carbon footprint vast amount renewable energy amazon official prasad kalyanaraman firm data centre division largest purchaser renewable energy aws committed net carbon company google reach goal building data centre usage green energy target microsoft report greenhouse gas emission google rise microsoft increase microsoft president brad smith bloomberg pledge moonshot explosion moon time,"[(4, 0.99642646)]",4
706699,StarBiz,4,15/07/2024,Forging the AI destiny:  TiPM’s holistic approach,,"IN a world where artificial intelligence (AI) continues to redefine industries and economies powerfully, Technology Innovation Park Malaysia (TiPM) stands at the forefront of driving innovation and empowering the nation’s AI future through critical initiatives and a holistic approach.
 To strategically align with Malaysia’s aspiration of becoming a regional AI hub, TiPM aims to fortify the country’s position in the global AI landscape by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic advancement through AI technologies, which also underscores TiPM’s continuous commitment to driving sustainable growth and competitiveness in the digital era.
 TiPM’s vision for national AI development rests on the following essential building blocks:
 > AI 	talent cultivation: TiPM leverages the National Technology Innovation Sandbox programme and collaborates with Nvidia to offer AI-focused upskilling and reskilling programs through the AI sandbox pilot programme. 
 The aim is to empower the local workforce with essential AI knowledge, fostering over 13,000 new AI 	talents by 2026. This aligns seamlessly with Malaysia’s National AI Roadmap 2021-2025, emphasising the 	development of a robust talent pool.
 > Startup Nurturing: TiPM’s AI Sandbox Pilot Programme also aims to nurture AI startups – a remarkable 900 of them by 2026. This ambitious target, tenfold the national goal of incubating 100 AI companies to generate RM1bil in revenue by 2030, underscores this project’s immense scale and potential.
 > Strengthening national AI infrastructure and innovation ecosystem: TiPM’s AI Park, Malaysia’s first, is a vibrant hub for integrating diverse technologies. As a centre of excellence, it bolsters innovation ecosystems in drones, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, supporting innovators, researchers, and companies in refining solutions within a controlled environment.
 > Global competitiveness: Our strategic partnership with Nvidia vividly demonstrates TiPM’s unwavering commitment to equipping Malaysia’s workforce for the dynamic global AI landscape.

 > Conducting awareness campaigns, seminars, and conferences to educate industry stakeholders about AI’s benefits – by demystifying AI and showcasing successful case studies, we encourage adoption.
 TiPM also tailors its support to specific industries.
 AI transformation is across industries and some sectors have emerged as frontrunners in embracing this technology, such as information technology (IT); professional, scientific, and technical services; finance and insurance, and manufacturing, as can be seen from “The AI Index 2024”, annual report by Standford University.
 However, other key sectors poised to benefit massively from AI include agriculture, healthcare, and hospitality. These sectors also play a pivotal role in maintaining Malaysia’s competitive edge within the region’s economy.
 Malaysia’s agriculture sector requires revolutionary operational innovation, and AI can play a key role in this. 
 Additionally, healthcare exhibits significant potential, with approximately 22% of projects focused on adoption within this industry – making it a prominent player among Malaysia’s sectors.
 Meanwhile, despite making significant strides in integrating AI into our digital transformation recently, Malaysia is still catching up with its regional peers.
 China, for instance, has seen remarkable success due to its massive scale and extensive proof-of-concept trials that generate vast amounts of data for AI development.
 According to “The AI Index 2024”, the United States still leads China, the European Union (EU), and the UK as the source of top AI models. 
 In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from US-based institutions, far outpacing the EU’s 21 and China’s 15.
 However, according to the same report, China far outpaces other nations in AI patents. 
 In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the United States, which accounted for only 20.9% of AI patent origins. 
 These might be the early signs that the centre of technology innovation leadership and power is indeed shifting to East Asia and the Pacific.
 Singapore also demonstrates impressive AI readiness across different dimensions.
 For example, in the Government AI Readiness Index 2023 by Oxford Insights, Singapore emerged as the global leader in government AI readiness, while according to the Asia- Pacific (Apac) AI Readiness Index 2023 by Salesforce, Singapore leads the Apac region with a score of 70.1, followed by Japan (59.8) and China (59.7). Malaysia (48.2) comes eighth in the region.
 Notably, according to the later report, except for Singapore, all South-East Asian countries –Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam –achieved scores below the Apac average in their overall AI readiness. However, these nations have only recently introduced national AI policies and strategies (between 2021 and 2022) –Malaysia in 2021. 
 Thus, we may soon witness the practical impact of these AI initiatives on businesses and government organisations.
 Positive signs
 However, there are very positive signs that Malaysia’s AI ecosystem might be just heating up, and Malaysia is progressing well in integrating AI and positioning itself as an AI hub in the region.
 For example, according to the aforementioned Government AI Readiness Index 2023, Malaysia has been reported as a notable exception – a non-high-income country punching above its weight. Malaysia’s overall score is 68.71, which is much higher than the average score of 43.69 for upper middle-income countries, and it is ranked 23rd globally (an improvement from 29th in the 2022 index) and sixth in East Asia after such well-known AI-leading nations like Singapore, South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. 
 These rankings consider factors such as AI vision, policy, technology integration and data accessibility.
 According to Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2023, Malaysia is positioned higher than Taiwan in terms of the estimated impact of AI adoption on annual productivity growth over 10 years, just below the global average.
 Based on the Ipsos survey, 69% of Malaysian respondents view AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful, lower than Indonesia (78%) and Thailand (74%) but significantly higher than many Western countries, as highlighted in Standford’s AI Index Report 2024.
 AI potential
 Additionally, apart from Nvidia, other major global tech players are showing interest in Malaysia’s AI potential, and Microsoft’s recent investment of US$2.2bil to support the country’s digital transformation is a significant milestone.
 The government has also announced a partnership with Google to train individuals in AI and data analytics at no cost, and the company is considering the creation of a Google data centre in Malaysia.
 According to a study by IBM’s institute for business value, nearly a third of surveyed companies in Malaysia have already integrated generative AI, and over 40% of information and communications technology professionals report that their organisations are actively exploring the use of generative AI to drive business growth.
 Malaysia does face challenges such as data privacy concerns, lack of skilled talent, and slow regulatory adaptation. 
 Addressing these hurdles will be crucial for sustained AI growth.Therefore, as our nation continues to navigate towards a future where AI transcends being just a technology to become a transformative force for progress, it is imperative that we steadfastly support and advocate for initiatives that propel Malaysia to the forefront of the global AI landscape. 
 By uniting in our efforts, we can leverage the potent combination of innovation, entrepreneurship, and talent development to pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future for all Malaysians.

706695,StarBiz,11,15/07/2024,OpenAI working on new reasoning technology,Approach to deliver advanced capabilities to ChatGPT,"San Francisco: ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a novel approach to its artificial intelligence (AI) models in a project code-named “Strawberry”, according to a person familiar with the matter and internal documentation reviewed by Reuters.
 The project, details of which have not been previously reported, comes as the Microsoft-backed startup races to show that the types of models it offers are capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities.
 Teams inside OpenAI are working on Strawberry, according to a copy of a recent internal OpenAI document seen by Reuters in May. Reuters could not ascertain the precise date of the document, which details a plan for how OpenAI intends to use Strawberry to perform research. 
 The source described the plan as a work in progress. The news agency could not establish how close Strawberry is to being publicly available.
 How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said.
 The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company’s AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms “deep research”, according to the source.
 This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers.
 Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: “We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. 
 Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time.”
 The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry.
 The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough.
 Two sources described viewing earlier this year what OpenAI staffers told them were Q* demos, capable of answering tricky science and maths questions out of reach of today’s commercially-available models.
 Last Tuesday at an internal all-hands meeting, OpenAI showed a demo of a research project that it claimed had new human-like reasoning skills, according to Bloomberg. 
 An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the meeting but declined to give details of the contents. Reuters could not determine if the project demonstrated was Strawberry.
 OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models’ reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialised way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets.
 Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence.
 While large language models (LLMs) can already summarise dense texts and compose elegant prose far more quickly than any human, the technology often falls short on common–sense problems whose solutions seem intuitive to people, like recognising logical fallacies and playing tic-tac-toe. 
 When the model encounters these kinds of problems, it often “hallucinates” bogus information.
 AI researchers interviewed by Reuters generally agree that reasoning, in the context of AI, involves the formation of a model that enables AI to plan ahead, reflect how the physical world functions, and work through challenging multi-step problems reliably.
 Improving reasoning in AI models is seen as the key to unlocking the ability for the models to do everything from making major scientific discoveries to planning and building new software applications. 
 OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said earlier this year that in AI “the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability”.
 Other companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft are likewise experimenting with different techniques to improve reasoning in AI models, as are most academic labs that perform AI research. 
 Researchers differ, however, on whether LLMs are capable of incorporating ideas and long-term planning into how they do prediction. For instance, one of the pioneers of modern AI, Yann LeCun, who works at Meta, has frequently said that LLMs are not capable of human-like reasoning.
 Strawberry is a key component of OpenAI’s plan to overcome those challenges, the source familiar with the matter said. The document seen by Reuters described what Strawberry aims to enable, but not how.
 In recent months, the company has privately been signalling to developers and other outside parties that it is on the cusp of releasing technology with significantly more advanced reasoning capabilities, according to four people who have heard the company’s pitches. 
 They declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak about private matters.
 Strawberry includes a specialised way of what is known as “post-training” OpenAI’s generative AI models, or adapting the base models to hone their performance in specific ways after they have already been “trained” on reams of generalised data, one of the sources said.
 The post-training phase of developing a model involves methods like “fine-tuning”, a process used on nearly all language models today that comes in many flavours, such as having humans give feedback to the model based on its responses and feeding it examples of good and bad answers.
 Strawberry has similarities to a method developed at Stanford in 2022 called “Self-Taught Reasoner” or “STaR”, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
 STaR enables AI models to “bootstrap” themselves into higher intelligence levels via iteratively creating their own training data, and in theory could be used to get language models to transcend human-level intelligence, one of its creators, Stanford professor Noah Goodman, told Reuters.
 “I think that is both exciting and terrifying if things keep going in that direction we have some serious things to think about as humans,” Goodman said. Goodman is not affiliated with OpenAI and is not familiar with Strawberry.
 Among the capabilities OpenAI is aiming Strawberry at is performing long-horizon tasks, the document says, referring to complex tasks that require a model to plan ahead and perform a series of actions over an extended period of time, the first source explained.
 To do so, OpenAI is creating, training and evaluating the models on what the company calls a “deep-research” dataset, according to the OpenAI internal documentation. 
 Reuters was unable to determine what is in that dataset or how long an extended period would mean.
 OpenAI specifically wants its models to use these capabilities to conduct research by browsing the web autonomously with the assistance of a “CUA”, or a computer-using agent, that can take actions based on its findings, according to the document and one of the sources. OpenAI also plans to test its capabilities on doing the work of software and machine-learning engineers. — Reuters",san francisco chatgpt maker approach artificial intelligence model code strawberry person familiar matter internal documentation reuters project detail microsoft startup race type model offer capable advanced capability team openai internal openai document reuters reuters precise document detail openai strawberry source plan news agency strawberry secret person document describes project strawberry model company generate answer query navigate internet openai term source model interview dozen researcher detail story openai company spokesperson statement model continuous capability common practice industry belief system time spokesperson address question strawberry project reuters inside company breakthrough source openai staffer demo capable tricky science math question model internal hand openai demo project human skill bloomberg openai spokesperson meeting detail content reuters project strawberry openai innovation model capability person familiar strawberry involves model pre datasets researcher reuters key human super human level intelligence language model summarise dense text compose elegant prose human technology short common sense solution people logical fallacy tic tac toe model encounter hallucinates researcher reuters context formation model plan reflect physical function multi step model key unlocking ability model major scientific discovery building software application chief executive officer altman progress ability company meta microsoft likewise technique model academic lab perform researcher capable idea term planning prediction instance pioneer modern yann lecun meta capable human strawberry key component openai plan challenge source familiar matter document reuters aim enable month company developer party technology capability people company pitch authorised speak private matter specialised post training openai generative model base model performance specific ream data source phase model method fine process language model human model response example bad answer similarity stanford taught reasoner star source matter star model intelligence level data theory language model human level intelligence creator professor noah goodman reuters direction human goodman goodman openai familiar strawberry capability strawberry horizon task document complex task model plan perform series action period time source model company deep dataset internal documentation reuters unable determine dataset period openai model capability web cua computer agent action finding document source plan capability software machine engineer reuters,"[(4, 0.9973019)]",4
705513,StarBiz,2,12/07/2024,Questions to ask                  when companies use AI,Expert: Aim for full optimisation and goals to achieve,"KUALA LUMPUR: Businesses across all sectors need to use artificial intelligence (AI) with clarity rather than dive into it for fear of losing out, says Kyndryl managing director Malaysia and Indonesia Effendi Azmi Hashim.
 As an information technology (IT) infrastructure services provider, Effendi said some people in management that he had spoken to, were unsure of why their companies are beginning to use AI or how to use it responsibly.
 “When I say clarity, I mean knowing why you are using it, and what is the goal or outcome you want to see. 
 “The problem with AI is most people will try to use it for everything,” he told StarBiz on the sidelines of the “Third Malaysian banking conference 2024: Banking in the era of GenAI reshaping banking, innovating for the new economy and accelerating sustainability,” here yesterday.
 According to Effendi, once a budget has been allocated for AI, it was wise to aim for full optimisation of what can be achieved, namely the process, function and industry.
 “If you are going to do it for the process, then what is the time frame you would like to see things change?  
 “If you are doing it for function, how can AI make the workforce more productive? These are questions to ask,” he said.
 He added some businesses are already halfway into their AI journey, only to make a pit stop and question why they started in the first place.
 “A question I get asked a lot is, what is AI? I’m not being asked that as a test, but rather to give them an assurance that it is relevant and what can be achieved from it. 
 “When businesses and organisations have strong and solid plans for their AI journey, then they are more likely to be responsible when using AI and have strong governance backing it,” Effendi noted.
 Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers chief executive Edward Ling said the use of AI in the banking sector is not new.
 It was no longer the matter of adopting AI, but realising its full potential and how it can be of assistance, he said.
 There are two aspects of productivity which had been estimated to increase by 30% from the use of AI.
 “First, there’s speed, which determines how more efficient an organisation can become. But then we also need to focus more on the value creation of it. For instance, if we’re talking about sales and marketing, how can AI personalise customer service or create better products?”
 Meanwhile, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) group technology, data and digital, human capital director Dr Shameem Farouk said the bank began its AI journey in 2018.
 Her role was to upskill and reskill employees so they would be ready for AI.
 “I organised a programme for them to learn about AI and at a strategic level, how AI can contribute value to our customers and shareholders. 
 “Our top management took the time to also learn programming, because for them, they see the future as the bank being enabled by technology,” she said.She added the competition was no longer just among banks, but technology companies that were venturing into banking.
 “Maybank looked at our talent and said they must be of high technology capability people. If the senior management and top management are to lead a tech workforce, then we ourselves need to be equipped to know how to do it,” Shameem noted.
 On the question of where Malaysia’s banking sector and its adoption of AI stands among the other countries in the region, Ling said the sector is not too far behind its peers.
 “When we went overseas and exchanged experiences, we found that we are really not that far behind, or we are at par. So it all depends on individual banks, how fast you are picking yourself up,” he said.
 Ling explained that bigger banks that have more funding might invest more, leading them to have stronger advancements in the industry.

705545,StarBiz,10,12/07/2024,Power-guzzling AI                             to drive ESG debt sales,Global demand for energy-intensive data centres rising,"NEW YORK: The global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy is driving demand for energy-intensive data centres, which could end up being a factor that boosts sales of green debt in the United States, according to Morgan Stanley. 
 Sales of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-linked bonds in the United States have plunged over the last few years as Republicans push back on ESG investing and investors fret over greenwashing concerns.
 But data centres’ growing electricity needs to sustain the AI boom could fuel demand for more energy, including from renewable resources. 
 That’s likely to bolster sales of green debt, said Melissa James, vice-chairman of global capital markets at Morgan Stanley.
 Even with slowness in the United States, as of June, green debt issuance globally is running at the fastest pace since the market’s inception in 2007. 
 By the end of 2024, Morgan Stanley expects sales to soar to the trillion-dollar mark seen in 2021.  
 “We’re on pace to actually meet or maybe even exceed slightly that record issuance level,” said James.
 James spoke with Bloomberg News in a series of interviews ending on July 10. 
 Below are highlights of the conversation, condensed and edited for clarity.
 What’s fuelling the record issuance we’ve seen in the global sustainable bond market?Climate is perceived to be the single biggest existential threat of our time. 
 Issuers are focusing more narrowly on their climate and transition objectives, particularly as we start to approach the 2030 deadline that a lot of clients have set interim emission reduction targets by.
 The year 2021 was the high water mark for ESG-labelled issuance, with just over a trillion dollars. 
 Theoretically, we’re on pace to actually meet or maybe even exceed slightly that record issuance level.
 Companies, especially in the United States, aren’t selling a lot of labelled bonds. Is that going to change any time soon?Corporate issuance has been relatively flat over the last several years. With the maturation of the market, some of the issuers who had their one or two projects to fund have funded those projects, and so, they’re not going to be repeat issuers necessarily every year. 
 They may come back in two or three years, or during their next capital expenditure cycle. 
 So, there’s a certain percentage of the market that I think falls in that category where they’re sort of one-and-done for the time being.
 There are the other perennial issuers who will be repeat issuers with some degree of periodicity. But those will be smaller relative to the overall size of the market. 
 So, what’s going to drive corporate issuance in the United States?For companies that have the opportunity to invest in projects where the economics make sense, where the return on investment is justifiable and where they can decarbonise, those companies will do that all day long. 
 We’ve seen a number of issuers in some of the hard-to-abate sectors like basic materials – chemicals in particular – come to market and in some instances, they will finance those with green-labelled issuances. The second driver, in our judgment, is the tremendous demand for power as a consequence of the AI boom. 
 This phenomenon is putting increased demand on the need for additional power sources, renewable or otherwise, including alternative power sources. 
 Some of these data centres, if they’re operated at a certain threshold in terms of their energy efficiency, they themselves actually qualify for ESG-labelled or green-labelled transactions. We think that that has the potential to also help fuel activity.What about green convertible bonds?We did a lot of convertibles for companies last year that were kind of in the energy transition space. 
 You tend to see higher-growth companies that are still evolving, or earlier in their life cycle from a cash flow perspective, accessing the convertible market to take advantage of the fact that they have equity that’s perceived to have a lot of upside. And they can use that perceived upside as a way to lower their interest coupon today. These transactions are also typically issued in the 144A market and that can be an advantage to some borrowers as well.
 What do you think might drive issuance outside the United States? Latin America has been very active, for instance. The Latin America region has been an emerging growth area of ESG-labelled issuance due to its unique geographic characteristics and proximity to extensive natural resources. For example, Brazil has the potential to be the world’s lowest cost producer of green hydrogen due to its abundance of water. 
 The climate crisis and geopolitical conflict has also advanced a need to rethink and relocate supply chains. 
 Nearshoring or “friend-shoring” presents an opportunity for Mexico and others in the region, as global supply chains become more difficult to secure. —Bloomberg",york global artificial intelligence frenzy demand energy intensive data centre boost sale green debt morgan stanley sale environmental social governance esg bond united republican push investor fret concern data centre electricity sustain boom fuel demand energy renewable resource bolster sale green debt melissa james vice chairman global capital market stanley slowness june green debt issuance fastest pace market inception stanley sale dollar mark pace meet record issuance level james bloomberg news series interview highlight conversation edited clarity fuelling record issuance global sustainable bond market climate single biggest existential threat time issuer climate transition objective approach deadline lot client interim emission reduction target water mark esg issuance dollar pace meet record issuance level company lot bond change time corporate issuance flat maturation market issuer project project repeat issuer expenditure cycle percentage market category sort time perennial issuer issuer periodicity relative size market drive corporate issuance united company opportunity project sense return investment justifiable decarbonise company day issuer hard abate sector basic material chemical market instance finance green issuance tremendous demand power consequence boom phenomenon increased demand additional power source renewable alternative power source data centre threshold term energy efficiency esg green labelled transaction potential fuel activity green convertible bond convertible company energy transition space growth company life cycle cash flow perspective convertible market advantage equity lot upside lower coupon transaction market advantage borrower issuance united latin america active instance latin america region growth issuance unique geographic characteristic proximity natural resource potential lowest cost producer green hydrogen abundance water climate crisis geopolitical conflict rethink relocate supply chain friend opportunity mexico region global supply chain difficult secure bloomberg,"[(5, 0.21764931), (6, 0.7795792)]",6
705547,StarBiz,15,12/07/2024,Microsoft ditches OpenAI observer seat,Firm is trying to stave off antitrust scrutiny,"BRUSSELS: Microsoft has given up its board observer seat at OpenAI in a move aimed at easing US and UK antitrust regulators’ concerns about the extent of its control over the artificial intelligence (AI) startup amid the soaring popularity of generative AI. 
 But the change was unlikely to resolve concerns by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a source at the agency said.
 The FTC is conducting an antitrust review of deals by Big Tech firms and top AI companies.
 The move shows Microsoft sees significant potential antitrust exposure and is trying to get ahead of it, the FTC source said.
 A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
 Meanwhile, Apple, which said last month it was bringing OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to its devices, will not take an observer role on OpenAI’s board after being widely expected to do so, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
 The person added that OpenAI has no future plans to offer any board observer roles. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
 An OpenAI spokesperson said the company would establish a new approach to engaging with stakeholders by hosting regular meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. 
 Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI’s board in November after OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.
 The seat meant Microsoft could attend OpenAI’s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.
 The observer seat and Microsoft’s more than US$10bil investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in the European Union, Britain and the United States over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.
 The position provided insights into the board’s work without compromising its independence, Microsoft said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.
 It cited OpenAI’s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman’s return to the startup as reasons for giving up its observer seat.
 “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction. 
 “Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,” it said in the letter.  — Reuters",brussels board openai move antitrust regulator concern control artificial intelligence startup popularity generative change resolve concern federal trade commission source agency antitrust review deal tech firm top company potential antitrust exposure ftc source spokesperson microsoft reply request comment apple month openai chatbot chatgpt device role board person direct knowledge matter person future plan board observer apple respond request comment spokesperson company approach stakeholder regular meeting strategic partner apple investor thrive capital khosla venture position board november chief executive officer altman rein company seat microsoft attend openai board meeting access confidential voting right matter director microsoft bil investment openai unease antitrust watchdog european union britain control openai position insight board independence microsoft letter openai openai partnership innovation customer base altman return startup reason month progress board confident company direction role letter reuters,"[(2, 0.37299848), (3, 0.6213995)]",3
703371,Main,14,06/07/2024,Aiming high in the face of AI,Journalists have embraced it as a ‘co-worker’ but with real people serving as gatekeepers to ensure the truth and the human touch.,"THE media, like many other industries, has had to face a series of hurdles in the last decade. But the last few years have been the hardest.The advent of digitalisation and the rise in popularity of social media have changed how people consume news; these are challenges that have been the most deadly.
 The media has had to quickly adjust itself to changing trends and pivot – meaning, we changed the way we tell our stories, both in terms of platform and content.
 Just when we thought we had overcome them, there is a bigger quake set to shake our world to its very core: Artificial Intelligence.Before the world population fully took in the magnet that was social media, AI crept in, an invisible being that reads your habits and pushes to you the news and stories you care about the most.
 It is customised for you alone. It is the invisible friend who knows you better than you probably know yourself. And this is just part of what it can do.
  And here’s the scary part: Like the sci-fi robot models, it is still improving itself.
 How is the media going to take this? Are we going to run away or embrace it?
 I say we ride the waves. Navigate the rough seas but keep our feet firmly on the surfboard we are perched on.
 The media could make use of AI to better understand data and habits, improve efficiency and perhaps even in the production of certain content.
 But it remains just a tool, to be handled by real people. 
 We improve workflow but the ever-important journalistic rules and standards must be maintained.
 Customisation is attractive, of course. But it should never replace diversity in all aspects, and we need flesh and blood editors to lend their expertise and experience to exercise caution, maintain journalistic ethics and deal with prejudices.
 Of course, the best way to combat any type of competition is to embrace it, and to do this, we need to arm ourselves and learn all about it.
 That’s the plan, anyway.
 First things first. We fall back on our “armour”. 
 The Star is made up of a team of passionate and creative individuals always ready to switch tactics and go back to what we have been trained for – elevate the basic tenets of journalism, stand up for the people and deliver content to our audience through whatever platform they prefer.
 So, we let it be known that behind this invisible new “co-worker” of ours that can make sense of data in seconds, there are real people, in the form of editors huddling together, being gatekeepers.
 There are also journalists trained to cross-examine statements, talk to people and, of course, dig up and present a good story – with the human touch. That’s one of the greatest odds ever in our favour. For now, anyway.
 We need people of experience checking and killing fake news and not unintentionally spreading it like a machine would most be able to do.
 These days, anyone with a smartphone can call themselves a journalist, not knowing or caring that navigating through misinformation and fake news is a challenge all by itself.
 Perhaps this is the best time for trained journalists and traditional media to celebrate the foundations of journalism: getting the story right – something AI struggles to do at this point – being the bridge between the people and authorities, and analysing issues, besides influencing and shaping society.
 Most importantly, we need to give the people a voice. After all, we are what someone once called the curators of culture! 
 The role of the media is to tell stories of the people of the land, to reflect on the lives of the people whose voices it represents – their hopes and dreams, their joys and sadness.
 Perhaps this is the time for professional journalists to set themselves apart from all the noise and be what they have been trained for: to be the voice of reason.
 While we chart our future in this new world, we should be proud of retaining the basics of what made us journalists in the first place.
 Here’s to embracing the madness but always finding the time to step back and marvel at the process of telling the great stories waiting to be told.

702691,StarBiz,9,04/07/2024,Google’s emissions shoot up 48% over five years due to AI,,"NEW YORK: Google’s emissions have climbed by almost half over five years, as the company has infused artificial intelligence (AI) throughout many of its core products – making it harder to meet its goal of eliminating carbon emissions by 2030, according to a new environmental report from the tech giant.
 The annual report released covers Google’s progress toward meeting its environmental goals last year. 
 The Alphabet Inc unit said its greenhouse gas emissions totalled 14.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent throughout 2023. This is 48% higher than in 2019, the company said, and 13% higher than in 2022. 
 Google said higher energy consumption at its data centres and emissions from its supply chain were to blame, and said its push to add AI to its products could make it more difficult to reduce emissions going forward.
 “As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,” Google said in the report.
 For several years, the Mountain View, California-based company has said it plans to eliminate such emissions from its operations by 2030.
 AI – and in particular generative AI, which takes in user inputs and spits out new content like text, images or songs – is extremely resource-intensive, as a recent Bloomberg News investigation showed. 
 As the technology grows rapidly, more and more data centres are needed to build and run it, leading to surging power requirements.
 The dramatic increase in power demands from Silicon Valley’s growth-at-all-costs approach to AI threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations as well as the clean energy goals of trillion-dollar tech companies. 
 In some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Malaysia, the energy required to run all the data centres they plan to build at full capacity exceeds the available supply of renewable energy, according to a Bloomberg analysis of the latest available data.
 Google is not the first major technology company to cite the rapid growth of AI as an obstacle to achieving environmental goals. 
 In May, Microsoft Corp said its carbon emissions climbed 30% since 2020, as the company increasingly invested in AI. The increase made that company’s target of getting to below net-zero emissions by 2030 even harder than it was when it announced its carbon-negative goal.
 Sasha Luccioni, climate lead at startup Hugging Face Inc, said the data show tech companies weren’t anticipating the massive growth of AI when they set their environmental goals. 
 “They couldn’t have,” she said. “The baseline year in that Google report was 2019 –  definitely not anticipating it.” — Bloomberg",york google emission half company artificial intelligence core product meet goal carbon emission environmental report tech giant annual report cover google progress meeting environmental goal unit greenhouse gas emission tonne carbon dioxide equivalent company google energy consumption data centre emission chain blame push product difficult emission product emission energy demand intensity compute emission increase technical infrastructure investment google report mountain view california company eliminate emission operation generative user input spit content text image resource intensive bloomberg news investigation technology data centre power requirement dramatic increase power demand silicon valley growth cost threatens energy transition plan entire nation energy goal dollar tech company country saudi arabia ireland malaysia energy data centre capacity exceeds renewable energy bloomberg analysis data major technology company rapid growth obstacle environmental goal corp carbon emission company increase company net emission carbon negative goal sasha luccioni climate lead startup data tech company massive growth environmental goal google report bloomberg,"[(0, 0.24153635), (4, 0.3285086), (5, 0.4261295)]",5
701567,StarBiz,12,02/07/2024,China’s AI startups head to Singapore in a bid for global growth,,"Singapore: When Wu Cunsong and Chen Binghui founded their artificial intelligence (AI) startup two years ago in Hangzhou, China, they quickly ran into obstacles, including dearth of venture capital. 
 This March, they did what scores of other Chinese AI firms have done and moved their company, Tabcut, 4,023km south-west to Singapore.
 The business-friendly country offers Wu and Chen better access to global investors and customers at a time when elevated geopolitical tensions keep many US and international firms away from China. 
 Equally crucial for an AI startup, they can buy Nvidia Corp’s latest chips and other cutting-edge technologies in the politically neutral island nation, something that would have been impossible in China because of US export controls.
 “We wanted to go to a place abundant with capital for financing, rather than a place where the availability of funds is rapidly diminishing,” Wu said in an interview.
 Singapore is emerging as a favourite destination for Chinese AI startups seeking to go global. While the city-state – with an ethnic Chinese majority – has long attracted companies from China, AI entrepreneurs in particular are accelerating the shift because trade sanctions imposed by the United States on their homeland block their access to the newest technologies.
 A base in Singapore is also a way for companies to distance themselves from their Chinese origins, a move often called “Singapore-washing”. 
 That’s an attempt to reduce scrutiny from customers and regulators in countries that are China’s political opponents, such as the United States.
 The strategy doesn’t always work: Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd moved the headquarters for its TikTok business to Singapore, but the popular video service was still hit by a new US law requiring the sale or ban of its American operations over security concerns. 
 Chinese fashion giant Shein, which also moved its base to Singapore, has faced intense criticism in the United States and is now aiming to go public in London instead of New York.
 But for AI startups, more is at stake than just perception. AI companies amass large amounts of data and rely on cutting-edge chips to train their systems, and if access is restricted the quality of their product will suffer. The United States has blocked sales of the most sophisticated chips and other technologies to China, to prevent them from being used for military and other purposes. OpenAI, the American generative-AI leader, is curbing China’s access to its software tools.
 China has also taken a strict approach to AI-generated content, trying to ensure it complies with the ruling Communist Party’s policies and propaganda. 
 The country made one of the world’s first major moves to regulate nascent technology last July, asking companies to register their algorithms with the government before they roll out consumer-facing services.
 That means that AI developers “won’t be able to engage in free explorations if they are in China”, said a founder of consulting firm Linkloud, who asked to be identified only by his first name Adam because of the sensitivity of the subject. 
 He estimated that 70% to 80% of Chinese software and AI startups target customers globally, with many now choosing to skip China altogether. Linkloud is building a community for Chinese AI entrepreneurs exploring global markets.
 Singapore’s AI regulations are less stringent and it’s known for the ease of setting up a company. The country wants to be a bridge between entrepreneurs from Asia and the world, said Chan Ih-Ming, executive vice-president of the Singapore Economic Development Board.
 “Many businesses and startups, including Chinese ones, choose Singapore as their hub for South-East Asia and see Singapore as a springboard to global markets,” he said. The city-state was home to more than 1,100 AI startups at the end of 2023, he said. 
 While Singapore doesn’t disclose data by country, evidence of China-based AI companies setting up shop is mounting.
 Jianfeng Lu is a pioneer of the trend, having moved to Singapore from the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing to establish his AI startup Wiz Holdings Pte in 2019. With backing from Tiger Global, GGV Capital and Hillhouse Capital, he built its speech recognition AI engine from the ground up, and sold customer-service bots to clients in Latin America, South-East Asia and northern Africa. He didn’t sell in China, a move his fellow founders term prescient.

701571,StarBiz,13,02/07/2024,Disruptive AI set to transform industry,Beijing’s tech giants scramble to roll out own versions,"Beijing: Competition is heating up the fast-developing field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge disruptive technology that is expected to be increasingly applied to a wider range of sectors and spearhead a new round of industrial transformation and upgrade, domain experts say.
 Chinese technology companies, they said, should step up investment in improving computing power and algorithms and accumulate more high-quality training data, so as to gain an edge in the global AI race and narrow the gap with the United States in the latest tech frontier.
 Generative AI refers to computer algorithms trained with huge amounts of data capable of generating content such as images, text, audio and video in a human-like fashion. It is the key technology underpinning US-based research firm OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 The recent launch of GPT-4o, the latest large language model or LLM developed by OpenAI, has caused a global sensation. 
 New flagships
 The new flagship generative AI model surpasses the company’s existing models in visual and audio understanding, making the interaction between humans and machines much more natural and easier.
 LLMs are AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation.
 Industry insiders said the multimodal LLMs, which possess the abilities to process and generate content across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio and video, will lead the way for the further development of the generative AI industry, with significant potential for application in various industries like finance, retail, healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
 According to a report from global consultancy McKinsey & Co, generative AI will add between US$2.6 trillion and US$4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy, enhancing all sectors of industry. 
 Banking, high technology and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact from generative AI.
 Major Chinese tech heavyweights, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc, iFlytek and Tencent Holdings Ltd, are scrambling to roll out their own AI-powered LLMs and bolster the commercial use of generative AI technology.
 In May, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, unveiled Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, the latest version of its LLM, saying its capabilities have surpassed those of OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo model, the predecessor of GPT-4o.
 The Tongyi Qianwen 2.5 achieved a full upgrade with improved performance in reasoning, code comprehension and textual understanding compared with the previous version, the company said.
 In the context of Chinese language, the new model has caught up with the GPT-4 model in terms of text understanding and generation, knowledge quiz, dialogues and life advice, said Zhou Jingren, chief technology officer of Alibaba Cloud.
 Alibaba’s LLMs have been deployed by over 90,000 enterprise users in industries like consumer electronics, automobiles, education, healthcare, culture, tourism and gaming.
 “We look forward to collaborating with our customers and developers in seizing the immense growth opportunities presented by the latest surge in generative AI technology,” Zhou said, adding Alibaba Cloud will continue to contribute a diverse array of AI models to the open-source communities.
 Official data showed that the Chinese self-developed LLMs rank second in the world, and over 100 LLMs with more than one billion parameters each have been launched in China.
 Baidu said in April its LLM and ChatGPT-like chatbot Ernie Bot had garnered more than 200 million users since its debut in March 2023, while more than 85,000 enterprise clients had used Baidu’s enterprise-level LLM platform Qianfan to create 190,000 AI applications.
 Robin Li, co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Baidu, said the multimodal LLMs are key to the future development of AI technology, and this approach has been largely regarded as essential for realising artificial general intelligence or AGI, which is a theoretical AI system with capabilities that rival those of a human.
 Different emphasis
 He emphasised the biggest difference between China and some Western countries in terms of AI lies in applications, which are driving the rapid development of the AI industry in China.
 Li said in the US and Europe, everyone is trying to come up with cutting-edge foundation models. “In China, although there are hundreds of foundation models, people are increasingly talking about what the super app is for the AI age, or what is the killer app or the AI native app,” he noted. “We take more of an application-driven approach.
 “More people probably are focused on when GPT-5 will likely emerge, and what kind of new features we will be offering, but I’m more interested in what kind of application can take full advantage of the existing power of large language models.”
 Ernie 4.0, Baidu’s latest LLM, is better than the GPT-4 in Chinese because the company used a lot more Chinese data to train that model, Li said.
 Chinese AI company iFlytek announced in January that its upgraded LLM outperformed GPT-4 Turbo in metrics like language understanding and maths. For its part, eCommerce giant JD unveiled its LLM, the ChatRhino, which could be used in various fields, including retail, logistics, finance and health, as the company aims to bolster digital transformation and upgrade industries by using AI.
 Wang Peng, a researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said, “China’s major advantages in developing AI lie in abundant data resources and diversified industrial application scenarios, while the United States has taken the lead in basic AI research, chips, algorithms and other crucial technologies, as well as a sound innovation ecosystem.”
 Chinese enterprises should pool more resources to improve the quality of data that satisfy the training of LLMs, optimise algorithms, cultivate talent specialised in the field of AI and expand cooperation with leading international AI companies, Wang said.
 Lu Yanxia, research director at market research company International Data Corp (IDC) China, said Chinese tech companies’ continuous technological advancements in LLMs will further promote the popularisation of AI models, and bring fresh business opportunities for domestic AI servers, cloud computing and chip companies.
 Narrowing the gap
 She said tech enterprises should pool more resources to improve computing power, algorithms and quality of data to narrow the gap with the United States in the generative AI sector.
 The LLMs necessitate higher demand for data and knowledge in professional fields, and for talent that can fine-tune specialised models based on diverse industrial demands, she said.
 As various industries adopt the latest wave of digital transformation driven by AI, China’s spending on information and communications technology will increase by 9.8% year-on-year in 2024, surpassing the global average by two percentage points, IDC said.
 Pan Helin, a member of the Industry and Information Technology Ministry’s Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, said the training of multimodal AI models necessitates massive requirements for computing capacity, which will give a strong boost to the development of the computing  industry. — China Daily/ANN",competition field generative artificial intelligence edge disruptive technology wider range sector round industrial transformation upgrade domain expert chinese technology company investment power algorithm quality training data gain edge global race narrow gap tech generative refers computer algorithm huge amount data capable content image audio video human fashion key technology firm chatgpt launch gpt language model llm openai global sensation flagship generative model surpasses company model visual audio understanding interaction human machine natural easier llm model huge amount text data variety task natural language processing machine translation industry insider llm posse ability generate content multiple modality text image video lead development generative industry potential application industry finance retail healthcare intelligent report global consultancy generative annual global economy sector industry banking technology life science industry biggest impact generative major chinese tech heavyweight alibaba baidu iflytek tencent holding roll llm bolster commercial generative technology alibaba cloud cloud arm alibaba tongyi qianwen version llm capability openai gpt turbo model predecessor gpt tongyi qianwen upgrade performance code comprehension textual understanding previous version company chinese language model gpt model term understanding generation knowledge quiz life advice zhou jingren chief technology officer cloud alibaba llm enterprise user industry consumer electronics automobile education healthcare culture tourism customer developer immense growth opportunity generative technology zhou alibaba cloud contribute diverse array model source community official data chinese llm rank llm parameter china baidu april llm chatgpt chatbot ernie bot user march enterprise client enterprise level llm platform qianfan create application founder chairman chief executive officer baidu multimodal key future development technology approach essential artificial intelligence agi theoretical system capability human emphasis biggest difference china western country term application rapid development industry europe edge foundation model hundred foundation model people super app age killer app native app application approach people gpt emerge feature application advantage power language model baidu llm gpt chinese company lot chinese data train model chinese company iflytek january upgraded llm gpt turbo metric language understanding math giant llm chatrhino field retail logistics finance health company bolster digital transformation upgrade industry wang peng researcher academy social science major advantage lie abundant data resource industrial application scenario united lead basic chip crucial technology innovation ecosystem chinese enterprise pool resource quality data llm cultivate talent field cooperation international company yanxia director market company international data corp idc china chinese tech company continuous technological advancement llm promote popularisation model fresh business opportunity domestic server chip company gap tech pool resource power algorithm quality data narrow gap generative sector llm necessitate demand data professional field talent fine tune model diverse industrial demand industry digital transformation china spending communication technology increase global average percentage idc pan industry technology ministry expert committee communication economy multimodal model massive requirement capacity strong boost development industry daily ann,"[(2, 0.7639659), (6, 0.23428431)]",2

Ahad reported.As a result, it said Malaysian teenage girls were hooked on the app, spending hours text messaging their virtual boyfriends.
 Several of them said they enjo­y­ed their imaginary relationships as their virtual boyfriends were “always available, more romantic and understood them better”.
 A 17-year-old student, known as Alesya, said she was drawn to the app as it allowed her to choose the character of her boyfriend.
 “Also, virtual boyfriends do not judge us, unlike real boyfriends,” she said.
 Suraya, another teenager, said she used the app to chat with her favourite Korean celebrities.
 “It feels like I have a secret friend in my pocket. Although I know it is AI-generated and not real, it is not detrimental to me in any way. Most importantly, I know how to control myself,” she said.However, two parents said their daughters who were addic­ted to it showed behavioural changes since they started using the app.
 > With its reputation of being haunted, the century-old Kellie’s Castle in Batu Gajah, Perak, is attracting local visitors with a fascination for the paranormal.
 Mingguan Malaysia reported that many visitors claimed to have sighted an apparition of a woman, especially at a particular roofed balcony.
 The building’s managing director, Zamari Muhyi, said that apart from the balcony, there were three other “unnerving” locations, including the master bedroom.He said the entity would usually appear at the said balcony from 5.15pm onwards and several visitors had captured images of it.
 Zamari said the apparition was also active between midnight and 3am. He said several “experiments” conducted in the building in the past years substantiated claims of the hauntings.
 “In 2017, we explored the buil­ding for spirits with a group. A woman in the group was possessed by a spirit. Suddenly, she started speaking like a man. 
 “I asked who he was and he identified himself as Gopal, a laundry man who couldn’t return home to India. Upon his death, his spirit ended up wandering aimlessly in the building,” he said.
 > The daily also reported that Malaysians topped the list of being the most obese people in South-East Asia. This made them susceptible to premature death, non­-communicable diseases and other health conditions.
 It reported that Malaysia topped the list of nine countries followed by Thailand and Singa­pore, while the leanest people were from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.Health and dietary experts said the high obesity rate was attribu­ted to their intake of food and drinks high in sugar and calories. Other factors include the low consumption of fruits and vegetables.",application charac ter girl boyfriend artificial intelligence hundred choice celebrity result malaysian teenage girl app spending hour virtual boyfriend imaginary relationship virtual boyfriend romantic understood student alesya drawn app choose character virtual boyfriend judge real boyfriend teenager app favourite korean celebrity secret friend pocket real detrimental parent daughter behavioural app reputation century kellie castle batu gajah perak local visitor paranormal mingguan malaysia visitor apparition woman balcony building director zamari muhyi balcony unnerving location master bedroom entity balcony onwards visitor image apparition active midnight experiment building claim hauntings spirit woman spirit gopal laundry return india death spirit malaysian list obese people east asia susceptible premature death communicable health condition malaysia list country singa pore leanest people cambodia lao health dietary expert obesity rate attribu intake food drink sugar calorie factor low consumption fruit vegetable,"[(5, 0.99317086)]",5
700629,StarEdu,4,30/06/2024,AI for all,,"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), with the help of local and international artificial intelligence (AI) experts, has developed a basic structure for the curriculum that can be adopted by other institutions to create their own AI-focused curriculum.
 The varsity’s AI Faculty – a first for the country – is set to welcome the first batch of 120 Bachelor in AI degree students this October, with the number of seats to be increased over the years, said its dean Assoc Prof Dr Mohd Naz’ri Mahrin. 
 He said there are plans to offer Bachelor of AI with different specialities such as manufacturing or agriculture.
 “We need to have something that is more targeted because AI is everywhere, in every domain.This could lead to big, impactful results or change in the sector.
 “Also in the pipeline for us is a master’s degree by research and coursework, and PhD programmes in AI that we hope to offer by early next year,” he told StarEdu.
 While specialising in AI through Bachelor in Science programmes is not new in Malaysia, Mohd Naz’ri said what needs to be done now is to aggressively push, embrace and adopt AI in higher learning institutions.
 “We have been tasked to initiate this but it will be replicated by other universities later on. We will support them in developing their AI curriculum,” he said.
 Mohd Naz’ri said after Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced the establishment of the AI Faculty last year, UTM had met with then Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin to discuss its opening.
 “Mohamed Khaled (the current Defence Minister) said the government wanted more AI talent in the market. The government’s negotiations with investors and businesses also revealed that they need these talents in order to open up businesses here. In fact, it’s almost a ‘condition’ for them to invest and open shop here,” he shared.
 He said these companies want local AI manpower because it is more cost-effective.
 Globally, he added, there is a shortage of AI talent and countries like Japan are rushing to produce enough manpower to meet their industry needs.
 Malaysia alone needs about 200,000 AI talents according to the AI Roadmap 2021-2025, he said, adding that they will come from undergraduates, postgraduates and professional practices.
 While this number looks daunting, Mohd Naz’ri said the Higher Education Ministry has set up the Malaysian AI Consortium, which currently has 75 members, to be a platform for collaboration as they “cannot do this alone”.
 The consortium consists of all public universities, selected private universities that run AI-related programmes and some technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Ericsson.
 “We need to strategise and carry out this mandate together. I do not think we can do this in silos,” he added.
 Last month, Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir officiated the launch of the faculty at the UTM Kuala Lumpur campus.
 In his speech, the Higher Education Minister said Malaysia’s first Faculty of AI would lead the way in the integration and teaching of AI throughout the country amid today’s rapidly changing technology.
 Describing the faculty as “a catalyst for an integrated AI education system”, he said it showcased Malaysia’s readiness for AI transformation in higher education.
 International Islamic University of Malaysia Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Osman Bakar, who was also present at the launch on May 10, said the AI faculty should explore and come up with a code of ethics for AI professionals.
 Stressing that AI will not see the end of jobs for humans, Universiti Malaysia Kelantan Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (AIBIG) director Dr Muhammad Akmal Remli said, for the most part, it will transform the work people do.
 “We must embrace these changes or risk falling behind. This shift is not just necessary; it’s a chance to improve our educational practices. At its core, education is about more than just imparting knowledge and student development; it is about fostering humanity, skills and integrity.
 “The key is not to replace learning outcomes or content with AI but to use AI to assist in student understanding and make the learning process easier and more enjoyable,” he added.",universiti teknologi malaysia utm local international artificial intelligence expert basic structure curriculum institution curriculum varsity faculty country batch bachelor degree student seat dean assoc prof mohd naz mahrin plan bachelor speciality agriculture domain lead impactful change sector pipeline master degree coursework phd programme hope offer staredu bachelor science programme mohd naz push embrace adopt institution initiate university curriculum mohd naz prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim establishment faculty utm education minister datuk seri current defence minister government talent market government negotiation investor business talent business condition shop company local manpower cost effective talent country manpower meet industry malaysia talent roadmap undergraduate postgraduate professional practice mohd naz education ministry malaysian consortium platform collaboration consortium public university private university programme technology company microsoft ericsson strategise carry silo month datuk seri zambry abd kadir launch faculty utm kuala lumpur campus speech education minister malaysia faculty lead integration country technology faculty catalyst education system malaysia readiness transformation education international islamic university malaysia emeritus prof datuk osman bakar launch faculty explore code ethic professional job human universiti malaysia kelantan institute artificial intelligence data aibig director muhammad akmal remli transform people risk shift chance educational practice education student development humanity skill integrity key outcome content assist student process enjoyable,"[(5, 0.77167743), (6, 0.2246052)]",5
700631,StarEdu,5,30/06/2024,AI-ding online learning,,"ONLINE learning – especially student outcomes – will benefit greatly from artificial intelligence (AI).
 OpenLearning.com founder and chief executive officer Adam Brimo said generative AI (GenAI) can be used to solve issues, such as learning design, that have been plaguing online learning platforms.
 “Educators and software designers are now trying to ‘morph software’ to create online lesson modules.
 “We have these ideas of what we want but the platform doesn’t support it so we are always trying to find a way to work around it,” he said, adding that now with AI, online learning providers are able to better design and customise lessons for different student outcomes.“You can tell ChatGPT 4 that ‘this course is going to be a learning based credit course’ or ‘I want my outcome to be structured on Bloom’s Taxonomy or socio-emotional learning’.
 “With AI, we can contextualise and develop content suited to the application in a way we couldn’t before,” Brimo said, adding that it is also now possible to build courses and programmes that deliver much better outcomes.
 He said over the past year, OpenLearning.com has built a range of tools specifically focused on how to implement best practices by having AI act as a “virtual learning designer”.Singapore Education Network founder and managing director Michael Klemm said there is a need to have structured training and implementation of digital tools for educators, both in school and in higher learning institutions.
 “In universities, the biggest obstacle is that teachers and educators don’t have enough time for professional learning or there’s no incentive to do so.
 “Universities need to use the technology and make it easily accessible and really user-friendly,” he said, adding that any initiative taken to use AI is usually the result of an educator’s own efforts.
 Brimo and Klemm were among the panellists of the Times Higher Education (THE) Asia Universities Summit 2024 held from April 29 to May 1 at Sunway University.

700781,Main,12,30/06/2024,AI scams targeting travellers,"Govt intervention needed in regulating OTAs, Airbnb operators","PETALING JAYA: Stronger regulation and protection is needed with the alarming rise of scams powered by artificial intelligence (AI) targeting hoteliers and travellers, say industry players.
 Malaysia Budget & Business Hotel Association president Dr Sri Ganesh Michiel said although such cases are rare in Malaysia following close cooperation between hoteliers and online travel agencies (OTA), it is still a cause for concern.
 He highlighted the urgent need for government intervention in regulating OTAs, including Airbnb operators, many of which are based overseas.
 “There must be clear procedures for collecting personal information for domestic and international travel bookings to thwart fake reservations, fictitious accommodations, and phishing schemes facilitated through malicious APK downloads and external links.
 “For example, one should not be allowed to register or make a booking using fake names before verifying his identity.
 “Regulation is crucial to prevent data abuse and ensure customer safety. Measures like strict policies on links and two-step identifications are being implemented by Booking.com to enhance security.
 “There is a need for laws and regulations to control online platforms and consumer behaviour,” he said.
 A report by the chief information security officer of a leading online travel website, Booking.com has noted a sharp rise in global phishing attacks targeting the hospitality sector.
 Using AI, it said scammers create realistic emails to trick people into divulging sensitive data like credit cards or personal information.
 “For Booking.com to raise the alarm, it means it’s a dangerous trend, as AI can learn and get smarter.
 “The platform’s warning underscores the evolving capabilities of AI and the diverse methods perpetrators can exploit to deceive and compromise individuals making travel bookings,” Sri Ganesh said in an interview yesterday.
 He noted that except for some individual operators, hoteliers in Malaysia have been working closely with travel platforms like Booking.com and Traveloka and it has helped to address issues effectively.
 “The coordination and sharing of information among industry stakeholders have improved to prevent and mitigate scams.
 “We are always taught the latest trends and tactics and how to spot possibly fraudulent emails before clicking on any link.”
 Malaysian Association of Hotels president Datin Christina Toh said that smaller players may be more vulnerable to scams as large international chains have the tech and cybersecurity support systems in place to handle these challenges.
 “Nonetheless, these companies usually have mechanisms to detect and prevent such incidents, including working with their system providers.
 “Hotels usually work collaboratively with platforms like Booking.com to identify and address such issues.
 “That’s why frequent training and education of hotel staff on the telltale signs of scams is a regular practice to strengthen defences,” she said.
 Toh noted that the rapid response capabilities of OTAs are vital in managing these problems, making close cooperation between OTAs and hoteliers essential for maintaining online security and trust in the industry.
 Such support is crucial to helping these smaller entities manage and potentially circumvent cyber threats effectively,” she said.
 Malaysian Tourism Federation president Datuk Tan Kok Liang recommended proactive steps for travel operators to protect against AI-enabled phishing scams such as providing employee education and training.
 “Customers should also be informed about potential scams and taught how to verify the authenticity of communications from the business,” he added.  Tan said that establishing secure communication channels is also critical to safeguarding business interactions, and installing robust cybersecurity tools would also help protect against digital threats.
 “Finally, conducting regular security audits will help identify and address vulnerabilities, enhancing safety and confidence in online transactions,” he said.",jaya stronger regulation protection rise scam artificial intelligence hotelier traveller industry player budget business hotel association president sri ganesh michiel rare malaysia close cooperation hotelier travel agency concern urgent government intervention otas airbnb operator overseas procedure personal domestic international travel booking fake reservation fictitious accommodation malicious apk downloads external link register fake name identity regulation crucial prevent data abuse customer safety measure strict policy step identification enhance security law regulation online platform consumer report chief security officer online travel sharp rise global phishing attack hospitality sector scammer realistic email trick people sensitive data credit card personal booking raise dangerous trend smarter platform warning underscore capability diverse method perpetrator deceive compromise individual booking ganesh interview yesterday individual operator hotelier travel platform traveloka issue industry stakeholder prevent mitigate scam trend tactic fraudulent email link malaysian association hotel president datin christina toh player vulnerable scam international chain cybersecurity support system handle challenge company detect prevent incident system provider hotel address issue frequent education hotel staff telltale sign scam regular practice strengthen defence rapid response capability vital close cooperation hotelier essential online security trust industry support crucial entity circumvent cyber threat malaysian tourism federation president datuk tan kok liang proactive step travel operator scam employee education training customer potential scam verify authenticity communication business secure communication channel critical safeguarding business interaction robust cybersecurity tool digital threat regular security audit address vulnerability safety confidence online transaction,"[(2, 0.12449773), (4, 0.8723142)]",4
700467,Main,14,29/06/2024,Will AI-based teaching systems replace human teachers?,,"WITH the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the education sector is experiencing unprecedented changes. As AI applications in teaching become increasingly widespread, some are asking if AI teaching can coexist with human teaching. Will it replace traditional teaching methods, or can it complement them to enhance education quality?
 Among the benefits AI can offer is personalised instruction based on a student’s learning progress, automatically adjusting the content to pace the student. Also, AI teaching systems can operate around the clock, allowing students access anytime and anywhere, which is challenging to achieve with traditional teaching.
 However, I believe human teachers play a role in education that cannot be entirely replaced. Teachers are not just transmitters of knowledge; they are guides to and supporters of a student’s growth. Through interaction with students, teachers can inspire interest in learning, cultivate critical thinking and foster creativity – tasks that I think AI would find difficult to accomplish. Moreover, teachers can offer emotional support, helping students overcome learning obstacles and confusion.
 I think AI teaching and human teaching can form a complementary relationship rather than one replacing the other. AI can handle repetitive and mechanical tasks, reducing the workload on teachers and allowing them more time to engage with students. 
 For instance, in language learning, AI can use speech recognition and natural language processing technology to help students practise listening and speaking, enhancing learning efficiency. And human teachers can engage in discussions and interactions, helping students understand cultural contexts and nuances, making learning more profound.
 Additionally, in massive open online courses (MOOCs), AI can automatically grade assignments and tests, providing instant feedback, while teachers can facilitate indepth discussions and interactions through online forums and video conferences.
 I believe the coexistence of AI teaching and human teaching is the future trend in education development. We should fully utilise the advantages of AI technology while also valuing and leveraging the irreplaceable role of human teachers in education. Only in this way can we achieve a comprehensive improvement in education quality and cultivate more innovative and well-rounded talents.

700571,StarBiz 7,5,29/06/2024,Raging debate over the pros and cons of AI,,"THE world is in a mess, and the acceleration of artificial Intelligence (AI) usage is disrupting every business and the way we live. 
 We are all struggling to understand what the AI transition means for each of us as consumers, parents, teachers, businesses or government leaders. 
 The debate over the pros and cons of AI is raging, especially in its dual military-civilian usage. AI will guide the next drone or missile at you with faster accuracy than ever imagined. 
 It can also develop the next miracle drug to change our health. We simply do not know what the outcome whether AI is ultimately good or bad – only that the bandwidth of risk and opportunity is widening at frightening speed. 
 We have never seen technology being adopted in daily activities in terms of speed, scale and scope as AI. The AI revolution has pushed the Nvidia and other AI platform stock valuations into the trillion-dollar league. 
 Big powers and big platforms are all investing in AI, trying to figure out how to beat the competitors in achieving scale and domination. 
 The digital divide means that those who are ahead in AI will be richer, faster, smarter and more powerful, whereas those who don’t implement AI tools are being marginalised.   
 Clearly, the rich and advanced economies stand to gain more from AI and technology, whereas emerging and developing market economies are still struggling on how to use AI to help them develop or at the minimum, tackle their myriad problems of people and planetary injustices. 
 The most obvious benefit of AI is that it could improve productivity, which has declined globally across the board for several decades. 
 McKinsey research suggests human-centric generative AI adoption may well automate up to 30% of business activities across occupations by 2030.   
 Analysing 63 user cases, they estimated that generative AI could add roughly US$2.6 trillion to US$4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, equivalent to adding 2.5% to 4.2% to current global gross domestic product, which has been forecast by the World Bank to slow down to half the growth before the global crisis in 2008. 
 The potential for turning around development in multi-directions using AI looks huge. How can this be achieved?
 AI is essentially a human-invented tool for learning and using for change. 
 Given the right amount of data, it can help make better decisions and eliminate inefficiencies in the system.   It can also do bad things at scale. 
 Ethics in the usage of AI is at the heart of the current debate. In the wrong hands, AI is what historian Yuval Noah Harari calls “data colonisation and digital dictatorship”. 
 Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz propounded that the job of governments was to create a learning (knowledge) society, since knowledge is a public good. 
 Fellow Nobel Laureate Robert Solow (1924-2023) first quantitatively identified that the most important determinant of economic growth was technological change. 
 Kenneth Arrow (1921-2017) showed that markets by themselves do not yield efficiency in the production and dissemination of knowledge. 
 More recent case studies on building tech ecosystems showed that learning is really about copying or imitating global knowledge and adapting these to local needs. 
 South Korean Professors Kim and Lee (2022) showed that Taipei and Shenzhen evolved into tech powerhouses by first importing foreign technology through welcoming multinational companies and then developing local champions that increased research and development, primarily in process engineering, and then moving to original ideas, products and services that began to rival foreign competitors. 
 In short, human learning is always about copying others and then personalising or internalising such knowledge to create new ideas and actions.  
 This “copy-learn-adapt-innovate-scale” approach is exactly the path that AI usage is following. 
 When we face something totally new, we have four essential choices. The first is to deny or reject because we fear the unknown. The second for those who are curious is to learn and experiment. The third is to do nothing or simply follow the crowd, because that appears to be the safest way out of disruptive change. The brave and risk-takers are those who decide to leap into the unknown and become innovative or entrepreneurs. These become the change agents. 
 In today’s existential threats of nuclear war, ecological collapse and technological disruption, doing nothing or business-as-usual is not an option. You either eat lunch or become lunch. 
 There is no complacency shown in the financial sector, with the Bank of International Settlements and  Citigroup Inc recently warning about the profound impact and opportunities and threats of AI on the financial landscape. 
 The amount of startups working on implementing AI in different domains is staggering.  In 2023, close to US$315bil was invested in tech companies globally, a large chunk being in AI applications. 
 The World Economic Forum (WEF) has been promoting application of AI in social innovation to tackle social and ecological issues. Although the WEF report stressed that “Artificial intelligence has the potential to scale impact in several domains but requires collaboration to help social innovators realise its maximum potential”, the greatest barriers to successful AI implementation are lack of trust, partnerships and funding. 
 The pattern in adopting AI in every domain, from personal to communities, businesses and government is common.  You must approach change from a complex system perspective, noting that there are no simple one-size-fit-all solutions. 
 Change management is not rocket science - it is about changing mindsets, addressing vested interests, and having the passion and management skills to execute change. 
 An excellent Japanese study on regulation shows that 20% of staff time are spent on compliance issues, so that small and medium enterprises face overwhelming costs and barriers to deal with daily regulatory and bureaucratic issues. Just simplifying overlapping silos in bureaucracies using AI tools could increase productivity by 8%. 
 In sum, we all need to adopt AI tools to generate the productivity that is needed to achieve more with less. Although change is best tackled bottom-up, it needs leadership, courage and passion to engineer change. That takes human intelligence, with AI as a tool, but impactful change is never about one individual, but about the whole and all of us.

 AI will make data centres more efficient, helping them represent a smaller share of future power demand, he said in a Bloomberg TV interview. 
 Gates said the technology may one day use as much as 6% of global electricity – more than the estimated 2% today – but felt estimates above 10% were wrong. 
 His comments come after AI has received increased scrutiny amid expectations that it will dramatically raise energy needs. 
 In some parts of the world, demand from data centres is already outstripping the available power supply, a trend which threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations. 
 Gates countered the additional demand from electric cars, heat pumps, and green steel manufacturing will all “dwarf even this amazing demand for data centres now.”

700017,StarBiz,12,28/06/2024,Micron selloff shows risk of sky-high AI expectations,,"New York: Micron Technology Inc’s post-results selloff sent a fresh reminder to global investors about the risks inherent in bets on artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakers.
 Days after leading AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp slumped by nearly half a trillion US dollars, Micron shares fell about 8% in extended trading after the memory maker offered a forecast that fell short of the highest estimates. 
 In a sign of the extreme volatility in AI-related stocks, Micron’s news also triggered drops in South Korea’s two biggest companies, Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc, as fellow memory chip providers feeding the AI supply chain.
 Micron is one of the many companies that have gotten a lift from the mania for AI-related stocks, as its high-bandwidth memory is a candidate for use alongside Nvidia’s industry-leading chips for training large language models. 
 Its shares had more than doubled in the year prior to its Wednesday report, but even with an outlook roughly in line with the average of analyst estimates the company was punished for not outperforming elevated expectations.
 “The market is holding totally unrealistic expectations, as many names who are beating street estimates by a wide margin are still being sold down,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors Pte in Singapore.
 “But I think the street is very well aware of the fact that these US names are pretty overcooked. Too many paper hands chasing the fast easy money.”
 Momentum in the global AI frenzy took a hit earlier this week when Nvidia shares entered correction territory on Monday before bouncing back. 
 A global gauge tracking semiconductor shares fell about 5% since reaching an all-time high earlier this month.
 For businesses like Micron, whose traditional output of supplying memory for PCs, smartphones and more conventional data centre use is still recovering from a slump last year, that means a great degree of share price uncertainty.
 The US memory maker’s briefing fell short of what SK Hynix offered earlier, when it announced its High Bandwidth Memory production capacity is largely sold out through 2025, said Tom Kang, director at Counterpoint Research. 
 Micron lacks the strong position in AI SK Hynix enjoys or in the broader memory industry that Samsung has, he added.
 “This brings a reality check to the AI sector, which looks bubblish,” Kang said.
 The relentless rally in US mega caps that are seen as benefiting from AI has pushed their shares to historically high valuations.

699615,Lifestyle,3,27/06/2024,K-pop industry leverages on AI,,"THE K-pop industry has begun using artificial intelligence in making music videos and songs for K-pop artistes in line with technological advancements.
 K-pop boy band Seventeen, for instance, introduced the music video for its latest song, Maestro, last month with a scene created by AI.
 The music video makes its viewers question who is the real maestro, when the subject responsible for creation is unclear, in a world where virtually everything can be made with AI.
 Seventeen’s Woozi, who has produced various hit singles for the group, said during a press conference introducing the group’s 17 Is Right Here album in Seoul last month, that he has experience experimenting with AI while creating music.
 “We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it. 
 “Through these experiments, we discovered the strengths and weaknesses of composing music with AI,” said Woozi. 
 “We also contemplate how to protect our musical identity in this world where AI can create music,” he said.
 Girl group Aespa also used AI in the music video for its latest song, Supernova, the lead track of its LP released on May 27.
 In the music video, there is a close-up scene in which Aespa members are singing, with  only their mouths moving unnaturally.
 “We did not expect such a scene. This got us thinking about AI as these days, cover songs created by AI are popular on social media. 
 “But I still think AI cannot perfectly imitate a person’s facial expression or emotions,” said Ningning of Aespa during a press conference introducing its first LP in Seoul on May 27.
 SM founder and former chief producer Lee Soo-man also spoke about the applications of AI in K-pop during his keynote speech at the General Assembly of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers in Seoul on May 30.
 “AI will help K-pop connect with its fans around the world. 
 “It’s a convergence of culture and technology that I’ve been talking about for a while now, and it will allow deeper engagement between celebrities and ‘prosumers’, or fans,” Lee said.
 In May 2023, singer Lee Hyun re-debuted as Midnatt, an alter ego created through AI technology, under Hybe.
 Midnatt released single Masquerade, featuring a female voice generated with AI using the male singer’s own voice.
 The song was also released in six languages – Korean, English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish – using the multilanguage transformation technology of Supertone, a sound AI startup acquired by Hybe in 2021.

698631,Lifestyle,4,24/06/2024,Era of AI smartphone,AI takes  centre stage as tech giants unveil radical updates to transform our smartphones  this year.,"EVERY year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, such as cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. 
 This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are  focusing on reinventing our phones  with artificial intelligence.
 At its annual software developer  conference, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. 
 The new tools include a revamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an AI system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles, and craft responses to text messages and emails.
 Apple’s news followed Google’s Android announcements last month, which included an AI system that automatically summarises audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam, and helps students with homework.
 Because AI tech is still new, it’s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. 
 The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages – also known as  the green bubble. 
 Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to  communicate for more than a decade.
 As Apple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android, here’s what to know about how our smartphones will change.
 Siri gets brain transplant
 Apple said it had completely reworked Siri, its 13-year-old virtual assistant.
 The assistant will soon be powered by Apple Intelligence, the company’s version of a “large language model”. 
 That type of AI technology uses statistics and complex algorithms to guess what words belong together, similar to the autocomplete feature on your phone. 
 It’s the same type of underlying technology we’ve seen powering chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Apple said its system was more private than others’ because people’s data would remain on their iPhones.
 The upgrade will make Siri capable of processing the context of a conversation, and allow users to speak more naturally with the virtual assistant. For instance, you could say, “What’s the weather in Santa Cruz? Oh wait, I meant San Francisco” followed by “Schedule a coffee meeting there tomorrow at 9am”.
 The new and more capable Siri will also be able to handle more complex tasks, such as searching your photo album for an image of your driver’s licence and pulling the ID number to paste into a form, Apple said.
 In contrast, the old version of Siri could react only to a database of  commands and questions it was  programmed to understand, such as “What’s the weather in San Francisco?” and “Schedule a coffee meeting in San Francisco.”
 Apple Intelligence will also enable iPhone users to automatically generate images inside messages, Apple said. For instance, if you wish a friend a happy birthday, the AI could review your photo album for an image of that friend, after which it could generate an avatar of that person with balloons.
 The AI will also be usable in writing apps such as Mail and Notes. Users can highlight text for proofreading or rewriting in a different style. Inside the Safari web browser, users can also highlight articles to generate short summaries.
 Apple said it had formed a partnership with OpenAI so that Siri could tap into ChatGPT for help with tasks like generating a list of recipe ideas.
 The AI features are arriving only on the newest, fastest iPhones, including  the iPhone 15 Pro.
 Overhauling Android with Gemini
 Only owners of Google’s Pixel phones can use most of Google’s latest AI features; support for other Android devices is expected later this year.
 For the past year, Google has let users test Gemini, its new AI assistant, which requires downloading an app. (By default, Android phones will still come loaded with Google Assistant, the virtual assistant that is similar to Amazon’s Alexa and the older version of Siri.) Similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Gemini acts like a chatbot that generates responses to whatever prompt you throw at it, including “write a poem about dogs in San Francisco”.
 A new version of Gemini, called Nano, focuses on handling AI tasks directly on Pixel phones rather than processing the requests on Google’s servers, for privacy purposes.
 One feature for scam detection involves using AI to listen to your phone calls. If the conversation fits the pattern of a scam, such as a fraudster asking for your online banking password, an alert is sent to your phone.
 Another feature, called Circle to Search, lets users circle an image to ask Google for information. This feature has now been expanded to let students circle a maths or physics problem for help. Google’s AI will then generate a list of steps on how to solve the problem.
 Gemini Nano can also take a transcript automatically generated from an audio recording and create written summaries, which could be useful for meetings. Another tool, called Magic Compose, can be used inside Google’s Messages app to quickly rewrite a message in a different style.
 Improvements to texting
 For more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have confronted the green versus blue bubble divide. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
 Apple is finally taking a step towards bridging that divide. It said that in iOS 18, its messages app would adopt Rich Communication Services, a standard that Google and others integrated into their apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will be of higher quality.
 The result will probably be profound. Many iPhone and Android users said they felt discouraged from sending messages to one another because the image quality was poor. The Justice Department, which earlier this year accused Apple of placing restrictions on its phones to maintain a monopoly, viewed the messaging incompatibility as a pressure tactic to persuade people to buy iPhones. – The New York Times",apple google major software feature smartphones cosmetic overhaul screen stronger privacy protection tool radical company phone artificial intelligence annual software developer conference apple host enhancement io system iphones tool version voice assistant siri easier talk system generate image summary article response text message apple news google android announcement month system audio transcript phone conversation scam student homework tech unclear improvement mass school text message green bubble apple software standard iphone user quality message issue difficult people decade apple google release free software io android smartphones brain transplant apple siri virtual assistant assistant apple intelligence company version language model type technology statistic complex algorithm guess autocomplete feature phone type technology chatbots chatgpt google gemini apple system private people remain iphones upgrade siri capable context conversation user virtual assistant instance weather santa cruz wait san francisco schedule coffee meeting tomorrow capable siri handle complex task photo album image driver licence paste form apple contrast version siri react database question understand weather san francisco schedule coffee meeting san francisco apple intelligence enable iphone user image message apple instance friend happy birthday review photo album image friend generate avatar person balloon usable apps mail note user text proofreading style safari web browser user article short summary apple partnership openai siri tap chatgpt task list recipe idea feature fastest iphones iphone pro android gemini owner pixel phone feature android device google user gemini assistant default android phone google assistant virtual assistant amazon alexa version siri chatgpt gemini chatbot generates response throw write poem dog san francisco version gemini nano focus task phone request server purpose scam detection phone call conversation pattern scam fraudster online banking password alert phone feature circle search user image google feature student circle math physic generate list step gemini nano transcript audio create summary meeting tool compose google message rewrite message style improvement decade smartphone user green versus blue bubble divide iphone user text iphones message tap exclusive perk emojis animation user text user bubble green feature photo video deteriorate quality apple divide io message rich communication service standard google text iphones android green image quality result iphone android user message image quality poor justice department apple restriction phone monopoly messaging incompatibility pressure tactic persuade people iphones york time,"[(2, 0.9975904)]",2
697541,StarBiz,4,21/06/2024,What an innovative Japanese AI unicorn can teach Silicon Valley,,"SILICON Valley’s “move fast and break things” mantra propelled tech innovation for the Internet age.
 In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it should take a leaf out of Japan’s playbook and slow down.
 A rush to deploy AI tools to the public has resulted in embarrassing blunders, from an AI-powered Google search feature recently recommending glue on pizza, to consequences that can impact real people’s livelihoods, like the technology behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT showing signs of racial bias when ranking job applicants, as a Bloomberg analysis found.
 It has also led to tech companies consuming enormous amounts of energy to power AI. The International Energy Agency estimates the total electricity consumption for data centres across the globe will be roughly equivalent to the power demand of Japan in 2026.
 Other forecasters said that by 2030, these centres are on course to use more energy than India, the world’s most populous country. Large language models, the technology underpinning the latest crop of generative AI tools, require gargantuan troves of data and training them takes immense amounts of computing power and energy.
 As the tech continues to develop, many AI firms think the key to growth is to make these large language models even larger. 
 Some US tech titans including Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates and OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman are even backing nuclear energy firms to help power AI data centres. But there are other options beyond rushing to fire up new nuclear reactors to train AI models.
 Tokyo-based startup Sakana AI – which Nikkei Asia reported on June 15 will become the fastest-ever Japanese company to achieve unicorn status – has taken a different approach. When it comes to the most consequential technology of our time, it’s playing the long game.
 Sakana, which means fish in Japanese, was created last year by David Ha, Ren Ito and Llion Jones with the goal of applying nature-inspired ideas such as evolution and collective intelligence to create AI models, and not gobbling up as much energy as possible to train a single AI model.
 Jones, notably, co-authored the seminal 2017 research paper while at Google that underpins the technology of today’s most popular AI products, including ChatGPT, and spurred much of the current boom.
 Ha told me that much of the issues facing AI stem from companies prematurely deploying the technology in search of short-term profits, while disregarding the high energy toll.
 While Sakana’s technology could be used to create a virtual girlfriend chatbot now, it’s more focused on researching ways to apply AI to solve real-world issues. 
 This is in line with other Japan-based AI companies the West may have never heard of, such as Preferred Networks, which is trying to develop more energy-efficient AI chips.
 Silicon Valley needs to start playing the more long game, too. The world doesn’t need more useless chatbots that generate bad poetry – or perpetuate racist biases at scale – while consuming unsustainable swaths of resources. This way of thinking could have also spared some of the embarrassing headlines that have turned much of the public against embracing AI for good.
 Sakana’s most recent research is looking at new ways of producing AI models that don’t require extensive amounts of energy, and it has longer-term ambitions of helping Japan at a national scale come up with real solutions to some of its most pressing issues, including a looming labour crunch. 
 Its mission has received support from the Japanese government.
 In Japan, depopulation and a shrinking workforce have led to a public and private sector ecosystem that seeks to embrace the emerging technology’s possibilities with curiosity and hope instead of despair. 
 There is a sense of urgency around the idea that these tools can help solve labour shortages – with less of the existential fears that they will end up replacing human workers.
 Microsoft Japan president Miki Tsusaka touted generative AI’s power to accelerate growth in a nation with an ageing population in an interview with Bloomberg TV earlier this week. Her comments come on the heels of Microsoft announcing it will spend some US$2.9bil, its biggest-ever investment in Japan, to increase cloud computing and AI infrastructure.
 Along with Microsoft, OpenAI opened its first Asia office in Tokyo this spring, while Oracle Corp pledged to put more than US$8bil over the next 10 years into cloud computing and AI. — Bloomberg

697221,StarBiz,14,20/06/2024,US seeks help to curb China’s AI chip progress,Washington to ask allies to impose fresh restrictions,"WASHINGTON: A senior American official is set to visit Japan and the Netherlands to ask the two countries to add fresh restrictions on China’s semiconductor sector, including on its ability to make the high-end memory chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).
 US Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez will press his counterparts in Tokyo and The Hague to put more limits on the activities in China of Dutch supplier ASML Holding NV and Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd, according to people familiar with the matter. 
 Estevez’s requests, part of an ongoing dialogue with allies, will highlight Chinese chip factories developing so-called high-bandwidth memory chips, said the people, asking not to be identified because the discussions were private.
 ASML and Tokyo Electron machines are used to produce dynamic random access memory dies, which are stacked together to make high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. 
 Chinese companies working on HBM chips include Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of China’s leading memory chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, according to China’s corporate data provider Qichacha. 
 Huawei Technologies Co and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc are also reportedly developing HBM. 
 The Biden administration has tried for years to limit China’s ability to buy and produce advanced semiconductors, arguing such steps are necessary for national security. 
 Yet results have been mixed, with Huawei and others making significant advances. 
 The US is seeking support from allies, who have implemented their own less stringent controls, to create a more effective global blockade.
 “The United States is the most critical player in the global semiconductor equipment industry, but it’s far from the only country that matters” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Centre for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. 
 “Japan and the Netherlands are also key providers of semiconductor equipment. The Netherlands and Japan have restrictions on exports but not on servicing, and that’s a critical limitation in the overall technology controls architecture.”
 Estevez is expected to repeat a standing US request for the two countries to tighten restrictions on ASML and Tokyo Electron’s ability to maintain and repair their other advanced equipment in China as well, the people said. 
 The United States has already imposed such restrictions on American rivals, such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp. 
 The US delegation’s visit to the Netherlands is expected to take place after the new Dutch cabinet is sworn in the first week of July. 
 Reinette Klever of far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party is set to become the Foreign Trade and Development Aid Minister, a role that typically oversees the country’s export control policies. 
 The Dutch and Japanese governments have been resisting the US pressure, people familiar with the matter said earlier. The two countries want more time to evaluate the impact of current export bans on high-end chip-making equipment and to see the outcome of the US presidential election in November. 
 It is uncertain how the new Dutch government led by Wilders will react to US demands for additional measures. 
 Klever is co-founder of a far-right TV channel Ongehoord Nederland, which stirred controversy for its pro-Russian reporting and climate change scepticism. 
 The outgoing Foreign Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher paid a farewell visit to the United States last week to lobby for the interests of ASML. 
 Dutch King Willem-Alexander joined Schreinemacher in a meeting with New York governor Kathy Hochul.
 A representative of the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. 
 A spokesperson for the Dutch foreign trade ministry declined to comment. Japan’s Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
 HBM chips are an indispensable part of the AI hardware ecosystem because they speed up access to memory, helping AI development. 
 AI accelerators, made by Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, need to be bundled with HBM chips for them to work. 
 US officials are having early-stage conversations about restricting the export of HBM chips, Bloomberg has reported.
 SK Hynix Inc is the leading producer of HBM chips, with Samsung Electronics Co and US-based Micron Technology Inc pressing to catch up. 
 SK Hynix relies on equipment from ASML and Tokyo Electron, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain data. 
 South Korean equipment makers, including Hanmi Semiconductor Co and Hanwha Precision Machinery Co, also play a critical role in the HBM supply chain. 
 Earlier this year, Washington asked Seoul to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News reported. 
 Chinese companies can no longer buy the most advanced AI chips from Nvidia, but Huawei is developing its own AI accelerators, called Ascend. 
 It is unclear which company or companies are providing advanced memory chips to Huawei. 
 SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron all stopped supplying Huawei with chips after the US tightened sanctions against the Chinese company in 2020. 
 Washington officials have also grown worried about China’s own progress in chip making equipment. 
 Lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bipartisan bill to ban companies that receive US funding for chip factories from purchasing Chinese tools for those facilities.  — Bloomberg",washington senior american official visit japan country fresh restriction semiconductor sector ability memory chip artificial intelligence secretary commerce industry security estevez press counterpart hague limit activity dutch supplier japan tokyo electron people familiar matter estevez request dialogue ally chinese chip factory bandwidth memory chip people identified discussion private asml tokyo electron machine dynamic random access memory bandwidth memory hbm chip chinese company chip xinxin semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary china memory chipmaker yangtze memory technology corporate data provider qichacha huawei technology memory technology biden administration limit ability advanced semiconductor step national security mixed huawei advance support ally stringent control effective global blockade critical player global semiconductor equipment industry country matter gregory allen director centre technology strategic international study key provider equipment japan restriction export critical limitation technology estevez repeat request country restriction tokyo electron ability repair advanced equipment china people imposed restriction american rival material corp delegation visit netherlands dutch cabinet week july reinette klever lawmaker geert wilder party foreign trade development aid minister role country export control policy japanese government resisting pressure people familiar matter country time evaluate impact current export ban chip equipment presidential election uncertain dutch government wilder demand additional measure founder channel ongehoord nederland controversy pro russian reporting climate change scepticism foreign trade minister schreinemacher united week lobby asml dutch king willem alexander schreinemacher meeting york governor kathy hochul representative commerce department bureau industry security comment spokesperson foreign trade ministry comment japan economy trade industry ministry respond request hbm chip indispensable hardware ecosystem access memory development accelerator corp micro device hbm chip official conversation export chip bloomberg hynix producer hbm chip electronics micron technology catch hynix relies equipment tokyo electron bloomberg supply chain data south korean equipment maker hanmi semiconductor hanwha precision machinery play critical role hbm supply chain washington seoul restrict flow equipment technology memory chip bloomberg news chinese company advanced chip huawei accelerator unclear company company advanced memory chip hynix samsung micron huawei chip sanction chinese company washington official worried china progress chip equipment lawmaker bipartisan bill ban company chip factory chinese tool facility,"[(0, 0.99738437)]",0
694401,Main,12,17/06/2024,Can AI aid language learning?,,"THE use of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform teaching and learning processes, making them more efficient, personalised, and engaging.
 In language teaching and learning, there are many ways to utilise AI to enhance and improve the process of teaching and learning. However, with it comes sets of challenges and criticisms that must be taken into consideration.
 AI can make life easy in some ways, so much so that students may become overly reliant on it, hindering their ability to think critically and solve problems independently. This is where the role of the educator is crucial.
 We need to emphasise that AI is just a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional learning methods. We have to encourage students to use AI for idea-searching, practice, and feedback, and we must also engage them in activities that require critical thinking and human interaction, such as group discussions and debates.
 Using AI excessively might reduce face-to-face interaction and the development of interpersonal skills. Some students might be more comfortable using AI compared with having face-to-face brainstorming sessions and discussions. As educators, we need to balance AI-based activities with collaborative projects and classroom interactions. AI should be used to speed up some parts of teaching and learning activities so that the extra time can be used for more meaningful, interactive teaching moments rather than replacing human interaction.
 There is also the fact that AI-based programs can sometimes provide incorrect information, leading to misinformation being spread or students using wrong information in their work. As bad as this seems, it can actually be a teachable moment for our students. Aside from teaching students how to use AI in finding accurate information, we can also teach students to critically evaluate AI responses and cross-check information with reliable sources. This is a crucial skill for them not just in their studies but also in the world outside academia, especially in interacting with social media. We can also discuss the limitations of AI and the importance of recognising false information.
 Among the popular criticisms of the use of AI in language classrooms is that the interactions might be impersonal and less engaging compared with human interactions – ie “like talking to a robot” type of interactions. This is concerning, especially in language classrooms where authentic and genuine interactions are vital in developing students’ language abilities, especially listening and speaking skills.
 To mediate this, we should teach our students to use AI only for specific tasks where it excels, such as grammar checks or vocabulary practices, and reserve more personal and engaging activities, like discussions and debates, for human interaction.
 The integration of AI in education, including ESL (English as a Second Language) classrooms, presents significant opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning experiences. By proactively addressing the challenges AI brings and maintaining a balance between technology and human interaction, educators can utilise AI to create a more personalised, efficient, and engaging educational ecosystem.
 Our students are the students of this era; therefore, the old ways might prove less efficient for them. Educators nowadays have to be ready to change their ways for the better. There is no place to be stubborn and too hung up on the old ways and ideas in teaching and learning. As writer and futurist Alvin Toffler said, “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”

693691,StarBiz 7,5,15/06/2024,Can Generative AI unlock productivity and growth?,,"IF you watched Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang’s remarkable presentation at Taipei Computex last month, you would be convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new Industrial Revolution, in which accelerated computing with the latest AI chips unleashed the power of doing everything faster, more efficient with less energy.  
 In this age of intense global rivalry and competition, including military power, AI, robotics and improved engineering promises a techno-utopian way to achieve dominance over rivals.   
 McKinsey estimated that Generative AI’s impact on productivity could add between US$2.6 trillion and US$4.4 trillion to the global economy annually. That’s like adding one UK economy to the global economy every year.  
 Roughly three-fourths of productivity will come from business improvements in four areas – customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and research and development (R&D). 
 Think about it, instead of training everyone to learn coding, we bypass coding because AI can actually translate what you would like done through writing the script, creating the video, and even designing the process. Just ask ChatGPT’s latest version.  
 The machine has the answers, but ultimately it is the human being who will either execute what is needed, or just not do anything.  
 The reality is that even though Generative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors such as retail, banking, high tech and life sciences, whether the productivity (measured as output per capita) is achieved depends on how individuals, companies, communities and nations are driving the productivity change.   
 Since Generative AI changes the way we work by automating many individual activities, this is a social and political question. 
 Cross-border language barriers are removed when AI can do the automatic translation, print the transcript and even indicate the next work agenda.
 Since McKinsey estimates that current Generative AI and other technologies can automate work activities by as much as 60% to 70% of present employee time, no wonder many in the workforce fear AI adoption with huge resistance and reluctance to change.     
 The latest European Union (EU) Competitiveness and Industry Benchmarking Report 2024 indicates how at the high level, the EU realises that the region is racing against the clock as its industry has been continuously losing ground on global markets in terms of market share.
 EU companies are becoming less relevant and its future technological leadership is at risk. 
 The reason is obvious to all – EU’s market is much more fragmented than either the United States or China, being a collection of national markets rather than a single market with one currency, the euro. 
 The metrics speak for themselves. The EU’s share of global trade has fallen by one-third to second place (16% of global trade in 2021), compared with China (28.3%) and the United States (14.5%) since 2001. 
 In terms of market revenue of companies in Fortune Global 500, EU companies have fallen to third place between 2005 and 2023, whereas American companies lead with 31.8% and Chinese by 27.5%, while EU companies lag with 15.5%.  
 Europe’s adoption of 5G technology is way behind that of China or the United States.   
 Since R&D is a key driver of innovation and technological leadership, the EU has lagged with 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) spending by 2021, behind China (2.4%) and the United States (3.5%). This is particularly evident in industrial R&D investment amongst the world’s largest 2,500 companies. 
 The EU’s market share has fallen to third place of only 17.5%, overtaken by China (17.8%), whereas the United States leads with 42.1%. Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and engineering products (including industrial machinery) are already taking EU markets by storm. 
 Add to the fact that the EU’s energy costs are higher than that in the United States or China, and that EU regulations are the most complex relative to other markets, it is not surprising that EU companies have been shifting their production overseas.  
 Labour productivity has stagnated for years due to the highest social protection standards. As the report says, the EU’s regulatory environment needs an upgrade to empower and reward innovators, a reduction of EU and national regulatory silo-thinking, and enhancement of technology deployment with stronger public-private collaboration.  
 These European lessons are salutary for real sector transformation for almost all emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).  
 Despite being shocked by the global financial crisis of 2008, Europe has not undertaken structural reforms in the labour and corporate sectors to improve overall competitiveness.
 The financial sector, dominated by the fragmented banking system, remains risk-averse. German, French and Swiss banks are a shadow of their former global prowess, having been hit hard by tighter regulations and inept consolidations.
 The real issue is who drives the structural changes. In America, it is quite clear that the private corporate sector remains dynamic and committed to profits and innovation. In China, the government or party takes the lead, but allowed enough corporate competition that is aligned with national goals. No one pretends that American or Chinese corporations are neoliberal by inclination. 
 The EU and many EMDEs still suffer a schizophrenic tension between the old neoliberal aim of free markets, with newer liking for state intervention and industrial policies. The neoliberal approach failed where governments and the public think that just passing more laws and regulations would solve social and market ills.
 As we all have learnt from bitter experience, policies and programmes are easily frustrated at the legislative or political levels, or mired in forever legal suits by vested interests against change.  
 Eco-system change is complex and requires not only the construction of a common narrative of why you need change, but also concrete execution of visible projects that demonstrate determination and engender public trust. 
 If you want the economy to change, appoint business leaders who understand how to manage institutional change that remains business-friendly.   
 Indonesian president Jokowi’s appointment of former tech platform Gojek president Nadiem Makarim as Minister of Education is an example of how to shake a traditional educational bureaucracy towards technological eco-system change. Radical change needs radical thinking, but by someone like Jensen Huang who understands both the role of technology and markets.   
 The AI revolution is already happening at frightening speed.  Economies that mess up the transition will be marginalised.  Those companies and communities that adapt well will not only survive but thrive.  
 That is the cruelness of Darwinian competition.

693225,StarBiz,11,14/06/2024,"Oracle shares hit record high on AI, cloud growth",Revenue set for double-digit increase by next year,"NEW YORK: Oracle Corp is reporting better-than-expected bookings and announced partnership deals with tech rivals, giving a boost to chairman Larry Ellison’s effort to redefine the software maker as a major competitor in the business of cloud computing. The shares hit a record high.
 The company, known for its database software, is focused on expanding its cloud infrastructure unit – which rents computing power and storage – to compete with Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google. 
 While this division produces a small portion of total sales, investors view it as Oracle’s major future growth bet.
 Oracle shares gained 13% to close at a record US$140.38 Wednesday in New York, the biggest single-day increase since December 2021. The stock has jumped 33% this year.
 In the past two quarters, “Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history – driven by enormous demand for training artificial intelligence (AI) large language models in the Oracle Cloud,” chief executive officer Safra Catz said Tuesday in a statement.
 Revenue growth will increase by double digits in the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, fuelled by strong demand for AI workloads, Catz said.
 Growth should accelerate through the year as the cloud unit’s “capacity begins to catch up with demand”, she added.
 Oracle also announced a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. 
 A similar deal with Microsoft, which was announced in late 2023, “will turbocharge our cloud database growth”, Ellison said in a separate statement. 
 OpenAI, which has received billions in funding from Microsoft, will use Austin-based Oracle’s cloud infrastructure for “additional capacity”, the companies said in a statement. 
 Oracle’s cloud has developed a reputation for success with generative AI startups – the company touted customers including including Reka, MosaicML, and Elon Musk’s xAI. AI technology needs enormous computing power to work. 
 “The world’s largest cloud companies and the world’s most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle Cloud services and data centres,” Ellison said on a conference call after the company released its financial fourth-quarter results.
 The momentum in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business “is undeniable and the OpenAI announcement creates another positive data point in AI”, wrote Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI.
 Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana said the demand to run AI workloads in Oracle’s cloud computing data centres “could catapult it to become the fourth-largest cloud provider”.
 Catz said on the conference call that the cloud infrastructure unit will grow more than 50% in the current financial year.
 Oracle said that total remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted sales, increased 44% to US$98bil in the period ended May 31, far surpassing the average estimate of US$73.9bil.
 Revenue from the cloud unit that rents computing power and storage increased 42% to US$2bil, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected US$1.97bil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Total revenue gained 3.3% to US$14.3bil, compared with the US$14.6bil average estimate. Profit, excluding some items, was US$1.63 per share. Analysts expected US$1.65.
 Underwhelming results from peers like Salesforce Inc and Workday Inc in recent weeks have fuelled investor anxiety that technology budgets are being funnelled away from application software to AI tools. 
 Sales in Oracle’s cloud applications business, including its Fusion apps for corporate finance, increased 10% to US$3.3bil. 
 That’s a slowdown from the roughly 14% growth the unit has seen over recent quarters and below analysts’ estimates.
 The new partnerships are likely to accelerate growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which could help offset a slowdown in applications, Rana wrote in a note after the earnings were released. — Bloomberg",york racle corp reporting booking partnership deal rival chairman larry ellison effort redefine software maker major competitor business cloud share record company database software cloud infrastructure unit power storage compete microsoft corp alphabet google division portion total sale investor major future growth oracle share record wednesday york biggest single day december stock quarter oracle largest sale contract history enormous demand artificial intelligence language model cloud chief executive officer safra catz tuesday statement revenue growth increase double digit current fiscal strong demand workload catz growth cloud unit capacity demand oracle agreement namesake database google cloud infrastructure deal late turbocharge cloud database growth separate statement openai billion microsoft austin oracle cloud infrastructure additional capacity company statement cloud developed reputation success generative startup company customer reka mosaicml elon musk xai technology enormous power largest cloud company successful company oracle cloud service data centre conference call company financial fourth quarter momentum oracle cloud infrastructure business undeniable openai announcement positive data kirk materne analyst isi bloomberg intelligence analyst rana demand workload cloud data centre fourth largest cloud provider catz conference call cloud infrastructure unit current financial oracle total performance obligation measure future sale bil period average estimate bil revenue unit rent power storage bil company statement analyst projected bil data bloomberg total revenue bil average estimate profit item share analyst underwhelming peer workday week investor anxiety technology budget application software tool sale cloud application business fusion corporate finance slowdown growth unit quarter analyst estimate partnership growth oracle cloud infrastructure business slowdown application note earnings bloomberg,"[(0, 0.99646014)]",0
693229,StarBiz,11,14/06/2024,Adobe results  to reveal scale  of threat from  AI competition,,"CHICAGO: Investors in Adobe Inc are increasingly on edge about competition from generative artificial intelligence (AI). 
 The Photoshop maker’s results will illustrate how it’s coping with the threat. 
 Earlier this week, Melius Research downgraded Adobe to “hold” from “buy”, citing risks from image and video generators from OpenAI and Alphabet Inc’s Google. 
 Adobe shares are down more than 20% this year as Wall Street considers its prospects in a world where AI products create text and images out of user prompts. 
 “Companies will pay for software that offers a clear return on investment, but it’s become less clear which services do if AI platforms can just offer a version of the product as a feature,” said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. 
 “Adobe is integrating AI into its own products, but AI images and video are becoming really good, really fast – and it could become a loser to the extent people stop spending on it and use AI instead.”
 On one hand, software companies focused on AI have performed well this year, including Microsoft Corp, Palantir Technologies Inc, and C3.ai Inc. 
 However, there have also been sell-offs from the likes of Salesforce Inc, Workday Inc, MongoDB Inc and UiPath Inc, which warned about weaker enterprise IT spending, a headwind that could also impact Adobe, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
 Adobe’s last report featured a weak outlook, underlining concerns about competition. 
 Consensus estimates for the company’s net full-year earnings are down 13% over the past three months, though the view for revenue has held steady.
 Since its mid-March report, the firm has worked to reassure investors. AI-related product announcements at its annual Summit conference were viewed positively, as was pricing information for its Acrobat AI Assistant services. 
 While that has failed to reverse the stock’s drop, bulls have other positives they can point to. 
 Yesterday’s report is expected to show 20% growth in net earnings, along with nearly 10% revenue growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 Full-year revenue is seen growing at a double-digit pace for the next few fiscal years, while free cash flow is expected to grow 13% this year before accelerating to nearly 25% next year.
 The stock trades at 24 times estimated earnings, a discount to its long-term average, and its recent weakness could mean a low bar to clear in the results. 
 More than 75% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while the average price target points to upside of 31%. — Bloomberg",chicago investor edge competition generative artificial intelligence photoshop maker illustrate threat week melius adobe hold risk image video generator google adobe share street considers prospect product text image prompt company software offer investment service platform version product feature sean sun portfolio manager investment management adobe product image loser extent people hand software company microsoft corp palantir technology offs salesforce workday uipath weaker enterprise spending headwind impact adobe bloomberg intelligence adobe report weak outlook underlining concern competition consensus company net earnings month revenue steady mid march report firm reassure investor product announcement annual summit conference acrobat assistant service reverse stock drop bull yesterday report growth net earnings revenue growth data bloomberg revenue double digit pace fiscal free cash flow grow stock trade earnings discount term average weakness low bar analyst bloomberg recommend stock average price target bloomberg,"[(0, 0.22925407), (2, 0.5861171), (4, 0.18024585)]",2
692901,StarBiz,14,13/06/2024,Morgan Stanley brings AI tools to Australia clients,Wall Street bank unveils more software Down Under,"SYDNEY: Morgan Stanley plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to manage rich people’s portfolios in Australia as the Wall Street bank roll outs more software in the country that’s used in other parts of the world.
 “Other regions are a little bit more established. It’s a real opportunity for us to bring some of the leading ideas we have learned from overseas markets to Australia,” Morgan Stanley’s head of wealth management for Australia, Rebecca Hill, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV yesterday in Sydney. 
 The decision comes as the value of high-net worth individuals in Australia rose about 8% last year and now exceeds US$1 trillion for first time, according to a Capgemini report last week. 
 Morgan Stanley in March appointed its first global head of AI as banks around the world seek to capitalise on potential cost savings. 
 “On the whole Australia is a more maturing market. We are starting to become more sophisticated as investors, but it’s still very early days,” Hill said, speaking on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit.
 As a result of such initiatives and overall growth in assets under management in line with a strong local economy, the firm has plans to add more headcount, Hill said. 
 She didn’t specify how many staff the wealth business might add.
 Morgan Stanley is already the largest global wealth management provider in Australia, with more than A$41bil (US$27bil) in client assets, according to its website. 
 The firm has more than 100 financial advisers in five branches across the country working with high net worth individuals, family offices and not-for-profits.
 Morgan Stanley chief executive officer Ted Pick earlier said AI could help its financial advisers save up to 15 hours a week. 
 The bank’s been beefing up its wealth operations in Asia-Pacific for years, after integrating the business with the firm’s institutional securities group. 
 Globally, the wealth business has been a star performer and cemented its increased importance by posting better-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. 
 The unit is just months into new leadership after Jed Finn was appointed to run the US$4.8 trillion business in November.
 Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s Australia chief Richard Wagner said the country is benefitting from an increase in capital flows that cements its ability to cushion investment risk during a period of global turbulence.
 “It’s very, very hard to lose money in Australia and therefore that safe haven has been an attraction of capital, particularly in the last 12 months as we’ve seen such extended volatility in China,” Wagner said in a Bloomberg TV interview yesterday. 
 “Most of the global money that’s been pointed at Asia-Pacific has been reweighted away from China. And the beneficiaries of that have been Australia, Japan and India.”
 Deal activity in Australia is improving month by month, Wagner said, with the bank expecting a pick up in activity as investors get more clarity on the trajectory of global interest rates and the US presidential election.
 “The rabbit hasn’t jumped out of the hat quite yet, but every month gets better,” he said, speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit in Sydney. 
 That follows a “couple of tough years in investment banking”, he added. 
 Morgan Stanley’s Pick, who took over from Australian-born James Gorman at the start of this year, has pledged to keep meeting the firm’s goals in the wealth business while unlocking additional gains in investment banking. 
 In Australia, Morgan Stanley has nabbed a lead manager role on the initial public offering (IPO) of Mexican food chain Guzman y Gomez, the first large IPO in years, while advising troubled real-estate developer Lendlease Group on its breakup plans.
 Adding to Australia’s relative strength is an economy that Wagner – like Treasurer Jim Chalmers – is betting will not enter a recession, in part due to the windfall from the country’s resources export base and historically low unemployment. — Bloomberg",sydney morgan stanley plan artificial intelligence capability rich people portfolio wall street bank roll out software country region established real opportunity idea overseas market morgan stanley head wealth management hill interview bloomberg yesterday decision net worth individual exceeds time capgemini report week morgan stanley march global head bank capitalise potential cost saving market sophisticated investor day sideline morgan stanley australia result initiative growth asset management strong local economy firm headcount hill staff wealth business morgan largest global wealth management provider australia bil bil client asset website firm financial adviser branch country net worth individual family office profit stanley chief executive officer pick financial adviser hour week bank wealth operation pacific business firm institutional security business star performer revenue quarter unit month leadership jed finn business morgan stanley australia chief richard wagner country increase capital cement ability cushion investment risk period global turbulence hard lose money australia safe attraction capital month volatility china wagner bloomberg interview yesterday global money asia pacific china beneficiary japan india deal activity month month bank pick activity investor trajectory global rate presidential election rabbit month bloomberg sideline stanley australia summit sydney couple tough investment banking morgan stanley pick australian james gorman meeting firm wealth business additional gain investment banking australia lead manager role initial public offering ipo mexican food chain guzman ipo troubled real estate developer lendlease breakup plan australia relative strength economy wagner treasurer jim chalmers enter recession windfall country resource low unemployment bloomberg,"[(2, 0.7453062), (3, 0.2515588)]",2

692577,StarBiz,5,12/06/2024,"Generative AI set to shake up job market, create new opportunities",,"PETALING JAYA: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to replace or make some jobs obsolete, but it could also mean new job opportunities in other areas.
 Speakers in a forum organised by Star Media Group Bhd’s Leaders Council Power Breakfast yesterday said that there were pertinent concerns among the incoming workforce, who are mostly students now, about potential job losses from the wider adoption of generative AI, which is a much more advanced form of AI.The forum was titled “Shaping the Digital Future of Malaysia”.
 Fabian Bigar, chief executive officer of MyDigital Corp, a government agency under the Digital Ministry, said the advent of generative AI is similar to another industrial revolution which is likely to shake up the job market.
 The present sentiment towards AI appears to be more pessimistic with regards to potential job losses but Fabian noted there could be upside opportunities from this development. This was also echoed by other panelists at the forum.
 “AI has been there a long time, but the development of generative AI feels like there is a revolution, as within a short span of time things have been transformed. 
 “There is a change in how we interact with the rest of the world or machines and it can generate new things,” Bigar said. 
 “In the past AI needed to be trained and programmed to do specific tasks. Right now, with generative AI, it can come out with new things by itself. It is self-learning and is able to create new things. That’s why it’s important to fact-check as the system can ‘hallucinate’, but if it is fed with enough accurate information it can actually give a reliable output,” he added.
 Bigar cited previous technological developments, such as when automobiles became more widespread, which meant makers of horse-drawn carriages became obsolete. However, it also led to a new types of jobs such as mechanics and engineers.
 “Generative AI could mean the displacement of menial or repetitive jobs that can be done by the technology. But then to maintain these systems still requires human intervention and judgement. 
 IBM Asean’s general manager and group technology leader Catherine Lian said  that generative AI had already replaced jobs related to expense claims within the  group.
 “IBM has got about 450,000 employees globally. Jobs related to processing claims for things like travel expenses have been repurposed. We have taken away 5,000 such jobs worldwide as there is a 100% replacement here by generative AI at IBM. 
 “The jobs have been lost but the people have been repurposed to other roles such as marketing and human resources. A repetitive task is a 100% replaceable by generative AI,” Lian said.
 Meanwhile, Siemens Malaysia’s president and chief executive officer Tindaro Danze said it is quite likely jobs in computer programming or coding would become obsolete within the next ten years.
 “In 10 years from now, any person can programme a machine and coding is going to be obsolete,” Danze said.
 Generative AI could also change the way education is carried out eventually, said MyDigital’s Bigar.
 “The schooling experience may be a little bit different, I don’t think it will be about knowledge any more, but rather about asking the right questions,” he added.
 Pos Malaysia Bhd’s group chief executive Charles Brewer said he sees generative AI as an exciting development that’s anticipated to change many different parts of its business. “Generative AI is a huge opportunity and super exciting. We know of 642 use cases where it would add significant value to our employees, customers and business. On the flipside, we have to think of the jobs that would no longer exist, and we would need to reskill these people and create new business units,” Brewer told StarBiz.
 Danze said the situation in the job market and the impact of generative AI is still playing out, and is difficult to predict what new jobs or industries would come about.
 “Ten years ago, no one would’ve thought that ride hailing would be such a huge job market. As the application of new technologies increases, the opportunities of new jobs will increase at the same pace,” he said.

691875,Lifestyle,4,10/06/2024,AI in the workplace,"Though AI is transforming business  operations and marketing, it still struggles  with creative tasks and needs human  oversight to avoid errors.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence, or AI, is changing the way businesses operate, and its use is expected to only become more prevalent in the future.
 Ken Opremke, regional manager of Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania, said he’s seeing more and more business models that include the use of AI.
 Ben Franklin makes seed investments in early-stage technology companies, funds innovation in established manufacturers, and supports clients with in-house experts and a network of technical and business resources.
 “It’s not just about a cool technology, it’s about a useful tool that facilitates marketing and business efficiency,” Opremke said.
 Bethany Staples, executive creative director and CEO at Market Share Consulting in Olyphant, said that although she dabbled in using AI on a personal level when ChatGPT was released, she didn’t feel comfortable using it in her marketing and consulting business until late last year.
 “That was when I started recognising (the value in) the use of AI for repetitive tasks and things that I otherwise was spending a tonne of time doing that could just be easily done in half of the time by automating those things,” Staples said.
 But she doesn’t like AI for creative aspects of her work.
 “Traditionally, I think in the marketing world, people expect you to be using it for things like content creation or photoshopping certain things and all of that. Personally, I’m not there yet,” Staples said.
 She said AI-generated material seems obviously created by a robot.
 “So we’re very conscientious of that, especially in the marketing world when it comes to social media content creation or script writing for original content and things like that,” Staples said. “It feels very ob­­vious that a robot is talking to you and not a human, and I feel like it’s losing a human touch.”
 Cheating and hallucinations
 Recent AI technology is probably best known for its ability to do anything from write a term paper or newspaper article to create original images based on other images, depending on what a user asks.
 Using it to cheat at school is one concern voiced by many.
 Kim Pavlick, an associate professor in the communications and media department at the University of Scranton, has been delving into AI topics with her students for about three semesters.
 “The way I approach it is that I explain to students that it’s like a calculator. We use a calculator for math now, but our parents’ generation freaked out at that – how can you dare use a calculator for math? 
 “And now, people are freaking out about AI. It’s a tool. If you don’t know how to use the tool well, and you don’t know how to use the tool correctly, it’s not going to help you,” Pavlick said.
 She also cautions students about “hallucinations”, the phenomenon in which an AI large language model (LLM) creates false information by perceiving patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to human observers.
 Pavlick said AI can’t replace humans, who use critical thinking in their jobs. 
 “AI might not take your job, but someone who knows how to leverage AI may take your job,” she said.
 A spectrum of uses
 AI is also being used for many other things in business other than just content creation. It can be found in everything from auto repair and sales to manufacturing to medicine.
 “Our AI focus is on translating data science into clinical and operational practice,” David Vawdrey, chief data informatics officer at Geisinger, said via email.Vawdrey said Geisinger is exploring generative AI capabilities, but because of the risks and limitations associated with current AI tools, such as misinformation, bias and privacy concerns, it’s essential to have human experts in the loop.
 Like other healthcare systems, Geisinger will soon begin evaluating “ambient clinical documentation”, where, with the patient’s permission, generative AI is used to compose a draft of the doctor’s notes during a clinic encounter.
 “Doctors still have to review and edit the draft, but if the computer system can help reduce the paperwork burden, it will enable more time and attention for patients,” Vawdrey said.
 Blue-collar bots?
 David Centak, general mana­­ger of Subaru of Wyoming Valley in Plains Twp, Pennsylvania, said auto dealers can use AI chatbots to answer customers’ basic questions about autos for sale on a company’s website and create sales leads.
 It can also be used in diagnostics for engines and other auto systems, although Subaru of Wyoming Valley doesn’t yet use AI for those purposes.
 “But I’m almost certain it will be incorporated at some point in the future,” Centak said.
 Kevin Jones, co-owner and CEO of transmedia company VizVibe, located in the Luzerne Bank Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, said he’s using AI to assist with the company’s core focus: augmented reality for industrial solutions.
 VizVibe creates computer programs that, for example, would allow a supervisor to hand a tablet or smartphone to an assembly line worker who could view a piece of machinery on the screen using the camera, tap the screen displaying a part of the machinery, and then see text or video instructions overlayed on the screen on how to properly use or manipulate the component.
 “We’re working with AI for image recognition of those parts, for quicker recognition for the overlays of the content that give instructions for troubleshooting, service, maintenance, and that sort of thing with the machines and the assembly lines in manufacturing,” Jones said.
 “It keeps the production lines running quicker, it reduces downtime, it improves product flow, and that sort of thing,” he added. “And then, on the flip side, the employees on the line could use AI to report trouble spots, and AI learns where the trouble spots are, what it is that’s breaking down, and it’ll allow preventative maintenance to happen faster”.
 Jones said AI can also improve logistics production times because employers can use AI to generate reports right on the assembly line.
 “It can say, hey, this is where there’s a juggernaut, or this is where things get held up. And then we can use the information, the data from the AI, along with the AR overlays, again, to increase productivity,” Jones said.
 Historical companion
 AI and AR are also being used in the travel and tourism industry, Jones said.
 VizVibe has created a smartphone app for people taking the Walkitecture historic tour of Wilkes-Barre. This self-guided tour features 24 different stops, allowing users to capture images of historic buildings using the app. The app utilises AI to provide information about each building.
 The app can be further developed using AI to recognise questions about a building or person spoken into the smartphone and then display prerecorded videos of a period actor or historian addressing the question directly.Like Pavlick, Jones views AI as a tool.
 “In the long run, on the industry side of things, it’s probably going to replace people’s jobs because it’s going to make manufacturing and production and those things a lot more streamlined,” Jones said. 
 “But the jobs that are going to remain are going to be higher­­-paying jobs and more-refined jobs. So, I guess, in that aspect, it’s a double-edged sword.” – The Citizens’ Voice/Tribune News Service",artificial intelligence business prevalent future opremke regional manager ben franklin technology partner northeastern pennsylvania business model ben franklin seed investment stage technology company fund manufacturer client house expert network technical business resource technology tool business efficiency bethany staple creative director ceo market share olyphant personal level chatgpt feel comfortable marketing consulting business repetitive task tonne time half time staple creative aspect people content creation staple material robot conscientious marketing social medium content creation script original content staple feel vious robot human feel human touch cheating hallucination technology ability write term paper newspaper article original image image user cheat school concern kim pavlick associate professor communication medium department university scranton topic student semester explain student calculator math parent generation dare calculator math people tool tool tool pavlick caution student hallucination language model llm false pattern object nonexistent imperceptible human observer human critical thinking job job leverage job spectrum business content creation auto repair sale medicine focus data science clinical operational practice david vawdrey chief data informatics officer geisinger vawdrey geisinger generative capability limitation current tool misinformation privacy concern essential human expert healthcare system geisinger ambient clinical documentation patient permission generative compose draft doctor clinic encounter doctor edit draft computer system paperwork burden enable time attention patient vawdrey blue collar bot centak mana ger subaru valley plain pennsylvania auto dealer chatbots customer basic question auto sale company website create sale diagnostics engine auto system valley purpose future centak kevin jones owner transmedia company vizvibe luzerne bank downtown wilkes pennsylvania assist company core focus reality industrial solution computer program hand tablet smartphone worker view machinery screen camera tap screen machinery text video instruction screen manipulate component image recognition quicker recognition content instruction service maintenance sort machine line jones production line quicker reduces improves product flow sort flip employee report trouble spot trouble spot preventative maintenance faster jones logistics production time employer generate report juggernaut data productivity jones historical companion travel tourism industry jones smartphone app people historic tour wilkes tour feature user capture historic building app utilises building app recognise question person smartphone display video period actor historian question pavlick jones view tool industry people job production lot jones job job job sword voice tribune news service,"[(2, 0.9974956)]",2
691949,StarBiz,6,10/06/2024,Content Forum backs AI governance suggestion,"Curbing misuse in content creation, distribution crucial","PETALING JAYA: The Communications and Multimedia Content Forum of Malaysia (Content Forum) fully backs the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s (MCMC) suggestions for the regulatory measures needed to govern the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in content creation and distribution.
 This came after MCMC member Derek John Fernandez’s recent recommendations regarding the urgent need for regulatory measures to govern the use of AI in content creation and distribution.
 Fernandez highlighted the critical importance of curbing the misuse of AI technologies, such as deepfakes, which can significantly threaten public peace and national security. 
 He emphasised the necessity for a regulatory framework that mandates clear disclosure when images or videos are generated by AI, thereby preventing the spread of misinformation and protecting individuals from becoming victims of online fraud.
 Content Forum CEO Mediha Mahmood said the regulatory body aligns with these recommendations, recognising that they are in perfect harmony with its mission to advocate the self-regulation of content within Malaysia’s digital space, as outlined in the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code 2022 (Code). 
 This Code highlights the importance of transparency, already requiring disclosures when influencers are used for marketing purposes. 
 Extending these principles to include AI-generated content will further strengthen consumer trust and protect the community from misleading information.
 Content Forum is an independent self-regulatory body registered under the MCMC as an industry forum designated by the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 to oversee and promote self-regulation of content over the electronic networked medium.
 Meanwhile, Content Forum chairman Rafiq Razali emphasised the collective responsibility in ensuring the safe use of AI in content creation, stating: “AI has immense potential to revolutionise the content industry, driving unprecedented levels of creativity and efficiency.
 “Yet, this potential must be managed with careful consideration. It is imperative that the lawmakers, AI service providers, regulators and content creators work collaboratively to allocate sufficient resources and ensure these technologies are used responsibly. 
 “Prioritising user safety and maintaining the integrity of digital content are crucial to fostering a trustworthy content environment,” he said.
 Mediha said recent incidents where deepfake videos featuring well-known public figures went viral had caused widespread confusion within the community. 
 Furthermore, there are cases where AI-generated content has been used to scam the unsuspecting public with highly believable content. These incidents are a stark reminder of how easily AI can be misused to manipulate information and deceive the public, she noted.
 By implementing regulations like mandating the disclosure of AI-generated content, she said it is possible to mitigate these risks and safeguard the community from digital deception.
 Mediha added: “When the Internet was first introduced, we could not anticipate the full range of challenges that would arise, from cyberbullying to misinformation. 
 “These issues continue to evolve and Malaysia remains committed to addressing them through effective legislation and regulation.
 “As we stand on the brink of widespread AI adoption, we must learn from past experiences.”
 Mediha emphasised that pre-empting potential harms through swift and effective regulation is not just prudent, but is also essential.
 “The Content Forum is confident that by taking proactive measures, we can fully harness the transformative benefits of AI, while maintaining a safe and secure digital landscape. 
 “It encourages all stakeholders within the digital content ecosystem to work together in developing robust regulatory frameworks that protect user interests and promote innovation,” Mediha noted.
 As an industry self-regulatory body, the Content Forum comprises key members of the communications and multimedia content industry, including broadcasters, advertisers, content creators, Internet access service providers and civic groups. 
 This dynamic and robust representation of industry practitioners ensures that content standards continue to be developed with the objective of establishing a level playing field in the industry.
 It is also responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code (Content Code). The Content Code was prepared by the Content Forum and first registered with MCMC on Sept 1, 2004, with a revamp in 2022. 
 The Content Code is the principal source for industry self-regulation as it contains governing standards and best practices for content dissemination within the communications and multimedia industry in Malaysia. 
 The main objective of the Content Code is to outline procedures of self-regulation that provides the platform for creativity, innovation and healthy growth of a fast-evolving industry.",jaya communication content forum malaysia content forum malaysian communication commission mcmc suggestion regulatory measure artificial intelligence content creation distribution mcmc derek john fernandez recommendation urgent regulatory measure content creation distribution fernandez critical curbing misuse technology threaten public peace national security necessity regulatory framework mandate disclosure spread misinformation individual victim fraud content forum ceo mediha mahmood regulatory body aligns recommendation perfect harmony mission advocate regulation content malaysia digital space malaysian communication content code code code highlight transparency disclosure influencers purpose principle content strengthen consumer trust community misleading content forum independent regulatory body mcmc industry forum communication oversee promote regulation content electronic networked medium content forum chairman rafiq razali collective responsibility safe content creation immense potential revolutionise content industry unprecedented level creativity efficiency potential careful consideration imperative lawmaker service provider regulator content creator sufficient resource technology user safety integrity digital content crucial fostering trustworthy content environment mediha incident video public figure viral widespread confusion community content scam public believable content incident stark manipulate deceive public implementing regulation disclosure content mitigate risk community digital deception mediha internet anticipate range challenge misinformation issue malaysia committed effective legislation regulation brink widespread adoption learn experience pre potential harm effective regulation prudent essential content forum confident proactive measure transformative benefit safe secure digital landscape stakeholder digital content ecosystem robust regulatory framework user promote innovation mediha industry regulatory body content forum comprises key communication content industry broadcaster advertiser content creator internet access service provider dynamic robust representation industry practitioner content standard objective level field industry responsible implementation enforcement malaysian communication content code content code content code content forum mcmc sept revamp content code principal source industry regulation standard practice content dissemination communication industry malaysia main objective content code outline procedure platform creativity innovation healthy growth industry,"[(2, 0.996988)]",2

 Rabo, a company that develops technology for pet owners, offers a smart collar for owners to track what their cats are up to. 
 The Catlog collar tracks inputs such as a cat’s routine, appetite, behaviour and provides a health analysis using AI. This allows owners to be alerted of potential issues.
 A sleep tracking feature will also be rolled out in June, where AI will be used to compare a cat’s data against medical histories of 30,000 other felines.
 CEO Yukiko Iyo told Nikkei Asia that Rabo aims to help cats stay with their owners for as long as possible, even as Japan’s cats – much like its human population – continue to grow older.
 A guideline published by Japan’s Environment Ministry showed that the country’s cats are living longer, with the average lifespan reaching a record 15.79 years in 2023 – roughly equivalent to the human age of 79.
 However, since cats normally hide their discomfort and mask any health issues, nipping health problems in the bud can be challenging.
 Tech firm Carelogy has deve­loped an app that can tell owners when their cats are in pain. 
 This is done by teaching AI how to identify five signs of discomfort in cats, such as ears that are pulled apart or muscles that are tensed.
 A survey by the Japan Pet Food Association in 2023 showed that about 60% of cat owners had taken their pets to the vet in the past year just once, or not at all.
 There were about 9.06 million pet cats in Japan in 2023, with a representative from the Japan Pet Food Association noting that demand for pets grew during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 More opted for cats, which are seen to take less work, than dogs. — The Straits Times /ANN",artificial intelligence health sector cat paw sitive effect startup country cat health tapping nikkei asia rabo company technology pet owner smart collar owner cat collar track input routine health analysis owner potential issue feature june cat data medical history feline yukiko iyo nikkei asia rabo cat owner cat human population guideline japan environment ministry country average lifespan reaching record equivalent human age cat mask health issue health bud tech firm carelogy deve app owner identify sign discomfort cat pulled muscle survey japan pet food association cat owner vet pet cat representative japan pet food association demand pet covid pandemic cat strait time,"[(5, 0.9892427)]",5

691003,StarBiz,10,07/06/2024,Telecoms player TeleAI surmounts dialect challenge,,"BEIJING: In a groundbreaking development, TeleAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) research division of China Telecom, has unveiled the industry’s first advanced speech recognition model capable of understanding and processing over 30 Chinese dialects.
 This large language model (LLM), known as Xingchen in Chinese, addresses a significant barrier in customer service, where millions of daily calls, especially from elderly users in remote regions, are made in local dialects that traditional AI systems and customer service representatives struggle to understand.
 With approximately 20% of China’s population not fluent in spoken Mandarin Chinese, this advancement aims to bridge the communication gap, ensuring equitable access to digital services for all, China Telecom said.
 TeleAI has tackled the challenge of creating an LLM that breaks away from conventional approaches, which typically limit recognition to a single dialect.
 By incorporating Cantonese, Shanghainese, Sichuanese and Wenzhounese, among others, the Xingchen model marks a significant leap forward in natural language processing technology, China Telecom said.
 This is particularly crucial for elderly residents and those in less-developed regions, who rely heavily on their native dialects for communication, the company added.
 Traditionally, dialect research has been a labour-intensive process, reliant on subjective human assessment and annotation, making comprehensive documentation difficult.
 AI, with its ability to systematically and efficiently catalogue and analyse linguistic data, offers a transformative solution. 
 TeleAI said it has already amassed a database exceeding 30,000 hours of high-quality dialect speech, positioning itself as a leader in this field.
 The Xingchen speech recognition model is currently being piloted across several regions.
 In these provinces, regions and cities, China Telecom’s intelligent customer service has integrated this model, enhancing its ability to comprehend and respond to calls in 30 dialects. — China Daily/ANN",development teleai artificial intelligence division china telecom industry speech recognition model capable understanding chinese dialect language model llm xingchen chinese address customer service million elderly user region local dialect traditional system customer service representative understand china population fluent mandarin chinese advancement aim communication gap equitable access digital service telecom teleai challenge llm break conventional approach recognition single dialect cantonese shanghainese sichuanese wenzhounese model mark natural language processing technology china crucial elderly resident region native dialect communication company dialect labour intensive process reliant subjective human assessment annotation comprehensive documentation difficult ability catalogue analyse linguistic data offer transformative solution teleai database exceeding hour quality speech leader field xingchen speech recognition model region province region city telecom intelligent customer service model ability respond dialect china daily ann,"[(2, 0.99276733)]",2
690879,StarBiz,11,05/06/2024,Nvidia and AMD square off in fight to take control of AI adoption,,"NEW YORK: Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (AMD) chiefs showcased new generations of the chips powering the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI) development, deepening a rivalry that’s shaping the future of AI design and adoption.
 Jensen Huang and Lisa Su, both born in Taiwan and now local celebrities for leading US tech powerhouses, employed different tacks in conveying their expertise during back-to-back shows at the world’s largest computing conference this week in Taipei. 
 Nvidia’s chief executive officer (CEO) repeatedly voiced his US$2.8 trillion company’s dominance in the accelerators that OpenAI and Microsoft Corp rely on to build generative AI services like ChatGPT. 
 Huang went as far as to tease a chip envisioned for 2026 he dubbed Rubin – after Vera Rubin, the American woman who helped discover dark matter. 
 The chip, which will succeed the Blackwell family, will be key to sustaining its runaway leadership. 
 While Huang headlined much of his own two-hour presentation on Sunday, AMD’s Su chose to make hers more of a team effort. 
 She brought out a stream of big-name partners from HP Inc CEO Enrique Lores to Lenovo Group Ltd’s Luca Rossi to convey the company’s focus on designing neural processors – a type of chip that runs AI services directly from laptops. 
 During her Computex address, Asustek Computer Inc chairman Jonney Shih called her “the pride of Taiwan” – a characterisation often associated with Huang of Nvidia, whose market valuation is now about 10 times that of AMD’s.
 “People see Nvidia as a personification of Jensen. And while Lisa is the saviour of AMD, she’s very clear that it’s about everyone around her,” said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at the consultancy More Than Moore. “AMD still have that underdog element about the business, and with AI it’s very much true.”
 The back-to-back presentations, attended by hundreds and watched by thousands more across the globe, underscored the growing stakes in a technology that has the potential to redefine a slew of industries and create new devices that can near-instantly generate video and other content from simple commands. 
 There’s a personal component to the competition too. 
 Su and Huang are not only both Taiwanese, they were born in the same city of roughly 1.8 million on Taiwan’s southern coast and are distant relatives. 
 That hasn’t made either one more willing to cede ground to the other.
 Su was originally tapped by organisers to kick off the week-long conference, one of the most important summits for tech executives around the world. 
 Instead, the Nvidia CEO organised his own presentation the Sunday night before the gathering’s official opening to talk about the chip maker’s strategic plans. 
 Huang, who had keynote Computex a year earlier, spoke at National Taiwan University just hours before the conference opened, essentially stealing the spotlight from his closest competitor. 
 AMD’s Su on Monday referred obliquely to the episode during an OpenAI demo of a chatbot.
 “Let’s start by letting the tool know that we’re interested in Taiwan, and that we’re going to be attending Computex,” Su said. 
 “And you might ask something about the opening keynote,” she quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.
 Nvidia sees the rise of generative AI as a new industrial revolution and expects to play a major role as the technology shifts to personal computers, the CEO said in his keynote address at National Taiwan University. 
 He returned to themes he set out a year ago at the same venue, including the idea that those without AI capabilities will be left behind.
 Delegates to Computex remarked that Huang’s performance drove home Nvidia’s continued dominance – a position that appeared difficult for AMD or any other rival to shake in the short run. 
 One fund manager told Bloomberg News that Huang generated a lot of buzz in particular around Rubin, even though the CEO didn’t go into detail about a chip slated for 2026.
 Shares of Nvidia rose 4.9% in New York on Monday, leaving them up 132% this year. AMD declined 2%.  
 Nvidia is selling customers a fully proprietary system, where businesses can buy its chips, networking gear and everything else required to run advanced AI development in data centres he’s called “AI factories”. 
 AMD, on the other hand, touts open standards that make its hardware interoperable with that of rivals like Intel Corp.

689453,StarBiz,11,04/06/2024,"AMD announces future AI chips, will speed rollout of new models",,"TAIPEI: Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) is speeding up introductions of new artificial intelligence (AI) processors as it seeks to dent Nvidia Corp’s domination of that lucrative market.
 The MI325X will go on sale in the fourth quarter, chief executive officer Lisa Su said in the opening keynote address of the Computex conference in Taiwan. 
 That chip, the successor to the MI300, will feature more memory and faster data throughput, the company said. MI350 will follow in 2025 and the MI400 model a year after that. 
 The move to a roughly annual release cycle matches Nvidia’s plans, set out by chief executive Jensen Huang in a speech the night before in Taipei.
 AMD is among the companies rushing to market with new products aimed at tapping the flood of cash being poured into new AI training systems, money that’s currently mainly being spent on Nvidia’s offerings. 
 Su said the company is still getting strong demand for its existing MI300 products and its new models will compare favourably with rival offerings.
 Santa Clara-based AMD has shown the most progress among the group chasing Nvidia. AMD has increased its sales target for so-called AI accelerators to US$4bil this year. That rapid increase from next to nothing last year still pales in comparison with Nvidia. 
 Nvidia’s data centre unit alone is on course to have annual sales that will exceed US$100bil, according to estimates, topping AMD and Intel Corp’s combined total annual revenue.
 For consumers, AMD talked about its third-generation Ryzen AI processors, dubbed Strix Point and going on sale from July. 
 Those are tailored for laptops and combine RDNA 3.5 mobile graphics, XDNA 2 neural processing units for accelerating AI tasks, and the latest Zen 5 processing cores. 
 Su invited a succession of partners out on stage – from HP Inc chief executive Enrique Lores and Lenovo Group Ltd executive vice-president Luca Rossi to Asustek Computer Inc chairman Jonney Shih – to discuss upcoming machines featuring AMD’s new Ryzen platform.
 AMD showed a slide suggesting the latest Ryzen system performs better with AI tasks than Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon X Elite, the chip that will feature heavily at Computex at the heart of Microsoft Corp’s new Copilot+ PCs. 
 Microsoft’s Windows chief Pavan Davuluri also joined Su on stage to say his team “have collaborated with AMD since day one” on the Copilot PC+ project.
 “On-device AI really for us means faster response times, better privacy and cost,” Davuluri said. “But that means running models that have billions of parameters in them on PC hardware.

689445,StarBiz,16,04/06/2024,Dell expects demand for its AI servers to continue,Company raises revenue outlook to US$98bil for FY25,"NEW YORK: Dell Technologies Inc fell the most since it returned to the public market in 2018 after its first revenue increase since 2022 wasn’t enough to impress investors with high expectations for the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) server business. 
 Sales increased 6.3% to US$22.2bil in the period ended May 3, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said in a statement. 
 Analysts, on average, estimated US$21.6bil. Profit, excluding some items, was US$1.27 a share, compared with the average projection of US$1.23.
 Revenue from Dell’s powerful servers equipped to handle AI tasks more than doubled from the previous quarter to US$1.7bil, chief operating officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement. 
 The backlog for those machines increased more than 30% quarter-on-quarter to US$3.8bil, he added.
 But excitement around AI demand for Dell’s machines created high expectations for last Thursday’s results. 
 The shares dropped 18% to US$139.56 at the close of last Friday in New York, the biggest single-day decline since Dell again became a public company in December 2018. 
 Dell’s stock had more than tripled over the past 12 months as investors have viewed the hardware maker as a beneficiary of demand for AI. 
 Large corporations increasingly need high-powered servers to train and run demanding generative AI tasks, which are sold by Dell and a few other companies.
 “Relative to very high expectations, Dell’s 2025 first quarter results were disappointing,” Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, wrote. 
 He pointed out that a decrease in adjusted operating margin in the quarter resurfaced “concerns that AI servers are being sold at near-zero margins”. 
 Dell expects the momentum from AI demand will continue through the year, chief financial officer Yvonne McGill said on a conference call after the results were released.
 The company raised its revenue outlook for the financial year ending in February 2025 to a range of US$93.5bil to US$97.5bil, an 8% increase at the mid-point, which would top analysts’ average estimates of a 7% gain. 
 Adjusted profit will be about US$7.65 a share, compared with the US$7.70 average estimate.
 Still, that outlook implies relatively flat AI server sales through the rest of the year, which “will cast some doubt on near-term competitiveness”, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho. 
 For its better-known business of selling personal computers (PCs), Dell reported US$12bil in revenue, little changed from the same period a year earlier. 
 Sales of business PCs increased 3% to US$10.2bil, surprising analysts who expected a 2% drop.
 The PC market had seen a historic decline over the last two years after many consumers, businesses and schools purchased laptops in the early months of the pandemic. 
 In the first quarter, shipments picked up 1.5% – the first increase since the end of 2021 – industry analyst IDC said in April. 
 PC-makers have been hopeful that those numbers signalled the end of the slump and that growth would accelerate in 2024 with the launch of machines equipped with a new version of Microsoft Corp’s Windows software as well as hardware equipped with chips to handle new artificial intelligence tools.
 Dell’s primary PC competitor, HP Inc, reported signs of a recovering computer market last Wednesday, sending its shares up 17% the next day. 
 Like Dell, HP reported a bump in sales among its business customers rather than consumers.

689699,Lifestyle,12,04/06/2024,The AI encounter,"While on a scenic tour of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, this writer ‘exchanged’ some words with an AI.","MY first encounter with Artificial Intelligence was both hilarious and hugely embarrassing. It happened in China recently, while on a tour of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
 My wife and I checked into a hotel in a little-known city called Hezhou on the scenic journey to Guilin covering five cities: Hezhou, Liuzhou, Loong Shan, Guilin and Yangshuo, each famous for its unique and dramatic landscapes.
 After collecting my room key, I was told that all electrical gadgets and components in the room were AI-operated. “Just call Xiao Tu to do it and it will respond,” the front desk girl told me cheerfully.
 Trundling our luggage to our room with great anticipation, I intended to ask AI’s help to first turn on the air-conditioner, and then to open the window curtains to get the view outside.
 After inserting the room card in its slot, I went to the air-conditioner controller on the wall and, in my best Malaysian Mandarin, commanded, “Xiao Tu, turn on the air-conditioner.” No response.
 I repeated the instructions several times without getting any result. I thought perhaps I needed to establish some sort of rapport with Xiao Tu first, or even with some pleading for help. But then, it was just a robot, not human, so I perished the thought. 
 I tried again. “Xiao Tu, draw open the curtains.” Nothing happened.
 In desperation, I went to the four corners of the room calling out to Xiao Tu with the same commands.
 Only once, by sheer chance, she responded. She told me to re-phrase my sentence as she could not understand my “brand” of Mandarin. It was hugely embarrassing to say the least. By that time, my wife was already rolling on the bed splitting her sides laughing at the comedy before her.
 I finally admitted defeat and called the front desk for help. When the handyman came, I realised that I had been calling out the wrong name. The AI’s name was “Xiao Du”. I called out again and it worked! A very sweet voice responded, “Wo zai” meaning, “I am here.”
 I also learned that the AI device was a black circular thing sitting next to the TV set.
 My friends who were more tech-savvy were having a whale of a time interacting with the sweet voice in that black box (yes, I know I sound like sour grapes), so much so that they actually missed Xiao Du when they returned to Kuala Lumpur.
 Later, I realised that in Mandarin, Xiao Tu means little rabbit while Xiao Du means little navigator. Obviously, I did not need a rabbit then.
 But back to our travels. Guangxi, to the west of Guang-dong Province, is famous for its rivers and mountains – a journey to Guilin and nearby Yangshuo is like walking into a Chinese landscape painting.
 The most memorable part of our tour was the two days we spent in a homestay in Ping’an, a Zhuang mountain village in Loong Sheng County famous for its rice terraces on Loongji Shan, which means “spine of the dragon”.
 It was a pity that we went in late spring. In winter, we would be able to see snow covering the rice terraces while in autumn, the padi fields would look like a blanket of gold.
 Nevertheless, what we missed out on was compensated by our very hospitable and friendly lady host who guided us around and whose husband cooked for us during our stay. 
 They are from the Zhuang tribe, a minority in Guangxi. They shared with us stories of their lifestyle, livelihood and living environment. They seemed to be a happy lot, very positive and very helpful.
 They reared their own chicken, bought fish from a neighbour who owned a pond, harvested vegetables from their own yards and grew “luo han guo”, a fruit well known to many Malaysians. It is a self-sufficient community indeed.
 The rice terraces were carved into the hill slopes during the Yuan Dynasty and completed in the Qing Dynasty about 700 to 800 years ago by the Zhuang people, who were driven uphill by the fearsome Miao tribe.
 The place has become a huge tourist attraction in the region. Our lady host took some of our younger friends up the hill to savour the panoramic view of the landscape. My wife and I, who were lacking the leg power, were contented just soaking up the view at mid-hill level.
 When the sun set and skies turned a midnight blue, the terraces became somewhat magical when small lights were turned on all over the hills. It was amazing!
 Of course, any tourist to Guangxi would not want to skip Guilin which is more famous than the capital city of Nanning because of its unique and picturesque landscapes. 
 Guilin is surrounded by mountains and rivers but the draw is the two lakes on which the twin Sun and Moon pagodas stand. Also known as the Gold and Silver pagodas, they cast a dreamy spell with their reflections teasing the rippling water.
 We saw huge crowds gathered on the lake side jostling for the best spot to shoot pictures and make videos, and it was not even peak tourist season yet.
 We covered five cities during our tour. In those cities we noticed that besides cars, the streets were jam-packed with e-bikes. There were hardly any bicycles seen, unlike about a decade ago when they were still the top mode of transportation. 
 The city skylines were dominated by high-rise apartments and office buildings, while the morning and night markets were crowded and vibrant.
 The streets are clean and orderly, too, lined with all sorts of eateries offering local cuisine and shops well stocked with daily necessities.
 Inter-city expressways are dotted with modern highway stops with stalls selling pancakes, tea-leaf eggs and snacks such as stewed duck necks, duck tongues and feet, which are local favourites. 
 Toilets are very clean and I dare say it is a gigantic improvement over the days when umbrellas were a handy tool.
 To me, these are concrete evidence of China’s success story of poverty-eradication, bringing progress and modernisation to what used to be a poor and backward region.

688799,Main,17,02/06/2024,Maxims for      the AI Age,LinkedIn  co-founder offers six principles to guide our thinking about the technology’s potential risks and rewards.,"DEBATES about technology have increasingly been reduced to stark dichotomies. Artificial intelligence should be curtailed, or it should be accelerated: thesis and antithesis, but no synthesis. Rather than picking a side, we should consider alternative rallying cries that place the focus where it belongs: humanity. 
 To that end, I propose six maxims. The first is a famous quip from the Carthaginian general Hannibal: “I shall either find a way or make one.” With AI still at a very early stage, we have barely scratched the surface of its potential. AI can help us find paths that we couldn’t see before, and it can help us make new ones through the force of human creativity. Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Pi are trained on material by and about people. Far from replacing us, they extend us. 
 Imagine finding a previously indiscernible thread of insight that runs through Gödel, Escher, Bach, Caravaggio, Rousseau, and Vivaldi; or a thread tying together the ingredients you just happen to have in your kitchen. A vast collection of human creation and past contributions hangs before us like an expanding tapestry, and we now have the tools to do more with it than any previous generation ever could.
 The second maxim is: “We are symbols, and inhabit symbols.” That is how Ralph Waldo Emerson described our use of language to comprehend, explain, and shape the world. We humans have always relied on tools, and that is what symbols are. They enable us to create things that did not exist before and do not occur naturally. Consider the griffin, with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. It is a human creation that reflects some reality we want to see in the world. Humans created griffins for uniquely human reasons. AI is no different.
 True, many imaginative creations – from Mary Shelley’s monster in Frankenstein to James Cameron’s killer cyborg in Terminator – are meant to be cautionary. We naturally feel fear when initially encountering “the other” or “the new.” But the griffin reminds us that we can convert fear into a sense of majestic possibility. Ultimately, humans are both the creators and the products of their symbols, culture, environment, and decisions. Together with AI, we can create more griffins. 
 The third maxim is to build cathedrals, as these ennoble our efforts and turn mere groupings of humanity into fellowships. Actual cathedrals are some of humankind’s most awe-inspiring creations, making it only fitting that we now refer to missions like the Apollo moon landing as “cathedral projects.” How great would it be if these were as much a part of our everyday lives as cathedrals are in European cities?
 Such projects require many sets of hands, working in concert across regions, disciplines, and sometimes even generations. As the writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, “A cathedral is built with stones; it is made up of stones; but the cathedral ennobles each stone, which becomes a cathedral stone.” Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human progress.
 The stories of the telescope, the radio, the car, the elevator, the airplane, and – now – AI follow a similar pattern. While many know AI through recent commercial applications like ChatGPT, it took generations of innovators and inventions to get us to this point. We need grand projects – born of both cooperation but also some healthy competition – to give us a sense of direction. How we design and build our cathedrals tells us who we are, and who we want to be.
 The fourth maxim is that we must take small risks to have any hope of navigating the big ones. Rather than trying to eliminate risk altogether – which is impossible – we ought to welcome challenges that could bring failure, because these create opportunities for iteration, reflection, discussion, and continual improvement.
 Recall the economist Hyman Minsky’s great insight about financial crashes. He saw that “stability” can create its own form of instability. Too many safeguards in a financial system can make it more brittle, and the appearance of safety means that nobody will be prepared when it breaks.
 The same lesson applies to AI regulation. Not only should we incentivise innovation; we should recognise that experimentation – taking smaller risks – is itself a risk-mitigation mechanism. Ultimately, we will get better regulation when these technologies have been deployed widely, allowing more people to try them out and integrate them into their lives. This, too, will be a shared undertaking, involving government, the private sector, the press, academia, the public – all of us.
 The fifth maxim is that technology is what makes us human. If we buy into the notion that AI is the antithesis to humankind’s thesis, we will anticipate a future of half-human, half-machine cyborgs. But that is not really how it works. The combination of thesis and antithesis leads not to a crude mashup, but to a new thesis. The two evolve together, and the resulting synthesis, in this case, is a better human.
 Moreover, AI may help us become more humane. Consider how responsive, present, and patient conversational AI models and chatbots can be. These features could have a profound impact on us. Not everyone has reliable access to human kindness and support. But when such resources become readily available, that will improve many people’s own capacities for kindness and empathy. And empathy can beget empathy. I think this dimension of AI’s potential has yet to be fully appreciated.
 The sixth and final maxim is that we have an obligation to make the future better than the present. Imagine a personalised digital doctor or tutor in everyone’s pocket. What are the costs of that happening later, rather than sooner? Speed is a virtue when it comes to technology, given its unrivalled power to improve lives.
 Everyone should ask themselves what a promising synthesis might look like. What if we can usher in a new era of human flourishing, where AI-driven research helps us discover new cures and harness the power of nuclear fusion in time to avert the worst consequences of climate change?

 Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the passing of the bill was important to the industry, as it protects and enhances the nation’s cyber security through compliance with specific measures, standards and processes in managing cyber security threats.
 “However, I do admit that we are just building the infrastructure on artificial intelligence (AI), so I think we need time to compete with Singapore. 
 “But it has resulted positively, for example in the case of Microsoft, because that was one of the concerns raised before they (Microsoft) made their investment announcement (US$2.2bil investment in Malaysia’s cloud and AI transformation),” he said at a media briefing here on the National Semiconductor Strategy yesterday.

686215,StarBiz,11,28/05/2024,Startups to play major role in AI landscape,Govt sets goal for country to be a leader in field,"HANOI: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the startup scene around the world, including Vietnam. 
 AI took centre stage for the first time in history during the recent World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland in January, becoming one of the hot topics alongside issues like security, employment and climate change. 
 Within the vast realm of AI, generative AI (GenAI) stole the spotlight, showcasing the ability to simulate human intelligence and generate new content. 
 The technology is set to revolutionise human behaviour, impacting work, learning, entertainment and artistic creativity in profound ways.
 In Vietnam, AI is booming and becoming a pivotal technology in the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). 
 At the beginning of 2021, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh issued the National Strategy for Research, Development and Application of AI until 2030, aiming to make Vietnam a leader in Asean and establish 10 reputable AI brands by 2030. 
 This has attracted investment from both tech giants and innovative startups, creating new opportunities for groundbreaking projects and business models.
 Kai Yong Kang, business development manager for startups at Amazon Web Services, said that 2024 will be known as the “Year Of Products”. 
 Integration and AI use will become a widespread topic, extending beyond foundation models to encompass technologies like vector databases and orchestration engines.
 There is a mass inflow of investment in GenAI startups in top technology hubs like Silicon Valley and Europe, said Vy Le, chief executive officer of Do Ventures. 
 However, the rapidly evolving AI market should also be approached with caution in terms of partnerships. It is common for investment funds to make small initial investments or wait for technology maturity. 
 Key factors to evaluate AI start-ups include competitive advantage, revenue model and the team behind it, Vy added. 
 Laura Nguyen, a partner at GenAI Fund, stressed that the top concern for investment funds is to ensure the sustainability of GenAI startup business models. 
 This is particularly important in the presence of tech giants like Google and Microsoft, who have access to massive amounts of data. 
 She also highlighted the need for GenAI entrepreneurs to protect their businesses from market risks while fostering innovation and creativity.
 Experts are sharing optimistic insights on the progress of AI in Vietnam as technology companies make big investments. 
 Many university students are now GenAI founders and have already developed products that generate substantial revenues.
 Vietnam’s start-up ecosystem has progressed remarkably in recent years. 
 Experts highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment and infrastructure for startup development. 
 With a stable economy, a fast-growing ecosystem, a favourable startup environment, low costs and support from government policies and large corporations, AI startups are flourishing. 
 Vy from Do Ventures noted the benefits of collaborations between GenAI founders and major corporations, which provide extensive systems and data. And Vietnamese corporations have policies to foster partnerships with startups.
 Though the United States and China have a technological infrastructure advantage in AI, Vietnam can still compete in application development. 
 Valerie Vu, founder of Ansible Ventures, believes in the country’s talented engineers’ potential to create impactful AI applications.

686261,Main,14,28/05/2024,Beware of deceptive claims in AI industry,,"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) has been heralded as a transformative force that would revolutionise industries and drive unprecedented innovation. 
 But amid the enthusiasm, a trend known as “AI washing” has emerged. This practice involves companies overstating or misrepresenting the AI capabilities of their products or services, leading to potential deception. 
 AI washing is reminiscent of “greenwashing” from the early 2000s, where companies exaggerated their environmental efforts to attract environmentally conscious consumers. 
 In AI washing, companies often use ambiguous language and buzzwords like “intelligent”, “smart” or “AI-enhanced” without providing clear explanations or evidence of their products’ AI capabilities. 
 This deceptive marketing strategy not only misleads consumers but also distorts the competitive landscape, disadvantaging businesses that genuinely invest in AI research and development. 
 As consumers and businesses encounter more instances of AI washing, their trust in AI solutions diminishes. This can hold back the adoption of legitimate AI technologies. 
 Investors may also be misled into funding projects with overstated AI claims, thus diverting resources away from genuine innovations.
 AI washing could also affect  the regulatory landscape. Regulators could face difficulties in distinguishing between legitimate and deceptive AI claims, making it harder to establish effective policies and guidelines to govern AI deployment.
 A recent high-profile case that exemplifies the dangers of AI washing is the Rabbit R1 device. Marketed as a revolutionary AI-powered personal assistant, it promised unprecedented levels of interaction and automation. However, investigations revealed that the device’s functions were just basic automation. 
 AI systems are often deployed in critical applications such as healthcare, finance and security. Fraudulent AI claims in these sectors can lead to catastrophic consequences, including compromised data integrity, privacy breaches and even endangerment of human lives. 
 Governments and regulatory bodies need to establish clear guidelines and standards for AI claims. This includes defining what constitutes an AI system and setting benchmarks for performance and transparency. 
 Independent audits by third-party organisations can help verify AI claims. These audits should assess the validity of AI capabilities, performance metrics, and transparency of the processes. 
 Educating consumers about AI technologies can empower them to make informed decisions. Awareness campaigns and resources that explain AI concepts and red flags can help consumers identify and avoid deceptive AI claims. 
 It is imperative for businesses, regulators, investors and consumers to work together to ensure the integrity of AI development and deployment.

685803,Lifestyle,4,27/05/2024,Get ahead with AI,"Take advantage  of AI-driven tools to expedite and enhance a variety of tasks, whether for fun or work.","OPENAI’S ChatGPT took the world by storm in 2022, inspiring many others to develop generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools to capitalise on the craze.
 Since then, the tools available have expanded beyond chatbots to include AI-powered virtual assistants, content creation tools for social media and language translation services.
 Here are some noteworthy highlights worth exploring.
 Powering up productivity 
 Adobe now includes a built-in AI assistant in the free mobile version of its Acrobat PDF reader that is capable of summarising contents. 
 It will provide a detailed overview, complete with citation links to the parts of the document where the information is found.
 The AI can also answer questions about the document’s contents or even draft emails using information from the PDF.
 More recently, Adobe introduced AI features to its lightweight cloud-based app, Adobe Express, available for free on both computers and smartphones, giving users a taste of what the main, subscription-based creative suite has to offer.
 The all-in-one app incorporates video and photo editing and animation tools, with nifty AI features like object removal and replacement, along with automatic video captioning.
 The AI enhancements are quite powerful, producing convincing final images. For example, the object replacement tool can be used to change the colour of people’s shirts or what they are holding, while the removal tool is capable of getting rid of stray objects or people in a photo.
 Another neat feature of Express is the animate from audio tool, which offers users multiple preset characters that can be automatically lip-synced with the audio recording.
 There’s also the company’s free generative text-to-image AI tool, Firefly, which functions similar to Midjourney, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion.Online graphics tool Canva also offers AI-powered features for free, though it’s geared more towards photo editing than providing a more general set of tools like Express.
 Those looking to restore images taken with older cameras can check out simpler, web-based services like iloveimg.com and  letsenhance.io that are great for basic editing and upscaling. 
 On the productivity front, Google has been developing robust AI tools for its Workspace suite, encompassing apps such as Docs and Slides. However, these features are currently only available to a limited number of testers or through a subscription.
 But there are free alternatives available on the Workspace Marketplace, which can make a real difference in workflows and efficiency.
 One option is GPT Workspace, which works with Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, Drive, and even Gmail. The extension adds a sidebar, allowing users to input prompts or instructions into a chatbox for the AI.
 In Docs, it can handle tasks such as translations, fixing grammar and spelling, simplifying or better explaining portions of text, and making tonal changes. 
 In Slides, it can generate an entire slideshow from scratch, including text and AI-generated background images.
 It can also handle email responses in Gmail and read PDF documents, either uploaded directly to the sidebar or in Google Drive. The information from the PDF can, for instance, be used with Sheets to create a spreadsheet with additional formulas, tables and AI data analysis.
 Also, adding the browser extension for GPT Workspace to your Google Chrome can enhance your browsing experience. This extension provides webpage summarising capabilities similar to those found in Microsoft’s Bing Chat, available on Edge.
 Those more creatively inclined should pay a visit to Udio (udio.com), an AI music creation tool that generates songs from text prompts describing genres and instruments. Do note that specific artists’ names are off-limits.
 Udio can be used for free, though only a limited number of credits are given each day. Additional credits and a priority queue for tasks can be obtained through a monthly subscription, which starts at US$10 (RM46) per month.
 Google has a similar music generation tool called MusicFX that’s part of the company’s AI test kitchen. 
 The AI test kitchen also contains TextFX, a creative writing tool that helps with specific writing tasks, such as alliteration, visualising scenes, and creating similes. Additionally, it includes ImageFX, which functions like other generative image tools.
 Muze, on the other hand, is a free AI-powered music discovery website that can generate a list of songs depending on a user’s mood.
 Those in tertiary education can check out Semantic Scholar and Connected Papers, which use AI for researching academic articles.
 Connected Papers is capable of constructing a network of related academic works, including those cited by a specific paper and those citing that paper, providing a valuable resource for academics. 
 However, it is limited to handling five papers a month. Unlimited access requires a monthly subscription of US$3 (RM14). 
 Do keep in mind that, as with any AI product, it may miss certain things. 
 On the horizon
 In the wake of this year’s AI-centric Google I/O developer conference, it’s clear that there’s a lot more to come.
 Not only will we see more tools – like real-time scam alerts and greater integration of AI into Android – but also more services that will be able to identify AI-generated content.Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly making further plays in the AI space this year, with iOS 18 expected to add AI-powered features to notification, article summaries, voice memo transcriptions and photo editing, with Siri to get a new voice and more conversational tone.",openai chatgpt storm generative artificial intelligence tool capitalise craze tool chatbots virtual assistant content creation tool social medium language translation service noteworthy highlight productivity adobe assistant free mobile version acrobat pdf reader capable content detailed overview complete citation link document answer question document content draft pdf adobe feature cloud adobe express free computer user taste main subscription creative suite offer app video photo animation tool nifty feature removal replacement automatic video enhancement powerful final image replacement tool change colour people removal tool capable rid stray object people neat feature express animate audio tool user multiple character synced audio company free generative text image tool firefly function dall stable diffusion online graphic canva offer feature free photo set tool restore image simpler web service iloveimg letsenhance basic upscaling productivity front google robust tool suite apps doc slide feature tester free alternative marketplace real difference workflow efficiency option gpt workspace google sheet doc drive gmail extension sidebar user prompt instruction doc handle task translation grammar portion tonal slide entire slideshow scratch text background image email response pdf document sidebar google drive pdf instance sheet spreadsheet additional formula table data analysis browser extension gpt workspace chrome enhance experience extension webpage capability chat edge inclined pay visit udio udio music creation tool generates song text prompt genre instrument specific artist udio free limited credit day additional credit priority task monthly subscription month google music generation tool musicfx company test kitchen test kitchen creative tool specific task alliteration scene simile imagefx function generative image tool muze hand free music discovery website generate list song user mood tertiary education check semantic scholar paper academic article paper capable network academic specific paper paper valuable resource academic paper month unlimited access monthly subscription mind product horizon wake centric google developer conference lot tool real time scam alert integration android service content apple space io add powered feature notification article summary memo transcription siri voice conversational tone,"[(2, 0.99714035)]",2
685853,StarBiz,6,27/05/2024,Inculcating AI in business strategies is crucial to maximise growth,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) possesses the transformative power to elevate both efficiency and revenue in organisations, when harnessed effectively. 
 Achieving this success hinges on cultivating an environment that not only embraces AI but also trusts AI. As you embark on the journey to embed AI in your organisation, you need to reflect deeply on the following questions:
 Have you crafted an AI strategy that seeks transformative change, rather than just incremental improvements?
 AI offers exciting possibilities, yet it also carries inherent risks. What measures have you set in place to mitigate both internal and external threats?
 Human-AI collaboration is crucial for AI to be effective. How is your organisation fostering a culture where teams not only adopt but also trust and synergise with AI?
 This article addresses these essential topics and more, aiding board members by outlining some initial steps, posing critical questions, and highlighting considerations for effective AI implementation.
 Decoding the ‘Why’ of AI
 The Ernst & Young “CEO Outlook Pulse Survey” revealed that 76% of business leaders anticipate AI to principally boost efficiency, with minimal impact on revenue growth. However, a closer examination reveals that AI’s true potential spans far beyond mere operational optimisation. Its success lies in strategic adoption and application.
 Synergising AI, business strategies
 AI should not be an isolated venture but an integral part of overall business transformation. Start by intertwining your AI and corporate strategies, focusing on desired business outcomes. Successful AI programmes cut across organisational structures and are not confined to departmental initiatives.
 A transformational approach to AI encompasses complete value chains, fostering comprehensive rather than isolated improvements. 
 For instance, revamping an entire financial management process rather than expediting just one part can yield far more significant benefits. 
 An illustrative case of optimisation is that of a company seeking to reduce the time and effort required for its finance team to compile management reports. This task typically involves scrutinising competitor activities, crafting comparative analyses with industry peers, and analysing the data. 
 While the incorporation of AI yields some efficiencies in this specific process, the true potential of AI extends far beyond mere time management. For instance, AI could have been employed to provide strategic insights to enhance profit margins or identify and rectify potential revenue losses.
 Clear strategy ownership and outcome measurability are vital. Prioritise use cases that promise the most substantial impact, avoiding the trap of numerous proofs of concept.
 When aligning technology with strategy, discern whether to buy or build. Assess whether off-the-shelf solutions suffice, or if a bespoke approach would reap greater rewards.
 Boards may wish to ask: 
 > Is our AI strategy aligned to the business strategy? 
 > Is it transformative across entire value chains with trackable and quantifiable benefits?
 > Who is responsible for the AI strategy and execution?
 > Is there a clear strategy on technology (buy vs build)? 
 > Are all foundational elements – data, business processes, governance – in place to support the AI strategy?
 Navigating AI risks
 Delving into AI also means confronting the spectrum of associated risks – data privacy, ethical quandaries, and stringent regulatory landscapes. Then comes the looming question: If your AI system malfunctions, what then? Implementing robust checks and balances is non-negotiable to mitigate the possibility of misinformation.
 Boards may wish to ask: 
 > What controls are in place to govern AI? Is there a rollback strategy?
 > What does your responsible AI framework look like? 
 > What external risks, laws and regulations must you consider? 
 > What is the environmental impact of your AI strategy implementation? 
 > How autonomous is your AI? What human interventions are in place?
 The crux of AI transformation lies not only in technology but also in people. Upskilling staff and reshaping interactions with suppliers and customers are foundational. As AI redefines roles, redirecting your workforce’s potential to areas where they continue to add value is essential.
 Boards may wish to ask:
 > How does AI change the way our people work, and our interactions with suppliers and customers? 
 > How do we use trusted, responsible AI to drive brand value with customers, suppliers and our people? 
 > How are we going to upskill, reskill and redeploy our people to drive value?
 > How do we change people’s behaviors so that they embrace, use and trust AI?
 AI transcends industries and borders, and it is here to stay. How organisations take advantage of it is open to debate. No matter what your business strategy, we believe there is merit in assessing the value of an AI strategy to drive real business outcomes. Learn first, test second, then scale up, once the value is clear.

685967,Main,10,27/05/2024,Need for code of ethics on AI,Abang Jo urges media to set guidelines to tackle challenges posed by new tech,"KUCHING: The media profession should come up with a code of ethics that advocates responsible use of digital tools and technology, says Tan Sri Abang Johari Openg.
 The Sarawak Premier said this was one way of tackling the challenges posed by new and evolving technology.
 “The transformation of communication due to digitalisation is happening rapidly and this leads to challenges for the media industry.
 “There must be proper procedures in managing and disseminating information.
 “My suggestion is a code of  ethics drawn up by journalists themselves with a responsibility towards ensuring the well-being of the nation and mankind  in general,” he told reporters  after opening the inaugural Sarawak Media Conference here  yesterday.
 Abang Johari cited artificial intelligence (AI) as a new  techno­logy that should be monitored.
 “For example, generative AI can be misused to create false information. It can be difficult to evaluate whether information is genuine,” he said.
 The two-day conference  was organised by the Sarawak Public Communications Unit and Kuching Division Journalists Association in conjunction with the National Journalists Day (Hawana) celebration taking place here.
 In his speech earlier,  Abang Johari called on the  global media industry to have a code of ethics on the use of digital tools.
 “This is important to ensure that the media will use technolo­gical tools professionally, without misusing them for other  agendas.
 “I am pleased Malaysia is looking towards this and I hope  the global media industry will come up with an acceptable code,” he said.
 Abang Johari also said the Sarawak government welcomed input from the media industry towards providing credible  information in tandem with the state’s development.
 He said Sarawak is moving forward through its post-Covid development strategy which  is based on economic pros­perity, social inclusivity and environmental sustainability.

685501,StarEdu,8,26/05/2024,Dealing with AI in academia,,"The encroachment of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education is inevitable. 
 While embracing AI poses risks, it also offers unprecedented benefits. Dealing with AI therefore calls for measures to mitigate risks and capitalise on opportunities. 
 In academia, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has sparked much debate.
 Generative AI is the use of AI to create new content, such as text and images. It uses machine learning to discern patterns and relationships in human-input datasets. 
 Once it learns these patterns, the technology can generate new content with promptings by humans. 
 Many recognise the benefits of AI in education. One of its most significant advantages is its ability to automate administrative tasks, allowing academics more time to focus on high-value student interactions. The most commonly reported benefit of generative AI tools is time-saving. Many educators are already using generative AI to create lesson plans and develop student learning tasks.
 Lecturers can use generative AI to create curriculum summaries, assessment rubrics, discussion topics, student lesson plans, learning resources and classroom activities. 
 Generative AI can be used together with the university management system to streamline tasks. Using AI tools alongside continuous quality improvement methods can significantly reduce teacher planning workloads.
 Generative AI also increases the efficiency of marking and feedback processes. 
 It’s not only the lecturers who gain from using generative AI. 
 Studies have shown its potential to personalise lesson plans for students with literacy and learning difficulties, with reported positive outcomes from such approaches.
 The biggest fear surrounding generative AI revolves around the rise of cheating cases. Many worry that it might hinder students’ critical thinking. 
 Sceptics argue that there is a possibility that AI will lead to a downgrading of human skills. 
 The use of generative AI could also lead to complacency, as there is a risk that students may become dependent on AI technology. 
 There are additional concerns around ethical issues such as inherent bias and data privacy. But many feel generative AI can benefit the student learning experience and foster creativity. 
 This means schools need an AI policy that includes guidelines for responsible use, addressing potential risks and defining what responsible use entails. It should also cover issues of bias and errors, including ethical considerations related to plagiarism and the proper use of secondary sources. 
 It has been suggested that AI policies must clearly state how the faculty intends to use AI tools and demonstrate a commitment to their fair and safe usage. 
 Lecturers should know what’s expected of them and how they can effectively use AI in the classroom to support learning.
 For example, ChatGPT can be treated similarly to calculators, being permitted for certain assignments but not for others. 
 Another approach is to allow students to use generative AI for specific parts of the task. For example, students can use ChatGPT to create outlines for their essays, then put their devices away and write their essays independently. This teaches students how to interact with AI and ask the right questions. 
 For today’s students, who will graduate into a world filled with generative AI programs, these are critical skills to learn. It’s worth remembering we’re in the early days of AI, and the technology is in a perpetual state of evolution. 
 By staying informed about the latest advancements, everyone can anticipate critical changes and adapt accordingly. Whatever it is, we need to deal with AI to create more positive outcomes for education. AI is here to stay.PROF DATUK DR AHMAD IBRAHIM

685313,Main,26,25/05/2024,White House seeks tech firms help to curb AI sexual exploitation,,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing the tech industry and financial institutions to shut down a growing market of abusive sexual images made with artificial intelligence technology.
 New generative AI tools have made it easy to transform someone’s likeness into a sexually explicit AI deepfake and share the realistic images across chatrooms or social media. The victims – be they celebrities or children – have little recourse to stop it.
 The White House is putting out a call looking for voluntary cooperation from companies in the absence of federal legislation. 
 By committing to a set of specific measures, officials hope the private sector can curb the creation, spread and monetisation of such non-consensual AI images, inclu­ding explicit images of children.
 “As generative AI broke on the scene, everyone was speculating about where the first real harms would come. I think we have the answer,” said Biden’s chief science adviser Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.
 She described a “phenomenal acceleration” of non-consensual imagery fuelled by AI tools and largely targeting women and girls in a way that can upend their lives.“If you’re a teenage girl or a gay kid, these are problems that people are experiencing right now,” she said. 
 “We’ve seen an acceleration because of generative AI that’s moving really fast. And the fastest thing that can happen is for companies to step up and take responsibility.”
 A document shared with AP ahead of its release yesterday calls for action from not just AI developers but payment processors, financial institutions, cloud computing providers, search engines and the gatekeepers – namely Apple and Google – that control what makes it onto mobile app stores.
 The private sector should step up to “disrupt the monetisation” of image-based sexual abuse, restricting payment access particularly to sites that advertise explicit images of minors, the administration said.
 Prabhakar said many payment platforms and financial institutions already say that they won’t support the kinds of businesses promoting abusive imagery.
 “But sometimes it’s not enforced; sometimes they don’t have those terms of service,” she said. “And so that’s an example of something that could be done much more rigorously.” — AP",washington president joe administration tech industry financial institution market abusive sexual image artificial intelligence technology generative tool easy transform likeness explicit share realistic image social medium victim celebrity child white house call voluntary cooperation company federal legislation specific measure official private sector curb creation spread monetisation consensual image explicit image child scene real harm biden chief science adviser arati prabhakar director white house office science technology policy phenomenal acceleration consensual imagery tool woman girl teenage girl gay kid people acceleration generative fastest happen company responsibility document release yesterday action developer payment processor financial institution provider engine gatekeeper apple google control mobile app store private sector step disrupt monetisation image sexual abuse payment access site explicit image minor administration payment platform financial institution support business abusive imagery term service,"[(2, 0.99311036)]",2
685473,StarBiz 7,12,25/05/2024,Impact of AI on jobs,,"FAR from heralding the end of jobs, artificial intelligence (AI) signals the start of a new era in which workers can be more productive and valuable than ever.
 Al does more than help workers do the old things faster as it opens the door to new business models and ways of creating value.
 The implications for businesses are huge as AI delivers significant top and bottom line benefits, increasing profitability and revenue.
 Sectors that are especially exposed to AI are experiencing nearly five times higher growth in labour productivity. 
 Rising labour productivity is a key driver of economic growth and increasing living standards, according to PwC in its inaugural 2024 Global AI jobs barometer report.
 For a worker, it means adapting to a changing job market as the skills required by employers in AI-exposed occupations are changing fast. 
 Old skills are disappearing from job ads and new skills are appearing faster in AI roles than in roles less exposed to it, says PwC.
 The jobs carry up to a 25% wage premium on average, underlining the value of the skills to companies, according to the report.

684927,StarBiz,4,24/05/2024,Nvidia delivers on AI hype by igniting US$140bil stock rally,,"NVIDIA Corp, the chipmaker at the centre of an artificial intelligence (AI) boom, gained in late trading after a bullish sales forecast showed that AI computing spending remains strong.
 Second-quarter revenue will be about US$28bil, topping the US$26.8bil predicted by analysts. Results in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 28, also beat projections – lifted by growth in Nvidia’s data-centre division.
 The big question heading into the earnings report was whether Nvidia’s latest numbers could justify the dizzying run-up in its stock. The shares had gained 92% this year through Wednesday’s close, fuelled by investor hopes that the company would continue to shatter expectations.The report didn’t disappoint, and chief executive officer Jensen Huang stoked the excitement by talking about the dawning of a new era. 
 “This is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,” he said in an interview, echoing one of his favourite themes. 
 “This is really exciting.”
 The upbeat outlook reinforces Nvidia’s status as the biggest beneficiary of AI spending. The company’s so-called AI accelerators –chips that help data centres develop chatbots and other cutting-edge tools – have become a hot commodity in the past two years, sending its sales soaring. Nvidia’s market valuation has skyrocketed as well, topping US$2.3 trillion.
 In the fiscal first quarter, Nvidia’s revenue more than tripled to US$26bil. Excluding certain items, profit was US$6.12 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about US$24.7bil and earnings of US$5.65 a share.
 The shares rose as much as 7.8% in extended trading on Wednesday, taking them above US$1,000 for the first time. The Santa Clara, California-based company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 US cents a share.
 The rally helped lift the shares of other companies associated with AI. Super Micro Computer Inc, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Dell Technologies Inc all gained in the wake of the results.
 Huang, in his signature black leather jacket, has become a celebrity in the AI era. 
 His company, which he co-founded in 1993, started as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. But he recognised that Nvidia’s chips were well-suited to developing AI software and that helped open a new market – and gave him a jump on competitors.
 The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in 2022 then sparked a race between major technology companies to build their own AI infrastructure. The scramble made Nvidia’s H100 accelerators a must-have product. They sell for tens of thousands of dollars per chip and are often in scarce supply.
 For now, much of this new revenue comes from a small handful of customers. 
 A group of four companies –Amazon.com Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google – are Nvidia’s largest buyers and have accounted for about 40% of sales. 
 Huang, 61, is trying to spread his bets by producing complete computers, software and services – aimed at helping more corporations and government agencies deploy their own AI systems.
 Nvidia’s data-centre division –now by far its largest source of sales – generated US$22.6bil of revenue last quarter. 
 Gaming chips provided US$2.6bil. Analysts had given targets of US$21bil for the data-centre unit and US$2.6bil for gaming.If the after-hours stock gain holds up in regular trading yesterday, Nvidia will add roughly US$140bil to its valuation. 
 That’s greater than the entire market capitalisation of Intel Corp, a chipmaker that once dwarfed Nvidia by every measure. And Nvidia’s US$28bil in projected quarterly sales would be more than twice what Intel is expected to report. 
 Wider market
 Nvidia has emphasised that it wants to sell its technology to a wider market – expanding beyond the giant cloud-computing providers known as hyperscalers. Huang said that AI is moving to consumer Internet companies, carmakers, biotechnology and health-care customers. Countries also are developing their own systems – a trend referred to as sovereign AI.
 These opportunities are creating multiple multibillion-dollar markets beyond cloud service providers, he said.
 The large-scale deployment of Nvidia chips by Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc is one sign of that expansion. 
 The automaker is using Nvidia gear to develop software that will operate self-driving vehicles.
 Still, hyperscalers remained a critical growth driver for Nvidia last quarter. They generated 45% of the company’s data-centre revenue. That suggests Nvidia is in the early stages of diversifying the business.
 The company’s new chip platform, called Blackwell, is now in full production, Huang said. And it lays the groundwork for generative AI that can handle trillions of parameters. 
 Next wave of growth
 “We are poised for our next wave of growth,” he said.
 The company will get “a lot” of its 2024 revenue from the new Blackwell chips, Huang said. But customers aren’t easing up on orders for its existing products – a concern among some analysts. Those buyers need the current generation to help them build out their infrastructure as quickly as possible, he said. 
 Demand for Nvidia’s products has outpaced supply, and Huang expects that to remain the case into next year. The company is also contending with other challenges: The increasing complexity of its technology, which now includes complete computer systems, means that its supply chain has become much more complicated, he said. That makes it more difficult to increase output. — Bloomberg

685177,Main,27,24/05/2024,Schuey’s family get ‘paid’ for  AI ‘interview’,,"MONACO: Michael Schumacher’s family has secured US$216,360 (RM1.02mil) compensation from the publishers of a German magazine that printed an AI-generated ‘interview’ with the seven- time Formula One world champion.
 A family spokeswoman on Wednesday confirmed a Munich Labour Court judgement and settlement by Funke media group, publishers of the magazine Die Aktuelle, without making any further comment.
 The magazine’s editor was sacked last year, with Funke apologising to Schumacher’s family.
 Ferrari great Schumacher, now 55, has not been seen in public since he suffered a serious brain injury in a skiing accident on a family holiday in the French Alps in December 2013.
 Schumacher’s family maintains strict privacy about the former driver’s condition, with access limited to those closest to him.

684621,StarBiz,10,23/05/2024,Altman says AI is ‘safe enough’ as scandals raise concerns,,"Seattle: OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman defended his company’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology as safe for widespread use, as concerns mount over potential risks and lack of proper safeguards for ChatGPT-style AI systems.
 Altman’s remarks came at a Microsoft event in Seattle, where he spoke to developers just as a new controversy erupted over an OpenAI AI voice that closely resembled that of the actress Scarlett Johansson.
 The chief executive, who rose to global prominence after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, is also grappling with questions about the safety of the company’s AI following the departure of the team responsible for mitigating long-term AI risks.
 “My biggest piece of advice is this is a special time and take advantage of it,” Altman told the audience of developers seeking to build new products using OpenAI’s technology.
 “This is not the time to delay what you’re planning to do or wait for the next thing,” he added.
 OpenAI is a close partner of Microsoft and provides the foundational technology, primarily the GPT-4 large language model, for building AI tools.
 Microsoft has jumped on the AI bandwagon, pushing out new products and urging users to embrace generative AI’s capabilities.
 “We kind of take it for granted that GPT-4, while far from perfect ... is generally considered robust enough and safe enough for a wide variety of uses”, Altman said.
 Altman insisted that OpenAI had put in “a huge amount of work” to ensure the safety of its models.
 “When you take a medicine, you want to know what’s going to be safe, and with our model, you want to know it’s going to be robust to behave the way you want it to,” he added.
 However, questions about OpenAI’s commitment to safety resurfaced last week when the company dissolved its “superalignment” group, a team dedicated to mitigating the long-term dangers of AI.
 In announcing his departure, team co-leader Jan Leike criticised OpenAI for prioritising “shiny new products” over safety in a series of posts on X.
 “Over the past few months, my team has been sailing against the wind,” Leike said.
 “These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren’t on a trajectory to get there.”
 This controversy was swiftly followed by a public statement from Johansson, who expressed outrage over a voice used by OpenAI’s ChatGPT that sounded similar to her voice in the 2013 film Her.
 The voice in question, called “Sky” was featured last week in the release of OpenAI’s more human-like GPT-4o model.
 In a short statement on Tuesday, Altman apologised to Johansson but insisted the voice was not based on hers. — AFP",seattle penai chief executive officer altman company artificial intelligence technology safe widespread concern potential risk proper safeguard chatgpt style system altman remark microsoft event seattle developer openai voice actress scarlett johansson chief executive global prominence openai chatgpt question safety company departure team responsible term risk biggest piece advice special time advantage altman audience developer build product technology time delay wait close partner microsoft foundational technology gpt language model tool bandwagon product user generative capability gpt perfect robust safe wide variety altman altman huge amount safety model safe model robust question commitment safety week company superalignment team term danger departure team leader jan leike openai shiny product safety series month wind leike hard concerned trajectory controversy public statement johansson outrage voice openai chatgpt voice film voice question sky week release openai human gpt model short statement tuesday altman johansson insisted voice afp,"[(2, 0.99367285)]",2
684329,StarBiz,11,22/05/2024,Microsoft debuts Copilot+  PCs with AI features,New addition to fuel strong profit growth for the firm,"SEATTLE: Microsoft debuted a new category of personal computers (PCs) with artificial intelligence (AI) features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple .
 At an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, chief executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls “Copilot+” PCs, said it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer.
 Microsoft launched the laptops as its shares traded near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals.
 Able to handle more AI tasks without calling on cloud data centres, the new computers will start at US$1,000 and begin shipping on June 18.
 The ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called “Recall” 
 “Recall” tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.
 The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the Minecraft video game.
 Yusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. 
 At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be “the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.”
 Global PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.
 “People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,” said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.
 Microsoft’s new “Copilot+” computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the “Ultrabook” category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple’s MacBook Air. 
 Microsoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, would “soon” be available as part of Copilot.
 Microsoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings’ architecture. 
 It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.
 Microsoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. 
 Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.
 After Intel’s processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.
 The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft’s Copilot software.
 Microsoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.
 Microsoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its deal with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.
 Last week, OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. 
 Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.
 Windows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel’s processors. — Reuters",seattle category personal computer artificial intelligence rush technology product business apple event campus redmond washington chief executive satya nadella microsoft call copilot pc manufacturer acer computer microsoft share record wall street driven expectation fuel strong profit growth company tech rival task cloud data computer june ability crunch data computer copilot feature recall recall track computer voice chat history computer user search month company copilot voice assistant real time virtual coach user playing minecraft video game yusuf mehdi head consumer marketing microsoft company pc press event assistant reason upgrade time global shipment firm gartner microsoft category computer pc people convinced device experience justifies category copilot machine analyst ben creative strategy copilot computer marketing category highlight feature reminiscent ultrabook category thin form laptop intel manufacturer apple macbook air microsoft executive technology chatgpt maker openai copilot microsoft generation surface pro tablet surface laptop feature chip arm holding architecture technology prism software intel amd chip chip arm technology microsoft device action apple device photo software adobe microsoft device apple month chip analyst future laptop intel processor market decade maker lower power arm component window market qualcomm elite chip neural processing unit accelerate application microsoft copilot software microsoft product event day annual developer conference microsoft aim advantage race tool consumer deal openai jump alphabet race dominate field week google technology voice real time hallmark realistic voice conversation voice assistant google generative feature search engine maker pressure apple company custom chip design arm intel processor reuters,"[(2, 0.47372857), (4, 0.52312535)]",4
684491,Main,22,22/05/2024,Saudis on AI spending blitz,,"ON a Monday morning in March, tech executives, engineers and sales representatives from Amazon, Google, TikTok and other companies endured a three-hour traffic jam as their cars crawled toward a mammoth conference at an event space  in the desert, 80km outside Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 The lure – billions of dollars in Saudi money as the kingdom seeks to build a tech industry to complement its oil  dominance.
 “To the Future,” a sign read on the approach to the event, called Leap.
 More than 200,000 people converged at the conference, including Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon’s cloud computing division, who announced a US$5.3bil investment in Saudi Arabia for data centres and artificial intelligence technology. Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, spoke of what a government minister called a “lifetime friendship” with the kingdom. Executives from Huawei and dozens of other firms made speeches.
 More than US$10bil in deals were done there, according to Saudi Arabia’s state press agency.
 “This is a great country,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said during the conference, heralding the video app’s growth in the kingdom. “We expect to invest even more.”
 Everybody in tech seems to want to make friends with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom trains its sights on becoming a dominant player in AI – and is pumping in eye-popping sums to do so.
 Saudi Arabia created a US$100bil fund this year to invest in AI and other technology. It is in talks with Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and other investors to put an additional US$40bil into AI companies.
 In March, the government said it would invest US$1bil in a Silicon Valley-inspired startup accelerator to lure AI entrepreneurs to the kingdom.
 The initiatives easily dwarf those of most major nation-state investments.
 The spending blitz stems from a generational effort outlined in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and known as “Vision 2030”. Saudi Arabia is racing to diversify its oil-rich economy in areas like tech, tourism, culture and sports – investing a reported US$200mil a year for football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and planning a 160km-long mirrored skyscraper in the desert.
 For the tech industry, Saudi Arabia has long been a funding spigot. But the kingdom is now redirecting its oil wealth into building a domestic tech industry, requiring international firms to establish roots there if they want its money.
 If Crown Prince Mohammed succeeds, he will place Saudi Arabia in the middle of an escalating global competition among China, the United States and other countries like France that have made breakthroughs in generative AI. Combined with AI efforts by its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia’s plan has the potential to create a new power centre in the global tech industry.
 In Washington, many worry that the kingdom’s goals and authoritarian leanings could work against US interests – for instance, if Saudi Arabia ends up providing computing power to Chinese researchers and companies. The White House brokered a deal recently for Microsoft to invest in G42, an AI company in the UAE, which was intended partly to diminish China’s influence.
 For China, the Persian Gulf region offers a big market, access to deep-pocketed investors and a chance to wield influence in countries traditionally allied with the United States.
 Some industry leaders have begun to arrive.
 Jürgen Schmidhuber, an AI pioneer  who now heads an AI programme at Saudi Arabia’s premier research university, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, recalled the kingdom’s roots centuries ago as a centre for science and mathematics.
 “It would be lovely to contribute to a new world and resurrect this golden age,” he said. “Yes, it will cost money, but there’s a lot of money in this country.”
 The university, known as KAUST, has become a site of the US-Chinese technological showdown.
 Modelled on universities like the California Institute of Technology, KAUST is the kingdom’s premier scientific research school, bringing in foreign AI leaders and providing computing resources to build an epicentre for AI research.
 To achieve that aim, KAUST has often turned to China to recruit students and professors and to strike research partnerships, alarming US officials. They fear  students and professors from Chinese  military-linked universities will use KAUST to sidestep US sanctions and boost China in the race for AI supremacy,  analysts and US officials said.
 Of particular concern is the university’s construction of one of the region’s fastest supercomputers, which needs thousands of microchips made by Nvidia, the biggest maker of precious chips that power  AI systems.
 The university’s chip order, with an estimated value of more than US$100mil,  is being held up by a review from the US government, which must provide an export licence before the sale can go through.
 Schmidhuber is awaiting the completion of the supercomputer, Shaheen 3, which is a chance to attract more top talent to the Persian Gulf and to give researchers access to computing power often reserved for major companies.
 “No other university is going to have a similar thing,” he said.
 Some in Washington fear the supercomputer may provide researchers from Chinese universities access to cutting-edge computing resources they would not have in China. More than a dozen students and staff members at KAUST are from military-linked Chinese universities known as the Seven Sons of National Defence, according to a review by The New York Times.
 Schmidhuber said the Saudi government was ultimately aligned with the United States. Just as US technology helped create Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, it will play a critical role in AI development.

683939,StarBiz,13,21/05/2024,Gen AI falling short of businesses’ expectations,"After big debut, impact for productivity gains still lagging","SINGAPORE: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) promised a roaring business revolution, but 18 months after ChatGPT’s big-bang debut, its impact is more like a whimper.
 Enterprises had underestimated what they needed to use gen AI and overrated its impact on businesses, observers said.
 Consultancy firm McKinsey, which in July 2023 projected gen AI to add a US$4.4 trillion bump to global corporate profits annually, said in April that adoption among corporations has not gone far beyond Gen AI pilots and a few use cases or situations in which the technology could be used.
 Gayatri Shenai, a senior partner at the firm, said in a webinar: “The value really comes from enterprise-wide adoption and scale. And here, most organisations are struggling.”
 The hubris following ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022 might explain a few let-downs.
 Some of the test projects that firms picked in 2023 were not scalable – like launching Gen AI for a function performed by eight people – and would not have delivered value, said Matthew Candy, IBM Consulting’s global managing partner for Gen AI.
 “There was pressure, questions being asked from above, and lots of people were feeling like they’ve got to do something, show something,” he said.
 Results of a poll of 300 executives by the MIT Technology Review Insights for Telstra International in late 2023 found that first adopters of Gen AI reported lower confidence in their firm’s technology than others.
 Commenting on the findings, MIT Sloan School research fellow Michael Schrage said: “It is disappointing how tactical that experimentation has been. Too many experts look at Gen AI as a way of automating or augmenting existing workflows and processes, rather than rethinking use case fundamentals or the desired outputs and outcomes they really want.”
 Hallucination – the inclination of Gen AI to fabricate stuff based on probability – is a major obstacle.
 OCBC Bank, which launched a ChatGPT bot in October 2023, has 250 AI models and a 150-strong data science and engineering team that oversees them.
 It uses a multitude of tools to test the accuracy, limitations and biases of its large language models.
 Donald MacDonald, the bank’s head of group data office, conceded: “Gen AI got many companies excited with the possibilities, but they are now finding it challenging to deploy in production.”
 Organisations are also falling short of AI enablers – such as an AI strategy, talent, data, infrastructure, operating models and culture.
 Firms need to have a fit-for-purpose data architecture, sufficient computing power and robust connectivity to handle the immense data volumes, said Geraldine Kor, Telstra International’s head of global enterprise.
 Data that is good enough to generate real-time insights is another top constraint.
 In a survey conducted by Salesforce and YouGov around March, about eight in every 10 Singapore workers said the data ingested by their AI models must be accurate, comprehensive and secure, before they would use them with trust.
 “For real-world applications, we simply cannot rely on luck. We need people to trust the technology,” Professor Lam Kwok Yan, a cyber-security expert from the school of computing at Nanyang Technological University, said at a conference on May 7.
 Then there is the shortage of AI talent, with no short-term relief in sight.
 In a global poll of 2,000 executives in nine developed economies by recruiter Adecco and Oxford Economics in late 2023, Singapore topped the list for employers who planned to hire AI talent from outside their firms.
 Given that in 2023, 34% of resident employees lasted only one to five years in a job, Betul Genc, Adecco’s head of Asean, was not surprised. Managers may find it more financially viable to hire over reskilling, she said, even if that is not sustainable.
 She said: “This approach risks creating a skills shortage that may drive salaries upwards, intensifying competition in the job market.”
 Still, employers are too tied up with the AI rat race to focus on training their employees, according to another study by workforce solutions provider Persolkelly.
 In its February survey, only 27% of local employers said they have a comprehensive plan to help employees replaced by Gen AI find new jobs, compared with the Asia-Pacific regional average of 36%.
 “Despite being acknowledged as the company’s most significant asset, employees are nevertheless frequently disregarded,” it wrote in the report.
 The question is how many businesses will be ready to deploy Gen AI effectively.
 Workers will remain at the core.
 Brad Anderson, president of products, user experience and engineering at experience management firm Qualtrics, said: “Qualtrics research shows that Singaporeans are some of the most open to using and engaging with AI globally. But when we look at how they want to use AI, it’s clear that customers and employees want AI in the passenger seat assisting them, not the driver’s seat replacing them.”
 Clients are using its AI tools to push up customer responses to human agents, and help managers act on both customer and staff feedback, he added.
 Businesses will find out that a patchwork of models and technologies, and not one Gen AI model, is what they need, IBM’s Candy said.
 He said: “People are starting to realise the complexity of the landscape that’s going to evolve, and therefore the need to think about how I govern it, how I manage it, how I build a fabric and a layer that can connect all of these different technologies and skills.”
 Companies without data good enough to use Gen AI might start in areas where data reliability is less critical, suggested Sujith Abraham, general manager of Salesforce in Asean.
 “For instance, account summaries or case summaries are not as reliant on data quality. Businesses can start there and continue to improve and refine its data by experimentation,” he said.
 Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said many small and medium enterprises are using gen AI tools for personal productivity tasks rather than job or process transformation.
 These firms could integrate gen AI into business processes, such as enhancing customer service through sentiment analysis or for swift and accurate first-level customer inquiries.

 The meeting is a follow-up to the inaugural global AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in Britain last year, where dozens of countries voiced their fears to leading AI firms about the risks posed by their tech.
 Safety is again on the agenda at the AI Seoul Summit starting today and representatives are expected from leading AI firms, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Google DeepMind, French AI firm Mistral, Microsoft and Anthropic.
 “As with any new technology, AI brings new risks, including deliberate misuse from those who mean to do us harm,” South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said yesterday in a joint article.
 “However, with new models being released almost every week, we are still learning where these risks may emerge,” they said in the piece, published by the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo and Britain’s i newspaper.
 The stratospheric success of ChatGPT soon after its 2022 release sparked a gold rush in generative AI, with tech firms around the world pouring billions of dollars into developing their own models.
 Generative AI models can gene­rate text, photos, audio and even video from simple prompts, and its proponents have heralded them as a breakthrough that will improve lives and businesses around the world.
 But critics, rights activists and governments have warned that they can be misused in a wide variety of situations, including the manipulation of voters through fake news stories or so-called “deepfake” pictures and videos of politicians.
 Many have called for international standards to govern the development and use of AI.
 “When we meet with companies at the AI Seoul Summit, we will ask them to do more to show how they assess and respond to risk within their organisations,” Yoon and Sunak wrote. — AFP",south korea britain kick major international summit artificial intelligence seoul week government press tech firm safety meeting follow inaugural global safety summit park britain dozen country fear firm risk tech safety agenda seoul summit representative firm chatgpt maker google deepmind french firm mistral microsoft anthropic technology brings risk deliberate misuse harm south korean president yoon suk yeol prime minister rishi sunak yesterday joint article model week risk piece south korean daily joongang ilbo newspaper stratospheric success chatgpt release gold rush generative tech firm billion dollar model generative model gene rate photo audio video simple prompt proponent improve life business critic right activist government misused wide variety situation manipulation voter news story deepfake picture politician international standard govern development meet company seoul summit respond risk organisation sunak afp,"[(3, 0.99311495)]",3

 “We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” she told the event organised by the Swiss Institute of International Studies, associated to the University of Zurich.
 “It could bring tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society.”
 Georgieva said the world economy had become more prone to shocks in recent years, citing the global pandemic in 2020, as well as the war in Ukraine.
 Although she expected more shocks, particularly due to the climate crisis, the world remained remarkably resilient, she said.
 “We are not in global recession,” said Georgieva, who was heckled by protesters calling for action on climate change and tackling developing world debt.

681157,StarBiz,12,14/05/2024,Central bank has AI in  its intervention corner,Stocks cap a third straight week of net inflows,"TAIPEI: As a strong US dollar drives up currency volatility across Asia, an artificial intelligence-fuelled tech boom has offered Taiwan some reprieve. 
 The local currency weakened less than the South Korean won and Japanese yen in April, a turbulent month for the region as Federal Reserve (Fed) policy bets shifted. 
 That relative strength came even as authorities kept the amount of intervention “similar to” the previous two months, according to a central bank official. 
 Analysts attributed the resilience to a tech-led exports recovery that’s allowing a steady supply of the US dollar, and an equities rebound driven by foreign inflows. 
 Taiwanese stocks capped a third straight week of net inflows and the local benchmark has outperformed peers since mid-April, exchange data showed. 
 “Taiwan doesn’t need to step up intervention like Japan due to a rebound in the electronics and semiconductor industries,” Eugene Tsai, head of the foreign exchange department at Taiwan’s central bank, said in a press briefing last week. 
 He added that US dollar supply was “relatively stable.” 
 A gauge measuring swings in the Taiwan dollar over a rolling 30-day period, known as the historical volatility, trails that of the won and the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 The local currency fell 1.7% against the greenback in April, less than the won and the yen, whose slump spurred verbal warnings from authorities in South Korea and suspected intervention in Japan during the month. 
 The two countries even teamed up to air concerns over their currency weakness in mid-April, while Bank Indonesia hiked rates in a surprise move to defend the rupiah.  
 In contrast, officials in Taiwan have refrained from sending as strong a message to the market. 
 Taiwan’s central bank “didn’t need to intervene too much because local equities performance is good,” said Ju Wang, head of greater China foreign exchange and rates strategy at BNP Paribas SA. 
 In a separate note, the brokerage said a lack of financial instability and a stable foreign exchange supply due to the exports recovery have allowed the central bank to “keep a relatively hands-off stance”. 
 Taiwan’s exports to the United States jumped 81.6% year-on-year to US$10.2bil in April, driven by shipments of information, communication and audio-video products. 
 Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which assembles the majority of Apple Inc’s smartphones, is among the biggest contributors to the equity benchmark Taiex index’s rebound since April 22.  
 Policymakers’ stance on currency, however, may shift if the US dollar resumes its uptrend, or foreigners’ turn their back against the local stock market. 
 If Fed speakers continue to guide markets to price in later or fewer interest rate cuts, or even a hike, then US dollar strength may return and that would mean officials may still need to be active on intervention, according to Christopher Wong, a foreign exchange strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. — Bloomberg",taipei strong dollar drive currency volatility artificial intelligence tech boom taiwan local currency south korean japanese yen april turbulent month region federal reserve fed policy bet relative strength authority previous month central bank official analyst resilience tech export recovery steady supply dollar equity foreign inflow taiwanese stock straight week net inflow local benchmark peer mid exchange data taiwan step intervention japan electronics semiconductor industry tsai head foreign exchange department central bank press week dollar supply stable gauge swing dollar day period historical volatility yen data bloomberg local currency april yen verbal warning authority korea intervention japan month country air concern currency weakness april bank indonesia rate defend rupiah contrast official strong message market taiwan central bank intervene local equity performance wang head foreign exchange rate strategy paribas separate note brokerage lack financial instability stable foreign exchange supply export recovery central bank hand stance taiwan export bil april driven shipment communication video product hai precision industry majority apple smartphones biggest contributor equity benchmark taiex rebound policymakers stance currency dollar resume foreigner local stock market speaker guide market price fewer rate cut dollar strength return official active intervention christopher foreign exchange strategist chinese banking corp bloomberg,"[(0, 0.118309334), (4, 0.51668215), (5, 0.36187127)]",4
680571,Lifestyle,6,13/05/2024,AI takes flight,"An AI-controlled fighter jet took a US Air  Force leader for a historic ride, heralding a new chapter in autonomous aerial combat.","WITH the midday sun blazing, an experimental orange and white F-16 fighter jet launched with a familiar roar that is a hallmark of US airpower.
 But the aerial combat that followed was unlike any other: This F-16 was controlled by artificial intelligence (AI), not a human pilot. And riding in the front seat was Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall.
 AI marks one of the biggest advances in military aviation since the introduction of stealth in the early 1990s, and the Air Force has aggressively leaned in. Even though the technology is not fully developed, the service is planning for an AI-enabled fleet of more than 1,000 unmanned warplanes, the first of which will operate by 2028.It was fitting that the dogfight took place at Edwards Air Force Base, a vast desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the speed of sound and the military incubated its most secret aerospace advances. Inside classified simulators and buildings with layers of shielding against surveillance, a new test-pilot generation is training AI agents to fly in war.
 Kendall travelled here to see AI fly in real time and make a public statement of confidence in its future role in air combat.
 “It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,” Kendall said in an interview after he landed. 
 The AP, along with NBC, was granted permission to witness the secret flight on the condition that it would not be reported until it was complete because of operational security concerns.The AI-controlled F-16, called Vista, flew Kendall in lightning- fast manoeuvres at more than 550mph (885kph) that put pressure on his body at five times the force of gravity. 
 It went nearly nose-to-nose with a second human-piloted F-16 as both aircraft raced within 1,000ft (305m) of each other, twisting and looping to try to force their opponent into vulnerable positions.
 At the end of the hourlong flight, Kendall climbed out of the cockpit, grinning. 
 He said he’d seen enough during his flight that he’d trust this still-learning AI with the ability to decide whether or not to launch weapons in war.
 There’s a lot of opposition to that idea. Arms control experts and humanitarian groups are deeply concerned that AI one day might be able to autonomously drop bombs that kill people without further human consultation, and they are seeking greater restrictions on its use.
 “There are widespread and serious concerns about ceding life-and-death decisions to sensors and software,” the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned. 
 Autonomous weapons “are an immediate cause of concern and demand an urgent, international political response”.
 Kendall said there will always be human oversight in the system when weapons are used.
 The military’s shift to AI-enabled planes is driven by security, cost and strategic capability. If the United States and China end up in conflict, for example, today’s US Air Force fleet of expensive, manned fighters will be vulnerable because of gains on both sides in electronic warfare, space and air defence systems. China’s air force is on pace to outnumber the US, and it is also amassing a fleet of flying unmanned weapons.
 Future war scenarios envision swarms of American unmanned aircraft providing an advance attack on enemy defences to give the US the ability to penetrate an airspace without high risk to pilot lives. But the shift is also driven by money. 
 The Air Force is still hampered by production delays and cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which will cost an estimated US$1.7 trillion (RM8.05 trillion).
 Smaller and cheaper AI-  controlled unmanned jets are the way ahead, Kendall said.
 Vista’s military operators say no other country in the world has an AI jet like it, where the software first learns from millions of data points in a simulator, then tests its conclusions during actual flights. 
 That real-world performance data is then put back into the simulator, where the AI processes it to learn more.
 China has AI, but there’s no indication it has found a way to run tests outside of a simulator. And, like a junior officer first learning tactics, some lessons can only be learned in the air, Vista’s test pilots said.
 Until you actually fly, “it’s all guesswork”, chief test pilot Bill Gray said. “And the longer it takes you to figure that out, the longer it takes before you have useful systems.”
 Vista flew its first AI-controlled dogfight in September 2023, and there have only been about two dozen similar flights since. But the programs are learning so quickly from each engagement that some AI versions getting tested on Vista are already beating human pilots in air-to-air combat.
 The pilots at this base are aware that, in some respects, they may be training their replacements or shaping a future construct where fewer of them are needed.
 But they also say they would not want to be up in the sky against an adversary with AI-controlled aircraft if the US does not also have its own fleet.
 “We have to keep running. And we have to run fast,” Kendall said. – AP",midday sun experimental orange white fighter jet familiar roar hallmark aerial combat artificial intelligence human pilot front seat air force secretary kendall mark biggest advance military aviation introduction stealth air force technology developed service planning fleet unmanned warplane dogfight edward air force base vast desert facility chuck yeager speed sound military secret aerospace advance classified simulator building layer surveillance test pilot generation training agent war kendall fly real time public statement confidence future role air combat security risk kendall interview permission witness secret flight condition complete operational security concern vista kendall lightning fast manoeuvre kph pressure body time gravity nose human aircraft force opponent vulnerable position hourlong flight kendall cockpit flight trust ability launch weapon war lot opposition idea arm control expert humanitarian concerned day bomb kill people human consultation restriction widespread concern life death decision sensor software international committee red cross autonomous weapon concern demand urgent international political response kendall human oversight system weapon military shift plane security cost strategic capability united china conflict air force fleet expensive fighter vulnerable gain electronic warfare space air defence system air force pace outnumber fleet unmanned weapon future war scenario envision swarm american advance attack enemy defence ability airspace risk pilot life money air force production delay overrun joint strike fighter cost cheaper unmanned jet vista military operator country jet software million data simulator test conclusion actual flight real performance data simulator learn china indication test junior officer tactic lesson air vista test pilot guesswork chief test pilot bill gray figure system vista flew dogfight september dozen flight program engagement version vista beating human pilot air air combat pilot base aware training replacement future construct fewer sky adversary aircraft fleet kendall,"[(1, 0.7011916), (2, 0.29598358)]",1
680451,Main,19,12/05/2024,AI not possible without the wealth of human knowledge,,"THERE is no artificial intelligence without the fruits of human inquiry.
 Today’s generative AI applications were built on a foundation of such information, drawn from across the internet and from various databases totalling, according to at least one estimate, somewhere around 300 billion words.
 That’s a lot of intellectual property, much of it produced by successive generations of professional writers, honed and polished by editors and sent out into the world by publishers in newspapers, magazines, books and more.
 It’s hard to put a price on such a thing or even to measure the collective value of such an incredible library. But it definitely should not be free.
 But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.
 If you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?
 That’s why many newspapers, including the Tribune, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.
 Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the internet and it’s technically possible to copy it. They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.
 There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.
 For decades, newspapers like this one have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed and followed fights over public works. In most every United States city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.
 The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.
 Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.
 AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.
 The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.
 OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognise the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was US$90bil (RM436.6bil).
 Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps – to develop the code, as it were – has value.
 That value must be recognised and these companies must be held accountable. — Chicago Tribune/TNS",artificial intelligence fruit human inquiry generative application foundation drawn internet lot intellectual property successive generation professional writer polished editor publisher newspaper magazine book hard price measure collective incredible library free assumption openai claim data acknowledges subject copyright fair compensation original creator owner stole book book crime newspaper tribune author digital publisher lawsuit force openai pay exploitation regular people copy seller studio stream competitor series internet copy license material owner buy copy copy purchaser reproduce redistribute fundamental issue ownership decade newspaper independent entity obituary local luminary crime committed fight public united city storehouse knowledge day day journalism create product supplant news publisher economy news time fair reporting critical weakening news publisher democracy siphon publisher revenue damage publisher reputation bogus credible publication hallucination app false response user question rise artificial intelligence inevitable originator expect adequate compensation primary backer microsoft pay engineer code recognise code valuation bil bil knowledge train apps code company accountable chicago tribune tn,"[(1, 0.36302194), (5, 0.6320234)]",5
680473,StarEdu,8,12/05/2024,"AI, the new character teacher",Onus on us to navigate tech that’s moulding young minds and morals,"As we sip our morning coffee, virtual assistants like Alexa brief us on the day’s schedule.
 This mundane routine masks a profound revolution unfolding right in our homes – the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. AI isn’t only changing how we live; it’s also redefining the way our children learn, think and develop character.
 Consider this astonishing fact: AI can predict your child’s learning difficulties even before they manifest in the classroom. 
 Researchers have developed algorithms that analyse children’s interactions with educational apps, flagging potential learning disabilities like dyslexia or adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) long before traditional methods. 
 This early intervention is a game changer, offering a future where no child slips through the educational cracks.
 Furthermore, AI-driven data analytics are enhancing the ability of educators to understand the diverse needs of students. By examining patterns in large sets of educational data, AI can provide insights into the effectiveness of teaching methods and curricula, leading to more informed decisions that can tailor educational content to the needs of individual learners.
 But AI’s educational prowess doesn’t stop at early detection. It’s reshaping our educational paradigms. In Sweden, an AI-powered language learning app called “Elevate” has made headlines for its ability to adapt to each student’s learning style, pacing and retention capacity, resulting in a 30% faster learning rate compared with traditional methods. 
 Imagine a classroom where each child’s unique learning curve is not only recognised but embraced and catered to. That’s the future AI is building.
 AI is also transforming the way homework is assigned and completed. With smart algorithms, homework can now be customised to challenge students at the right level, promote better understanding, and provide immediate feed­back to keep them motivated. This ensures that students are neither bored with tasks that are too easy nor discouraged by those that are too difficult.
 Now, let’s venture into the realm of the extraordinary. In Japan, elementary schools are using AI robots to teach not only language and maths, but also empathy and social skills. 
 These robots, equipped with emotional intelligence algorithms, interact with students, teaching them to recognise and respond to emotional cues. Examples of these robots are RoBoHon and Musio X. 
 In a world where digital fluency is as crucial as literacy, these AI companions are preparing our children for a future where humans and machines coexist.
 Yet, AI’s impact transcends the classroom walls. It’s in our living rooms, shaping family dynamics. An intriguing example is the AI-powered family gaming platforms that are revolutionising how families spend time together such as Minecraft: Education Edition and Kidgeni. These platforms use AI to create interactive, educational games that adapt to the family’s interests, making learning a fun and engaging activity that bonds rather than isolates.
 The “wow” factor of AI in education also lies in its subtlety. It’s in the AI-curated YouTube playlists that subtly influence your child’s cognitive development, in the smart toys that teach problem-solving, and even in the virtual reality field trips that bring historical events to life.
 These experiences are not only educational; they’re also character-building, instilling a sense of curiosity, critical thinking and a global perspective.
 Furthermore, AI is facilitating a new era of personalised learning paths. Adaptive learning systems can now curate and recommend resources from across the web to supplement a child’s educa­tion, ensuring they receive a well-rounded and expansive learning experience that is not confined by the resources of their local environment.
 However, with these advancements come responsibilities. The ethical implications of AI in our children’s lives are profound. From privacy concerns to the need for human oversight in AI education, the path forward is a delicate balance between embracing AI’s potential and safeguarding our children’s futures.
 We must also consider the socio-economic implications as AI becomes more pervasive in education. Ensuring equitable access to these advanced technologies is critical to avoid widening the educational divide. Initiatives to bridge the digital gap and bring AI tools to underserved communities are vital to ensuring that the benefits of AI in education are available to all.
 Indeed, the AI revolution in our homes is more than a technological wave; it’s a transformative force shaping the minds and morals of our future generations. As educators, parents and guardians of this new digital frontier, it’s our task to navigate this revolution thoughtfully. 
 The future is not only about humans teaching machines; it’s also about what machines will teach our children and us. We stand on the brink of an era where AI not only augments education, but also becomes a cornerstone of it.

680503,Lifestyle,7,12/05/2024,Using AI to translate manga,,"A JAPANESE startup announced recently it aims to use artificial intelligence to help translate manga comics into English five times faster and 90% cheaper than at present.
 Manga titles such as One Piece and Dragon Ball are a huge success story for Japan, with the market projected to be worth US$42.2bil (approximately RM200bil) by 2030, according to the startup, Orange Inc.
 But it said only about two percent of Japan’s annual output of 700,000 manga volumes are released in English, “partly due to the difficult and lengthy translation process and the limited number of translators”.
 But with its technology, Orange aims to produce 500 English-language mangas per month, five times more than the industry’s current capacity, and 50,000 volumes in five years. Other languages will come later.
 Overcoming manga slang
 “Compared to translation of a book, translating Japanese used in manga, which uses very short sentences of conversational language often full of slang, is extremely difficult,” said Orange’s marketing vice-president Tatsuhiro Sato.
 “It is also difficult to figure out if the particular quote was actually said at a scene, or the line was a murmur inside one’s heart describing a mental landscape,” Sato told AFP.
 Other challenges include the original text often being written vertically and finding equivalents for Japan’s many words to convey noises.
 The firm announced that it had raised 2.92 billion yen (US$19mil, RM90mil) in funding from major publisher Shogakukan and nine venture capital groups including the government-backed JIC Venture Growth Investments.

 The Prime Minister made the promise after a question from a student representative about having access to advanced computer facilities via a centralised cloud computing.
 “This is about synergy, cloud computing at the moment has limited access, but our policy is that we want to accelerate (access to information).
 “We will ask the Digital Ministry, Communications Ministry and the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry to coordinate this in a simpler format.
 “Give us two weeks. All the research bodies in the inter-ministry have to be ready in terms of access for all the universities,” he said at the launch of the Malaysia Artificial Intelligence Nexus-Boosting the Future at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
 Also present were Comm­unications Minister Fahmi Fadzil, Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo, Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang and Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Mustapha Sakmud.
 Anwar said the government had synchronised all scientific institutions with universities, which had been working in silos and had untapped research. 
 Mandatory identification of departments and professors in complementing research fields was enforced last year. 
 He then went on to point out the need for synergy cuts across many aspects, including the Prime Minister’s Office, Cybersecurity Malaysia and Defence Ministry.
 He added that it was important to anticipate threats from outside, which meant strengthening cybersecurity in terms of AI.
 Earlier, in his speech, he called for the acceleration of efforts to push the pace of AI development in the country.
 He said the governance of the AI ecosystem needed to be systematic, with professional and skilled talent who can work with multinational corporations and the Malaysian Artificial Intelligence Consortium (MAIC).
 He said there had to be emphasis on mathematics and science at universities, and they had to be made more appealing as there was a lack of interest in these subjects among the younger generation.
 He also said there was a weakness in terms of specialisation, especially with a shortage of 30,000 engineers.
 “We cannot use old approaches. If we want more engineers, then a quicker approach is needed to produce them. Changes must be made swiftly and properly,” he said.
 Anwar presented an appointment letter to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for the setting up of the MAIC.

679379,StarBiz,8,09/05/2024,Regulatory oversight on artificial intelligence vital,Upholding ESG pillars in cybersecurity key to growth,"PETALING JAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) in the telecommunications (telecoms)space is in need of regulatory oversight to ensure that environmental, social and governance (ESG) pillars in cybersecurity are upheld, say analysts.
 Having attended the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s International Regulatory Conference 2024, Kenanga Research said the development of AI governance policies is essential to inspire trust and displace suspicion surrounding AI.
 “Legislation and guidelines should be in place to counter cybersecurity threats to the telecoms industry and its users arising from AI. 
 “This includes the perpetration of online scams, proliferation of deep fakes and phishing,” it said in a report yesterday.
 Kenanga Research noted that at this early juncture, only the European Union has implemented broad-based acts to regulate AI.
 For other countries, to kickstart the journey of regulating AI, Kenanga Research said Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (Imda) believes that AI providers should be transparent and forthcoming in their disclosures to highlight any risks presented by AI. 
 “Hence, this would result in better understanding and thus enable organisations and regulators to work towards risk-management measures in mitigating AI threats,” said the research house.
 Imda is a statutory board under the Singapore Communications and Information Ministry.
 Additionally, Kenanga Research said organisations and digital citizens should leverage AI as an effective tool to enhance cybersecurity. 
 “In other words, this involves using AI to fight AI,” it said.
 Separately, Kenanga Research highlighted the sustained traction in the Global System for Mobile Communications Association’s (GSMA) efforts to develop a globally harmonised framework of principles and standards, which will result in the sustainable and ethical use of AI. 
 “The GSMA’s principles-based ethics framework applies a balanced approach, where it acts as a guide to ensure that AI operates within its boundaries, without restricting its normal course of development.”
 Citing local mobile network operator YTL Communications Sdn Bhd as an example, Kenanga Research said the group is playing its part in shaping the future of AI in Malaysia via its upcoming YTL AI Cloud service. 
 “It will be powered by the Nvidia Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud to accelerate the development of generative AI.
 “Its AI compute power will surpass more than 300 exaflops, rendering it as one of the fastest supercomputers in the world,” said Kenanga Research, which is maintaining an “overweight” call on the telecoms sector.
 “We believe that investors are less cautious on 5G as monetisation opportunities emerge from selling managed solutions and cloud offerings to enterprise clients in the immediate term. 
 “Furthermore, as adoption of generative AI cloud solutions gains momentum, this could emerge as an earnings growth driver for mobile operators over the longer term.”
 On top of that, the research house said the looming announcement of the official 5G dual network policy directive would finally resolve uncertainty that has weighed on sector sentiment. 
 “We maintain our ‘overweight’ recommendation on the sector, with our top picks being Telekom Malaysia Bhd and CelcomDigi Bhd.”",jaya artificial intelligence telecommunication telecom space regulatory oversight environmental social governance esg pillar cybersecurity upheld analyst malaysian communication commission international regulatory conference kenanga development governance policy inspire trust displace suspicion legislation guideline cybersecurity threat industry user perpetration online scam proliferation deep fake report yesterday juncture european union broad act country journey regulating kenanga singapore infocomm medium development authority provider transparent forthcoming disclosure risk result enable organisation regulator management measure threat house statutory board singapore communication kenanga organisation digital citizen leverage effective tool enhance cybersecurity fight sustained traction global system mobile communication association gsma effort framework principle standard sustainable ethical gsma principle ethic framework applies approach act guide operates boundary normal development local mobile network operator ytl communication bhd kenanga future malaysia ytl cloud service nvidia grace blackwell dgx cloud accelerate development generative compute power surpass fastest supercomputer overweight call telecom sector investor cautious monetisation opportunity solution offering client term adoption generative cloud solution gain momentum emerge earnings growth mobile operator term top house announcement official dual network policy directive uncertainty sector sentiment maintain overweight recommendation sector top pick malaysia bhd celcomdigi bhd,"[(2, 0.99499494)]",2
679393,StarBiz,11,09/05/2024,AI boom set to fuel  data centre deals in Asia,Region accounts for more than half of global M&A in 2024,"SINGAPORE: Global private equity investors and asset managers are readying for billions of US dollars worth of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and investments linked to data centres in Asia Pacific, as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fuels demand for digital infrastructure.
 The intense pace of deals in the world’s most populous region comes as countries and companies respond to booming demand for AI, calling for more data capacity, industry executives said.
 Asia Pacific, including Japan, has led dealmaking activities in the global data centre market this year, with M&A value totalling US$840.47mil, more than half of the global amount, LSEG data showed.
 In 2023, the region’s data centre deals hit a record high of US$3.45bil, according to LSEG. That tally is set to be surpassed this year with at least a couple of large transactions in the pipeline.
 A number of financial sponsors, including global investment powerhouse Blackstone Inc, are looking to acquire AirTrunk, which owns 11 hyperscale data centres in Australia and the rest of the region, sources close to the transaction said.
 AirTrunk owners, Macquarie Group and Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), are aiming to value the business at up to A$15bil or US$9.8bil, sources said, in what could be Asia’s largest data centre transaction this year.
 AirTrunk, Blackstone, Macquarie and PSP declined to comment.
 “The AI revolution is creating an unprecedented wall of demand for high-quality data-centre capacity,” said Garren Cronin, managing director of Cadence Advisory, which advised on Australian data centre operator NEXTDC’s US$861mil capital raising in April.
 “The new capacity that needs to be built in Asia Pacific in the next three to five years is simply mind blowing. My expectation is that deal flow in the data centre space will intensify in 2024.”
 Microsoft Corp last week said it would invest US$2.2bil over the next four years in Malaysia to expand its cloud and AI services across Asia.
 The rise of data centre investments in Asia follows a similar trajectory to that seen in the United States and Europe with technology giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc and Meta Platforms rapidly expanding their AI capabilities.
 Microsoft will open its first Asian data centre in Thailand, the company said last Wednesday, a day after announcing US$1.7bil worth of investments in AI and cloud facilities in neighbouring Indonesia.
 Other potential deals in Asia include Indonesia’s state-owned Telkom Indonesia’s sale of a stake in its data centre business worth US$1bil and Japan’s NEC weighing a US$500mil data centre sale, according to news reports.
 Telkom senior vice-president of investor relations Ahmad Reza told Reuters yesterday that Telkom is open to strategic partnerships to bring its data centre business arm NeutraDC new capabilities and new markets.
 “We have explored several potential partners, but we are still evaluating for the best one,” he said. “We expect to finish this process by the end of this year.”
 NEC said it was not able to comment on market speculation.
 US investment firm Bain Capital is seeking credit financing for the international assets of data centre operator Chindata and investments for its China business, people close to Bain Capital said.
 Bain, which took Chindata private from the Hong Kong bourse last year in a US$3.16bil deal, declined to comment.
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), which invested in AirTrunk in 2017 before selling its stake to a Macquarie-led consortium three years later, has deployed more than US$1bil on data centre development in Asia over the past three years.
 The firm would actively invest in additional projects, with a particular focus on Japan and South Korea, said Nikhil Reddy, head of Asia Pacific real estate at GSAM.
 “AI creates a different type of need for data centres beyond the historic demands of the cloud focused on low latency. Now with AI, which entails massive data consumption, capacity is key,” he said. — Reuters",global private equity investor asset manager billion dollar worth merger acquisition investment data centre pacific artificial intelligence boom fuel digital infrastructure intense pace deal populous region country company booming demand data capacity industry executive pacific japan dealmaking activity global data centre market mil half global amount lseg data region data centre deal record bil surpassed couple transaction pipeline financial sponsor global investment powerhouse blackstone airtrunk hyperscale data centre rest region source close transaction airtrunk owner canada public sector pension investment board business bil bil source largest data centre transaction blackstone macquarie psp comment revolution unprecedented wall demand quality data capacity garren cronin director cadence advisory australian data centre operator nextdc mil capital april capacity pacific expectation deal flow data space intensify microsoft corp week bil malaysia cloud service rise data centre investment asia trajectory europe technology giant amazon microsoft alphabet meta platform capability asian data centre thailand company wednesday day bil worth investment cloud facility indonesia potential deal indonesia telkom indonesia sale stake data centre business worth bil japan mil data sale news report senior vice president investor relation reza reuters yesterday strategic partnership data centre business arm neutradc capability market potential partner finish process nec comment market speculation investment firm capital credit international asset centre operator chindata investment business people capital bain chindata private hong kong bourse bil deal comment goldman asset management gsam airtrunk stake macquarie consortium data centre development asia firm invest additional project japan korea nikhil reddy head pacific real estate gsam type data centre historic demand low latency massive data consumption capacity key reuters,"[(0, 0.996474)]",0
679425,StarBiz,16,09/05/2024,DeepMind alumni raise US$200mil funding round for Holistic AI,,"PARIS: Holistic AI, a new startup in Paris working to leapfrog other generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, has closed the first tranche of a US$200mil initial financing round, according to people familiar with the deal.
 Investors agreed to put in US$80mil in equity and US$120mil in convertible debt, chiefly for buying computing power, said the people who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t yet public.
 They said the founding round valued the company at US$370mil.
 The startup, formed by a group of scientists who recently left DeepMind, Google’s artificial intelligence lab, has audacious aims.
 It’s working to develop “multi-agent” models, a process where a number of AI systems interact with one another.
 The deal for the months-old startup marks continued intense interest in companies pushing forward in AI, with investors willing to take a bet on founding teams based on their employment history as much as their proposed product.
 In an investor presentation, the startup described its goal to develop AI with skills like memory, planning, and “tactical decision-making” that AI systems have struggled with.
 “We build genuine AGI capabilities,” read the presentation, referencing theoretical AI systems that outperform humans on all tasks.
 Holistic’s chief executive officer Charles Kantor did not respond to a request for comment.
 Charles Kantor is a former venture resident at Stanford University’s business school. The other four members of the founding team are engineers who spent years at DeepMind working on some of its advanced models.
 Venture firm Accel Partners LP is participating in the round, the people said.
 Other investors include Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive officer. 
 Business Insider previously reported some of the details of the funding round.
 Accel, a fund based in California, was an early backer of Facebook, Dropbox and several other prominent Internet companies.
 But the firm has steered clear of startups building foundational AI models, such as OpenAI and Mistral, another Parisian newcomer that raced to a US$2bil-plus valuation in its first year.
 In its investor document, Holistic AI pitched a vision of moving “beyond” large language models like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini.
 The document said the startup was planning to target “multiple verticals” and revenue streams.
 “We are raising a large round to train the model and start going after these markets,” the presentation read. — Bloomberg",paris holistic startup paris leapfrog generative artificial intelligence model tranche mil initial financing round people familiar deal investor mil equity mil convertible debt chiefly power people detail public round company startup formed scientist google artificial intelligence lab audacious aim multi agent model process system interact deal month startup mark intense company investor team employment history product investor presentation startup goal skill memory tactical decision system build genuine agi capability presentation theoretical system human task holistic chief executive officer charles respond request comment charles venture resident stanford university business school team engineer advanced model venture firm partner round people investor eric schmidt google chief executive officer business insider detail round accel fund california backer facebook dropbox prominent internet company firm startup foundational model mistral parisian newcomer bil valuation investor document holistic vision language model gpt google gemini document startup target multiple vertical revenue stream round train model start market bloomberg,"[(1, 0.6470029), (3, 0.34794247)]",1

679067,StarBiz,12,08/05/2024,"Microsoft readies new AI model to compete with Google, OpenAI",,"NEW YORK: Microsoft is training a new, in-house artificial intelligence (AI) language model large enough to compete with those from Alphabet’s Google and OpenAI, The Information reports.
 The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the Google DeepMind co-founder and former CEO of AI startup Inflection, the report said, citing two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort.The exact purpose of the model has not been determined yet and will depend on how well it performs. Microsoft could preview the new model as soon as its Build developer conference later this month, the report said. Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
 MAI-1 will be “far larger” than the previous smaller, open source models Microsoft had previously trained which means it will be more expensive, according to the report.
 Microsoft last month launched a smaller AI model called Phi-3-mini as it looks to attract a wider client base with cost-effective options.
 The company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and deployed the ChatGPT maker’s technology across its suite of productivity software, allowing it to take an early lead in the generative AI race.
 Microsoft has been setting aside large cluster of servers equipped with Nvidia’s graphic processing units along with large amounts of data to improve the model, according to the report.
 MAI-1 will have roughly 500 billion parameters, the report said, while OpenAI’s GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters and Phi-3 mini measures 3.8 billion parameters.
 Microsoft tapped Suleyman in March as the head of its newly created consumer AI unit and hired several employees of Inflection.

679199,Main,18,08/05/2024,AI translation to get more eyes on more manga,,"A Japanese startup said it aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help translate manga comics into English five times faster and 90% cheaper than at present.
 Manga such as One Piece and Dragon Ball are a huge success story for Japan, with the market projected to be worth US$42.2bil by 2030, according to the startup, Orange Inc.
 But it said only about 2% of Japan’s annual output of 700,000 manga volumes are released in English, “partly due to the difficult and lengthy translation process and the limited number of translators”.
 But with its technology, Orange aims to produce 500 English-language manga per month, five times more than the industry’s current capacity, and 50,000 volumes in five years. Other languages will come later.
 “Compared to translation of a book, translating Japanese used in manga, which uses very short sentences of conversational language often full of slang, is extremely difficult,” said Orange’s marketing vice-president Tatsu­hiro Sato said yesterday.
 “It is also difficult to figure out if the particular quote was actually said ... or the line was a murmur inside one’s heart describing a mental landscape,” Sato said.
 Other challenges include the original text often being written vertically and finding equivalents for Japan’s many words to convey noises.
 The firm announced that it had raised ¥2.92bil (RM89.9mil) in funding from major publisher Shogakukan and nine venture capital groups including the government-backed JIC Venture Growth Investments.

678693,Main,14,07/05/2024,AI search engine making Parliament debates accessible,,"AN artificial intelligence (AI)-powered search engine has been launched that makes combing through decades of parliamentary records more fruitful  for the public, and which could raise understanding of how  issues evolve in Singapore’s top law-making body.
 Called Pair Search, the website search.pair.gov.sg is powered by a large language model (LLM) – the same technology behind ChatGPT – and also lets users sift through case judgments from the High Court and Court of Appeal.
 Early results from test users of the prototype search engine have been encouraging, said Open Government Products (OGP) senior software engineer Oh Chin Yang.
 OGP is an experimental development arm of the Government that builds technology for the public. The search engine project was conceived at its annual hackathon, as the team felt recent strides in natural language processing and information retrieval could make for a more effective search tool for both public officers and citizens, said Oh.
 “The best public policy decision and debate is an informed one, and that starts with search,” he said.
 Based on data since it was soft-launched at the start of 2024, 84%  of all users who clicked on at least one search result found their searches within the first 10 results shown to them, said Oh, who is one of six members of the Pair product team.
 As at April, there have been approximately 2,700 users on Pair Search for parliamentary records, with a combined total of 8,300 search queries, he added.
 While there is an existing search platform for Hansard – the official record of debates in Parliament – it is “difficult and unintuitive” to use, said the Pair Search team on the OGP hackathon’s website.
 Results were poor as the existing search engine is fully keyword-based, which meant that debates in the House that frequently mentioned a single word in a query were often ranked more highly than more relevant results, it added.
 For instance, it was found that searching for the keywords “Covid-19 rapid testing” using the Hansard search engine led to eight irrelevant documents among the top results.
 All of the top 10 results generated by Pair Search were relevant to the query.
 The higher hit rate is due to Pair Search’s use of a combination of advanced keyword matching and contextual search that understands a user’s intent. This means it can even generate relevant results when there are no matching keywords, said the team. — The Straits Times/ANN",artificial intelligence search engine decade parliamentary record fruitful public raise issue top law body pair search website search pair gov language model llm technology chatgpt user judgment court court appeal test user search engine encouraging government product senior software engineer chin yang experimental development arm government build technology public search engine project annual hackathon team natural language processing retrieval effective search tool public officer citizen public policy decision debate search data soft start user search result search product team april user search parliamentary record total search query search platform hansard official record parliament difficult unintuitive pair search team ogp hackathon website poor search engine keyword meant debate house single word query relevant instance keywords covid rapid hansard search engine irrelevant document top top pair search relevant query hit rate pair search combination keyword contextual search user intent generate relevant matching keywords team time,"[(2, 0.4008639), (5, 0.5938242)]",5

677481,Main,16,04/05/2024,Digital citizenship in the age of artificial intelligence,,"I REFER to the report “AI basics to be taught at primary schools in 2027” (The Star, March 26). This is indeed the way forward in creating a digital savvy generation.
 Digital literacy is crucial today and in the future to ensure that Malaysia is able to develop local experts in AI, virtual reality, machine learning, prompt engineering and other advanced technologies.
 In the midst of all these exciting developments, one pressing issue that demands our attention is the integrity that needs to be nurtured among those who are using such technologies.
 When the Internet was first introduced in this country, it was embraced by people from all walks of life without much hesitation, giving birth to a thriving digital society.
 Those born in the digital age are called “digital natives” while the others who did not grow up using digital technology are called “digital immigrants”. 
 Both types of digital users have grown by leaps and bounds as the Internet and social media platforms continue to thrive.
 Unfortunately, no one is fully exposed to knowledge in digital citizenship – the responsible use of technology by anyone who uses computers, the Internet, and digital devices to engage with the society on any level. 
 Integrating basic AI must come with the internalisation of good values, such as the use of appropriate language and behaviour when interacting with others to avoid cyberbullying. 
 Primary school students must also be taught to respect the opinions and ideas of others.
 Moreover, they must be exposed to basic intellectual property laws as a measure to discourage plagiarism.
 While developing their skills in AI, students must understand that they cannot use and share other people’s work without permission and, most importantly, they ought to follow the rules and regulations set by every Internet site.
 Without adequate exposure to such codes, technological abuse, particularly through various use of AI such as deepfake, creation of inappropriate sexual materials and blatant plagiarism would be rampant.
 Technological education, undeniably, is a field of study that must be part of the younger generation’s learning process, but it must come with integration of values so that we are not developing the ground for a dystopian society to grow.ZARLINA MOHD ZAMARI

676747,StarBiz,14,02/05/2024,Rising AI demand spurs  Amazon cloud unit sales,Businesses resume spending on technology projects,"WASHINGTON: Amazon.com Inc’s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer’s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence (AI) services.
 Despite the strong cloud performance, the company’s sales forecast for the current quarter fell short of estimates, reflecting concern about the main eCommerce business as consumers continue to spend cautiously.
 In recent years, chief executive officer Andy Jassy has cut costs and focused on profitability in Amazon’s online shopping business, laying off thousands of people and touting a more efficient warehouse network. 
 At the same time, he’s backed big investments in AI services that Amazon expects to generate tens of billions in revenue in the coming years. Those sales are starting to materialise.
 The Seattle-based company posted a first quarter operating profit of US$15.3bil.
 Revenue increased 13% to US$143.3bil in the period ended March 31, Amazon said in a statement. Both figures topped analysts’ estimates.
 Sales in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit were US$25bil, up 17% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated AWS sales at US$24.1bil.
 “We’re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,” chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. “They’re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.” 
 Olsavsky said generative AI now represented a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business” for Amazon, the first time the company has publicly put even an approximate figure on that franchise.
 That will come at a cost. AI chatbots, data-crunching tools, and other software that respond to queries from users are possible only thanks to massive quantities of cutting-edge computer chips. 
 Olsavsky said Amazon’s capital expenditures would “meaningfully increase” in 2024, primarily to support AWS growth, including for generative AI. 
 The company has said it will spend more than US$150bil to build out and operate data centres in the coming years.
 Sales growth at the cloud unit had slowed to a record low last year as businesses cut back on technology spending and sought to curb computing bills that ballooned during the pandemic. 
 Investors have been banking on a rebound this year, particularly after strong results last week from Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon’s two main rivals in the business of renting computing power and data storage.
 AWS generated a profit of US$9.42bil in the quarter.
 The unit’s operating margin, which is 37.6%, is the widest since Amazon began disclosing sales for its cloud business. The division held its largest-ever layoffs last year and has continued to trim its ranks selectively, even as it hires in other areas.
 Amazon said revenue will range from US$144bil to US$149bil in the period ending in June. Analysts, on average, projected US$150.2bil. The company’s main eCommerce business reported sales of US$54.6bil in the quarter, slightly missing analysts’ estimates.
 Olsavsky said consumers continue to trade down to save money.
 Shoppers are ordering more consumables, which they need quickly, but they also cost less than other categories, he said.
 That puts pressure on the profitability of the business because Amazon has to process and deliver more units.
 The slowing eCommerce sales have also pushed Amazon to seek greater growth for other business lines. For example, advertising revenue rose 24% to US$11.8bil.
 The results reflect the first quarter since Amazon introduced video advertising to the Prime Video streaming service.
 Amazon shares gained about 2% in extended trading after closing at US$175 in New York.

676767,StarBiz,16,02/05/2024,AMD slides on muted forecast for AI processors,Firm projects MI300 lineup to generate lower sales,"NEW YORK: Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares declined as much as 9.1% in extended trading after the chipmaker gave a disappointing forecast for artificial intelligence (AI) processors, a lucrative market now dominated by Nvidia Corp.
 The company projected that its MI300 lineup, a family of so-called AI accelerators, would generate about US$4bil in revenue this year. Though that’s up from an earlier prediction of US$3.5bil, some investors were hoping for as much as US$8bil, according to analysts.
 AMD is seen as a leading contender to challenge Nvidia in the market for accelerators, which help develop chatbots and other tools by bombarding them with data. 
 But it’s playing catch-up in the industry. One challenge has been making enough of the chips to meet demand, chief executive officer Lisa Su said. 
 “We are tight on supply,” she said. “There’s no question that, in the near term, if we had more supply, we have demand.”
 AMD also gave a tepid revenue forecast for the current quarter. Sales will be approximately US$5.7bil in the period, the Santa Clara, California-based firm said. 
 That compares with an average analyst estimate of US$5.72bil. Weak demand for chips used in video game hardware has hampered growth. 
 The shares fell as low as US$143.90 in late trading after the results were released. They had closed at $158.38 on Tuesday, up 7.4% for the year. 
 The AMD report follows a downbeat forecast last week from Intel Corp, which said it expects demand to remain sluggish in the first half of the year. 
 AMD is expecting growth in the range of 6% in the current quarter, better than the roughly flat projection of its larger rival.
 Though Intel is still bigger than AMD in overall sales, it only expects to get about US$500mil in revenue from AI accelerators this year. 
 Nvidia remains far ahead of both companies. Its data centre business is on course to chalk up revenue of US$95.9bil in its current financial year, up two-fold from a year earlier and higher than the total revenue of Intel and AMD combined.
 Su said that the supply constraints with its MI300 line should ease later this year, but they are having an impact in the second quarter. 
 In the first quarter, AMD had earnings of 62 US cents a share, excluding some items, and revenue of US$5.47bil. That performance compared with an estimated 61 US cents in profit and US$5.45bil in sales.
 AMD’s PC chip division had revenue of about US$1.4bil, compared with a US$1.29bil estimate. 
 Data centre sales came in at US$2.3bil, in line with the average projection. Gaming computer-related revenue, meanwhile, was US$922mil. Analysts had expected sales of US$965.5mil.
 Like Intel, AMD still gets most of its revenue from personal computer and server microprocessors. 
 The once-solid server market has been less reliable recently because data centre operators have plowed much of their budgets into Nvidia chips – the very area AMD is now making its own play for.
 Investors betting on AMD’s AI prospects had set off a rally earlier this year, though the stock cooled in recent months. The announcement of a next-generation Nvidia chip has weighed on the shares.
 AMD also competes with Nvidia in the market for graphics processors that improve the images in video games. 
 It’s the biggest rival of Intel in both server and PC processors, as well as in programmable logic chips, which can be reconfigured with software after they’re installed. 
 And it supplies Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp with the main component in their game consoles.
 AMD said that its gross margin – the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production – will be about 53% in the second quarter, matching predictions. — Bloomberg",york micro device amd share extended trading chipmaker forecast artificial intelligence processor market corp company lineup family accelerator bil revenue prediction investor bil analyst contender challenge nvidia market accelerator chatbots tool data catch industry chip demand chief executive officer tight supply question term supply demand tepid revenue current quarter sale period santa clara california firm average analyst estimate bil weak demand chip game hardware growth share low trading tuesday amd report downbeat week intel corp demand sluggish half amd growth range current quarter flat projection larger rival intel bigger amd sale mil revenue accelerator company centre business chalk revenue current financial fold total revenue intel amd supply constraint ease impact quarter quarter amd earnings cent share item revenue performance estimated cent profit bil sale chip division revenue bil bil estimate data centre sale average projection computer revenue mil analyst sale intel amd revenue personal computer server microprocessor server market reliable data centre operator budget nvidia chip play investor amd prospect earlier stock month announcement generation chip share competes market graphic processor image game biggest rival intel server processor programmable logic chip software installed supply corp sony corp main component game gross margin percentage sale cost production quarter prediction,"[(0, 0.9952776)]",0
676437,Main,3,01/05/2024,"Youth: Bring on the AI, if it helps us improve our work",,"PETALING JAYA: Most young people do not think that generative artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics would be threats to their jobs in the future, but view such technologies as tools that can help them improve their work.
 Student S. Karelene, 25, said she is quite confident about her job security because being an early childhood educator requires high levels of human interaction, emotional intelligence and creativity.
 “These are not easily (replica­ted) by AI and robotics. I do believe AI may be of assistance in improving processes and conduct, but it would not be much of a threat to my position,” she said in an interview.
 To be a professional and successful educator, especially in early childhood education, the essential elements are patience, strategy and prioritising, she added.“I am keeping myself informed on the latest development in methods to manage students from that age group.
 “Currently, I am juggling work and studies, and I think it helps since I am able to test and apply what I learn in the university on my students. I believe the learning never ends and I plan to keep my mind open to new information and methods.
 “By 2040, I see myself as a successful proprietor of an early childhood centre, preferably one that is specialised in special education. I would like to think that I will also be active in making education a bit more accessible to children in rural areas,” Karelene said.
 A social impact expert, who wanted to be known only as Kamalina, 28, is positive about her job prospects amid the industry shift towards AI integration.
 “Work is changing for sure, yet it still relies on that essential human touch. There’s talk about AI and robots which may affect certain roles differently across industries.
 “In my opinion, they can catalyse job enhancements rather than be replacements. While AI boosts efficiency and productivity, our human oversight is crucial.
 “Some roles may evolve and be more susceptible to automation, and this transformation also brings forth fresh opportunities for growth and innovation,” she said.
 To stay ahead, Kamalina is keen to learn and adapt.
 “It’s a fast-moving world and keeping up keeps us in the game.
 “Overall, I’m feeling pretty good about where we’re headed. What is important is to keep embracing change, recognising that our human skills will always be our strongest asset,” she said.
 Kamalina said she is focused on developing a mix of technical and soft skills.
 “As for technical skills, it is to gain skills in data analysis tools and proficiency in software platforms. I also keep myself updated with digital literacy and technology trends linked to my side role in creative work,” she said.

676529,Main,10,01/05/2024,AI luggage scanners to help fight smuggling,,"PUTRAJAYA: Smuggling will become even harder once artificial intelligence-enabled luggage scanners are placed at all entry points into the country.
 At least 40 of these AI-enabled scanner units will be placed at strategic locations in several states to help detect and prevent smuggling. 
 Customs Department assistant director-general (enforcement) Ribuan Abdullah (pic) said these scanners would be placed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as well as in Perlis, Kedah, Perak, Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak.
 He explained that the AI technology would assist his personnel in analysing images taken during the scanning process which could help in detecting smuggled items.
 He said the department began using scanners which were equipped with AI at the end of last year at KLIA.
 “These scanners have shown good results and we have made several arrests and seizures, especially on drug smuggling attempts, at KLIA because of it,” he told reporters at the Customs Department headquarters here yesterday.
 He said these scanners were capable of analysing images and colours more clearly.
 “We are also looking at acquiring more cargo scanners which are equipped with drive through multi-view dual energy systems.
 “These high-powered scanners which will be placed at our country’s entry and exit points, like Port Klang, will also help us curb smuggling of drugs and other illicit items,” he said, adding that as of April this year, his department had seized a total of 585.72kg of drugs detected with scanners.
 Ribuan said the department would also be acquiring 20 more drug detecting dogs in June to add to the 20 already being used.
 “In the first quarter of this year, we have detected 1,856 attempted smuggling and evasion of Customs duties with the seizure of RM350.18mil worth of drugs, cigarettes, vehicles, alcohol, textiles and other commodities.
 “We recorded a 181.72% increase in seizures during this quarter when compared to the RM124.3mil of seizures made during the same period last year,” he said, adding that they seized 385 vehicles worth RM27.55mil.
 He said that the vehicles that were seized were mostly luxury vehicles such as Toyata Vellfires, Toyota Alphards and various Mercedes Benz models.
 “Surprisingly, now that the Yamaha RX-Z motorcycle has gained more popularity, we are seeing more of these bikes being seized as they are brought over illegally from neighbouring countries without permits.
 “We believe these motorcycles are brought in either by boat via Sungai Golok or through lorries,” he said, adding that the cases involving smuggling these motorcycles increased when the market value for these motorcycles went up to about RM15,000 for a used one.
 Ribuan said they also opened 711 cases involving the smuggling of 125 million contraband cigarettes worth over RM104.31mil.
 “We also seized 847.41kg of drugs worth RM29.56mil and 2.81million litres of alcohol worth RM41.7mil,” he said, adding that they also seized RM3.85mil worth of textiles.",putrajaya artificial intelligence luggage scanner country scanner unit strategic location prevent custom department assistant director enforcement ribuan abdullah pic scanner lumpur international airport klia kedah perak penang johor sabah sarawak technology assist personnel image process item department scanner klia scanner arrest seizure drug attempt told reporter department headquarters yesterday scanner capable image cargo scanner drive multi view dual energy system scanner country entry exit port curb smuggling drug illicit item april department total drug scanner ribuan department drug dog june add quarter attempted smuggling evasion custom duty mil worth drug vehicle alcohol textile commodity increase seizure quarter mil seizure period seized vehicle worth mil vehicle luxury vehicle vellfires toyota alphards mercedes model motorcycle popularity bike neighbouring country motorcycle boat sungai golok lorry motorcycle market motorcycle ribuan contraband cigarette worth mil drug worth mil litre worth mil mil worth textile,"[(4, 0.9933872)]",4
676597,Main,19,01/05/2024,Using AI to beat homelessness,,"LAST June, Breanna Sanchez was in trouble: she was behind on the rent, and her landlord in Los Angeles was threatening her family with eviction. But then she was thrown a lifeline, helped by an invisible algorithm.
 Sanchez’s precarious situation had been detected by an artificial intelligence (AI) tool being used as part of an innovative experiment by Los Angeles County to identify residents at risk of losing their homes within 12 months.
 The tool analyses more than 400 factors – including data from the county jail and hospitals, safety net programmes, and homelessness and foster care systems – to create a list of 100,000 people deemed at risk of ending up on the streets.
 Then city officials get to work to deliver counsel and even cash, hoping to stop more from ending up as statistics in a growing nationwide homelessness crisis.
 Sanchez got a letter urging her to contact a county department for housing help. Soon the 33-year-old was talking to an outreach worker, getting signed up for health and other programmes and receiving financial assistance that helped her pay her rent, fix her car and more.
 “I probably would have been evicted,” said Sanchez. “Me and my husband felt stuck and didn’t know how to move forward.”
 The Los Angeles pilot began in 2021 and smaller trials are under way elsewhere as authorities grapple with a homelessness crisis that has led some cities, including Los Angeles, to declare states of emergency.
 Of the hundreds of people the new LA Homeless Prevention Unit has worked with so far, about 87% retained their housing after they left the programme, said Dana Vanderford, associate director of homelessness prevention for the county’s health services department.
 “We often find them in a moment of crisis – we’ll call, and they’ll say, ‘I don’t know how you found me. I’m losing my housing next week and not sure what to do’,” Vanderford said.
 “Our ability to appear out of nowhere and intervene and resolve a crisis – we’re really proud of that,” she said.
 AI is also being used to help predict homelessness risk in Calgary, Canada, and Geoffrey Messier, who is helping with the development of that project, says the LA pilot could be a game-changer.
 “I hope it is a bit of a watershed moment,” said Messier, who is a professor of electrical and software engineering at the University of Calgary. “This is the first time machine-learning was an integral part in identifying people who needed help.”
 More than 653,000 people experienced homelessness in the United States in 2023, a 12% increase over the previous year, according to a US Housing and Urban Development report.
 Janey Rountree, executive director of the California Policy Lab at the University of California in Los Angeles, said recent research showed a one-time cash payment and other services could help stem that tide.
 Last year, the University of Notre Dame published a study that found that at-risk people in California’s Santa Clara County were 81% less likely to become homeless within six months of enrolment in a financial assistance programme.
 “If you get the household at the right moment, give them US$2,000 to US$6,000 (RM9,500 to RM28,500) of assistance to help pay debt or rent, you can put them back on a trajectory toward housing stability,” said Rountree, who helped spearhead the research that led to the creation of the LA pilot and is involved in its evaluation.
 But first local officials have to be able to find those in need, which is where the new AI pilot comes in.
 When an at-risk individual is identified, LA Homeless Prevention Unit case managers, like Jocelyn Bataz, go to work.
 “I call them out of the blue and introduce myself,” she said, explaining that some people are initially sceptical. She reassures them that the call is not a scam and then tries to find out about their housing situation, utility bills and other stresses.
 Within days those eligible can get financial assistance and access to other services to, for example, sort their debts, find childcare or a job and get insurance.
 Bataz said she also provides a lot of emotional support.
 “This is the right way to apply technology – to make sure we’re reaching folks who aren’t otherwise connected to homeless systems but are at risk,” said Alex Visotzky, a California-based senior policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
 AI tools can be more effective than manual approaches to find out who is most chronically in need of housing support, said Stephen Goldsmith, urban policy professor at Harvard University.
 “Because preventing (homelessness) is complex, AI tools can help cities be more effective by focusing necessary services on specific individuals and their needs.”
 AI is also being used in the Canadian city of London, in Ontario, where the homeless population doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Craig Cooper, director of London’s Housing Stability Services, said an AI tool is being used to analyse data from people already in the shelter system to identify who is most at risk and, so far, the model appears highly accurate.
 Similar efforts are under way in Calgary to address the fact that someone new to the shelter system typically has to wait a long time to qualify for housing assistance. But AI can crunch data from the first months in the system to assess longer-term risks.
 “If so, that increases their priority for support,” said Messier, from the University of Calgary.
 In Los Angeles, Sanchez is grateful to have her life back on track just a few months after leaving the programme. Her health concerns are being addressed, she will finish her high school degree in June, and she is expecting a baby.
 “It really helped a lot,” she said of the pilot. “I feel safer here now.” — Reuters",june breanna sanchez trouble rent landlord los angeles family eviction lifeline invisible algorithm sanchez precarious situation artificial intelligence tool innovative experiment los angeles identify resident risk home month tool analysis factor data county jail hospital safety net programme foster care system list people risk street city official counsel cash statistic nationwide homelessness crisis sanchez letter contact county department housing outreach worker health programme financial assistance rent car sanchez husband los angeles pilot trial authority homelessness crisis city los angeles emergency hundred people homeless prevention unit housing programme dana vanderford associate director homelessness prevention county health service department moment crisis call housing week vanderford ability intervene crisis predict homelessness risk canada geoffrey development project pilot game changer bit watershed moment messier professor electrical software engineering university calgary time machine integral identifying people people experienced homelessness united increase previous housing urban development report janey rountree executive director california policy lab university california los angeles time cash payment service tide university notre dame study risk people santa clara county homeless month enrolment financial assistance programme household moment assistance pay debt rent trajectory housing stability creation pilot evaluation local official pilot risk individual homeless prevention unit manager call blue introduce people sceptical reassures scam housing situation utility bill day eligible financial assistance access service sort debt childcare job insurance bataz lot emotional support apply technology folk homeless system risk california senior policy fellow national alliance homelessness tool effective manual approach housing support stephen goldsmith urban policy professor harvard university homelessness complex tool city effective focusing service specific individual canadian city london ontario homeless population covid pandemic craig cooper director housing stability service tool analyse data people system identify risk model accurate effort calgary address shelter system wait time housing assistance crunch data month system ass term risk priority support messier university calgary los angeles grateful life track month programme health concern finish school degree june baby lot pilot feel safer reuters,"[(1, 0.9971323)]",1
676089,Main,4,30/04/2024,Lines blurring between real and AI-made abuse material,,"KUALA LUMPUR: With the greater use of artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming increasingly difficult for law enforcement to distinguish between ­genuine child sexual abuse cases and AI-generated ones, says Unicef chief of child protection Saskia Blume.
 She said globally, AI is generating child sexual abuse material that appears more realistic.
 Based on Unicef’s Disrupting Harm report, an estimated 100,000 Internet-using children aged 12-17 in Malaysia had experienced instances of online child sexual exploitation and abuse in 2022, she added.
 “The number of children being affected and the material and ­videos being generated, are huge. Now with AI, the lines are blurred, especially when you have child sexual abuse material that involves a real child against the one used to spin off more and more material.
 “So, you don’t know if the child is acutely in danger now versus the old material, so the risk of law enforcement being overwhelmed is really high.
 “AI should be used by law enforcement to go through 100,000 pieces of such material in Malaysia, as it is huge,” she told The Star at the International Symposium on the Empowerment of the Children’s Commission here yesterday.
 Unicef child protection specialist Sivaselvi Supramaniam said industry players can play a role by helping detect Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM).
 Citing the “Safety by Design” proactive and preventative approach that focuses on embedding safety used by the eSafety Commissioner in Australia, she said it is important to start looking at prevention.
 “How can the industry play a role to detect and remove CSEM? Through Safety by Design, for example, technology companies can minimise online threats by anticipating, detecting and eliminating online harm before it occurs.
 “This means at the manufacturing stage of the phone, there are already tools to prevent CSEM from reaching the user.
 “We need to start looking at prevention because the way the Internet works and how chatbots generate images is too fast.
 “We can never keep up so we need to continue to block (harmful) images, we need to look at how we can prevent such images from reaching users,” she added.
 Children’s Commissioner Dr Farah Nini Dusuki said there is much danger to children who have been given access to gadgets for the sake of convenience.
 She said parents still need to communicate about taboo topics as their children are vulnerable to being exploited.
 “I think Malaysian children are very much vulnerable because there is a lack of communication ... between parents and children.
 “How much do parents know about the dangers lurking online, especially with exploitation, and the tools to monitor as well as prevent their children from becoming victims?
 “I think awareness among parents is still very low,” she added.",kuala artificial intelligence difficult law enforcement distinguish genuine child sexual abuse unicef chief child protection saskia blume child sexual abuse material realistic unicef harm report internet child malaysia instance online sexual exploitation child material video huge line child sexual abuse material real child material child danger versus material risk law enforcement law enforcement piece material malaysia huge star international symposium empowerment child commission yesterday unicef child protection specialist sivaselvi supramaniam industry player role detect child sexual exploitation material csem safety design proactive preventative approach safety esafety commissioner australia start prevention industry play role csem safety design technology company online threat online harm stage phone tool csem user start prevention internet chatbots image continue block harmful image image user child farah nini dusuki danger child access gadget convenience parent taboo topic child vulnerable exploited malaysian child vulnerable lack communication parent child parent danger online exploitation tool prevent child victim parent low,"[(6, 0.99410826)]",6
675679,StarBiz,12,29/04/2024,"Alphabet, Microsoft earnings show hefty AI bets are driving growth",,"LONDON: Alphabet and Microsoft ignited a rally in technology stocks with earnings that showed big artificial intelligence (AI) investments were driving growth, allaying doubts that their costly bets would take time to pay off after a soft forecast from Meta Platforms.
 Alphabet rose 10%, crossing US$2 trillion in market value with a gain of about US$180bil as it sweetened the pot for investors with its maiden dividend and a US$70bil stock buyback.
 The world’s fourth most valuable firm flirted with the milestone on an intraday basis over three years ago although it never closed above that level, according to LSEG Datastream.
 Microsoft gained nearly 3% and was set to add more than US$80bil to its market value.
 After pouring billions of dollars into the infrastructure needed to support AI applications, both Alphabet and Microsoft reported that their quarterly revenue growth was outpacing expectations as more users turn to services including the Copilot AI assistant and the Gemini chatbot.
 AI services accounted for seven percentage points of the 31% jump in revenue at Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing platform between January and March, finance chief Amy Hood said.
 She added near-term AI demand was a bit higher than the company’s capacity, which held back growth in the quarter and highlighted the need for spending to expand its infrastructure.
 At Google, cloud revenue jumped about 28% with strong growth in Google Workspace, where the Alphabet unit offers a slew of AI features powered by its large language model Gemini.
 The results contrasted with a warning of higher spending and softer-than-expected growth from social media giant Meta, whose stock tumbled 10% last Thursday.
 “This quarter illustrated how demand remains high for generative AI from Microsoft customers, and we continue to believe that Microsoft sits as a leader in this GenAI environment,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.
 “Meta is indicating the results of further increased investment may be years away while Microsoft and Google are showing them right now.”
 The results sparked a rise of 2% in Amazon.com, which will report earnings tomorrow. AI chip stocks Nvidia , Broadcom and Marvell Technology also rose between 1% and 2%, riding on optimism that an ongoing boom in spending by tech giants would power demand for their semiconductors.
 “The three hyperscalers (major cloud companies) we’ve heard from thus far all highlighted a similar message on AI capital expenditure – this is an arms race, the AI opportunity is enormous, and spending will continue to be aggressive or ahead of market expectations,” Bernstein analyst Michael Chiang said.
 Microsoft’s capital expenditures grew by US$300mil from the previous quarter to US$11.5bil, while Alphabet’s capital expenditures were US$12bil, a 91% jump from a year prior.
 At least 19 analysts raised their price target on Alphabet, pushing the median view to US$176.65, compared with its last close of US$156. Microsoft saw 17 price-target increases from analysts, with the median view on the stock now at US$475.

675883,Main,9,29/04/2024,STEERING MALAYSIA’S WORKFORCE FOR  A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE,Human Resources Ministry continues to ensure that Malaysia’s workforce can thrive in emerging sectors,"MANPOWER has always been hailed as the backbone of any country, driving its progress, innovation, and economic growth. However, as the landscape of work continues to evolve rapidly, the future of employment is being reshaped by technological advancements, changing market dynamics, and the need for specialised skillsets. 
 In Malaysia, the Human Resources Ministry (Kesuma) plays a vital role in leading the development and management of the nation’s human resources. 
 Kesuma is tasked with the mission to develop and nurture competent, productive, responsive, and resilient human capital in the country’s labour market, ultimately enhancing national productivity.
 The future of work
 The future of work encompasses job sectors anticipated to gain considerable attention or prominence in the coming years, reflecting shifts in labour market dynamics and emerging priorities. 
 Emerging sectors such as sustainable energy, smart infrastructure, data analytics, and cybersecurity are poised to redefine the job market. 
 Roles such as new energy engineers, smart city and smart home architects and engineers, big data analysts, Internet of Things (IoT) experts, and cybersecurity specialists are becoming increasingly essential, promising to shape the future workforce and drive innovation.
 The demand for skilled professionals in these sectors is driven by the urgent need to address global challenges such as climate change, urbanisation, and cybersecurity threats. 
 New energy engineers are tasked with developing sustainable energy solutions, while smart city architects and engineers design interconnected urban environments to enhance efficiency and quality of life. 
 Big data analysts extract valuable insights from large datasets, informing decision-making processes in various industries. 
 IoT experts specialise in designing and implementing interconnected systems, revolutionising industries and enhancing everyday experiences. 
 Meanwhile, cybersecurity specialists safeguard digital infrastructures from cyber threats, ensuring the security and integrity of data in an increasingly interconnected world.
 With these evolving demands for the future job market, Kesuma continuously adapts its strategies and initiatives to ensure that the workforce is equipped with the necessary skills and competencies to thrive in these emerging sectors and contribute to Malaysia’s sustainable development and economic growth.Importance of upskilling and reskillingAmidst the promise of new opportunities, there exists a pressing need for upskilling and reskilling initiatives to bridge the gap between available jobs and the skills of the workforce. 
 Studies reveal concerning trends of underemployment and skills mismatch among young graduates. Many individuals find themselves in jobs that do not align with their field of study or skillset, contributing to high rates of underemployment.
 According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), the underemployment related to skill utilisation rate until October 2023 was 37.4%. 
 Skill mismatch in industries correlates with this. 
 To address this challenge, the government and industries are ramping up efforts to enhance training programmes and educational curricula. They have collaborated to improve the situation by enhancing and building more relevant training programmes for the job market’s needs. 
 Upskilling and reskilling programmes for youths and graduates seeking employment are already underway, aiming to equip individuals with the competencies needed to thrive in the digital economy.
 Malaysia continues to face the impact of increasing technology and automation on the job market. While technology creates new job opportunities, it also raises concerns about job displacement, especially in traditional industries. Reskilling and upskilling programmes aim to address these challenges, preparing the workforce for roles in the digital economy.
 Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programmes play a crucial role in addressing unemployment and skills mismatch, providing individuals with practical skills that are in high demand in the job market. TVET is one method to help strengthen the labour market and enhance the country’s competitiveness in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and beyond.
 Science, Technology, Engineer­ing, and Mathematics (STEM) education, which emphasises technology-related skills and digital literacy, is garnering growing interest from industries, reflecting the increasing demand for technology professionals.
 The government continues to support educational institutions to offer more programmes in this field to address the growing demand for technology professionals. It encourages development of comprehensive reskilling and upskilling programmes focusing on workforce adaptability and inspires individuals to acquire new skills and certifications in response to changing industry demands.
 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s mandate on March 1, 2024 to Kesuma to propose and implement new training initiatives to produce competent workers reinforces the government’s commitment to this cause. 
 Furthermore, to facilitate the transition of higher education and TVET students into the workforce, Kesuma through Talent Corporation Malaysia Bhd (TalentCorp) and HRD Corp, has been mandated to introduce the practical training incentive or ILHAM Kesuma, which was recently announced by Human Resources Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong.
 TalentCorp, an agency under Kesuma established in 2011, drives the nation’s talent strategy towards making Malaysia a dynamic and market-oriented global talent hub. 
 As a think-tank for Kesuma, it is tasked with spearheading research on Artificial Intelligence (AI), digitalisation and workforce sustainability. 
 TalentCorp will also develop the Future Skills Framework for each of the 10 sectors and develop a Future Skills digital platform for workers, institutions, companies, and policymakers to utilise effectively. 
 The aim is to develop frameworks and platforms that support lifelong learning and skills development, ensuring that the workforce remains agile and resilient in the face of change. 
 In addition, there is mynext by TalentCorp, an all-in-one talent solution and analytics platform for students, universities, companies, and the workforce. It supports students and individuals of the workforce by providing access to profiling tools that help them discover their work value, and interests, most employable traits and connect them directly to ideal internship opportunities. 
 As of December 31, 2022:	> 233,556 students were profiled for the workforce with 10,656 companies; 			> For the National Structured Internship programme (MYSIP), there were 111,326 internship placements; 			> Under the Semester Break Programme (SBP), there were 5,670 registered students with 19,693 live views on Zoom and Facebook Live across the 89 sessions organised. The SBP targets Malaysian students returning home for holidays, aiming to familiarise them with Malaysia’s key economic sectors through meetings with industry leaders, experts, and visits to iconic infrastructure projects.
 Findings for future planning
 The World Economic Forum report emphasises that the future of work landscape is influenced by dynamic and complex factors. Based on the 2023 trend study, the economy, health, and geopolitics have affected the shape of the global labour market.
 According to an online job search and career development site, Zippia’s research indicates that by 2030:			> 85% of current jobs will not exist in 2030;			> The automation sector has the potential to eliminate 47% of jobs (in the United States), equivalent to 73 million jobs	;		> 37% of workers will work from home.
 These findings lead to drastic changes in the education sector to produce graduates who can meet market demands.
 The Critical Occupations List (MyCOL) 2022/2023 TalentCorp report also highlights several challenges that need attention. These include:			> Shortage of skilled workers;	> Mismatch of jobs with fields of study;				> Difficulty in retaining talent.
 Kesuma continues to monitor such findings for future planning and management of the workforce.
 Labour Day celebration
 The upcoming Labour Day celebration on May 1 will be officiated by Anwar and attended by over 3,000 workers from various unions, statutory bodies, public, and private sectors at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre.
 Anwar is scheduled to present several Labour Day awards at the gathering as a gesture of appreciation for the contributions of workers to the nation’s development. 
 This year, 12 awards will be conferred to workers, employers, unions, media, and contingents. In addition, the premier will also launch the Human Resources Policy Framework 2030.
 About 20 activities have been planned in conjunction with the Labour Day celebrations, such as four Pocket Talk Series, Labour Day Run, Occupational Safety and Health Practitioners Gathering, Perdana Forum, and Career Carnival offering 10,000 job opportunities and exhibitions by government departments and agencies. 
 These programmes aim to raise awareness among the public about workers’ and employers’ rights and responsibilities, job opportunities, and technical skills courses offered to youths.

675901,Lifestyle,4,29/04/2024,Addressing homelessness with AI,"A US city is using artificial intelligence to spot homeless encampments, sparking a debate on technology’s role  in social issues.","Across the United States, cities have begun experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) to map potholes, reduce traffic and fight wildfires. In San Jose, officials are now harnessing the rapidly evolving technology with another goal in mind: detecting homeless encampments.
 Three times since December, a white city-owned Toyota sedan affixed with a half-dozen small cameras has cruised through South San Jose to collect footage of parked cars and RVs (recreational vehicles). The images were then fed into different AI systems developed by four private companies to determine whether people were living inside the vehicles.
 The open-ended pilot programme, thought to be the first of its kind nationwide, may soon also seek to identify tent encampments and could one day expand to a permanent fleet of vehicles that crisscross the city.
 While homeless advocates fear the effort could lead to more encampment sweeps and impounded lived-in RVs, city officials say they are optimistic it will help connect homeless people with needed services, shelter or housing.
 The programme is not designed to collect identifying footage of licence plates or people’s faces, officials stressed.“We’re not interested in the individual identities of people who are living outside,” said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan. “But we do need to know where all the lived-in vehicles in the city are so that we can manage them.”
 The programme, first made public by The Guardian, comes as Mahan pushes to “end the era of encampments” as residents have grown increasingly frustrated with street homelessness.
 At the mayor’s urging, the City Council agreed earlier this year to develop policies to ban RVs near schools, restrict oversized-vehicle parking across the city, and establish new tow-away zones. The city estimates it has more than 800 lived-in RVs.
 At the same time, city officials are devising plans to move around 1,000 homeless people from local waterways and into shelters. San Jose has an estimated 6,300 homeless residents, about 70% of whom live outdoors or in vehicles. The rest stay in shelters.
 In addition to responding to encampments, San Jose’s pilot programme aims to help identify trash, graffiti, potholes and parking violations. Other cities already use AI for those purposes, but San Jose appears to be the first to employ the technology to spot RVs or tents with people living inside, according to AI experts and national homeless advocates.
 Tami Rule moved into an RV parked in a residential area near Highway 87 and Capitol Expressway last year after a fire destroyed the apartment she shared with her husband in San Jose’s West San Carlos neighbourhood.
 Rule, 56, said her biggest concern about the programme is people gawking at footage of the plastic bins filled with clothes and shoes, small potted plants and other belongings the couple keeps stacked outside their vehicle.
 “But for somebody to understand what it’s like to live in a camper,” she said. “I wouldn’t mind that.”
 Elsewhere in the Bay Area, San Francisco, Oakland, Fremont and Mountain View officials said they had no plans to use AI to track encampments.
 Still, experts said it’s not hard to imagine cities following San Jose’s lead. Last month, Mahan hosted officials from the White House and local governments across the country for a virtual forum on using AI to improve public services.
 Vishnu Pendyala, an AI professor and researcher at San Jose State University, said the technology has “huge potential” for detecting homeless camps. But he also noted the privacy concerns surrounding the pilot programme and other fledgling AI efforts.“We have already seen many things being hacked and many things being misused,” Pendyala said. He pointed to reports of Apple contractors allegedly listening to recordings of iPhone users’ queries to Siri, a program powered by AI.
 Officials from the city and the companies working on the pilot said that protecting people’s privacy is a top priority – in part by explicitly instructing AI systems to ignore faces and licence plate numbers.
 “Whether we like it or not, AI is going to be a dominant technology,” said Khaled Tawfik, San Jose’s chief information officer. “We want to be the leaders in discovering the risk and finding ways to mitigate it.”
 Tawfik said his department is not sharing any information with other local agencies or the police department during the pilot, and any data or footage distributed in the future would obscure identifying details.
 San Jose started the programme, which is currently limited to South San Jose’s Council District 10, in response to the thousands of 311 calls it receives each year to report vehicles that appear abandoned, Tawfik said. He said the city aims to proactively identify which vehicles have people living in them so officials know where to send homeless outreach teams.
 So far, the pilot has identified lived-in RVs with about 70% accuracy. It recognised lived-in cars correctly only about 10% to 15% of the time.
 Masaf Dawood, a vice president with San Mateo-based Xloop Digital, one of the companies involved in the pilot, expects those numbers to improve as the AI analyses thousands more images.He said this is the first time a city has asked the company to identify lived-in vehicles. Xloop Digital’s software looks for markers, including litter on the roadway, lines of parked RVs, and unexpected objects, such as a coffee maker on a vehicle dashboard.
 Despite the technology’s potential, Dawood still anticipates a margin of error. “I don’t think we can say, or that we should say, ‘Oh, we can be 100%’,” he said.
 The other companies that have taken part in the pilot are Sensen.AI, CityRover and Mountain View-based Blue Dome Technologies.
 Todd Langton, executive director of the homeless advocacy group Agape Silicon Valley, worries the programme could “turbo charge” the city’s push to move RVs off its streets.Langton said towing unhoused people’s vehicles not only takes their shelter but often forces them to part with personal belongings, important documents or medication, potentially exacerbating any mental health and drug issues.
 Many residents, meanwhile, want the city to take a tougher stance on vehicle and tent encampments. Students at KIPP San Jose Collegiate, a high school in East San Jose, pressured city officials to move forward with the RV ban near schools, saying homeless people have broken into school buildings and left needles on lunch tables.
 As San Jose officials ramp up enforcement, they say they want to ensure homeless people have safe places to go. They point to recent efforts to build hundreds of tiny home shelters and open safe overnight parking lots with supportive services.
 Even so, those solutions aren’t coming fast enough, Langton said. The city still lacks enough beds for everyone on the street, and with a severe shortage of affordable housing, most people who move through local shelters don’t find lasting homes.
 “It’s just a drop in the bucket of what needs to be done,” Langton said. – Bay Area News Group/Tribune News Service",united city artificial intelligence map pothole traffic fight san jose official technology goal mind homeless encampment time white city toyota sedan half dozen camera south san jose collect footage car rv recreational vehicle image system private company people inside vehicle programme nationwide seek identify tent encampment day permanent fleet vehicle city homeless advocate effort lead encampment sweep lived rv city official optimistic connect homeless people service housing programme collect identifying footage licence people official individual identity people san jose mayor matt mahan vehicle city manage programme public guardian mahan push era resident grown frustrated street homelessness mayor city council earlier policy rv school oversized vehicle city tow zone city estimate rv time city official plan homeless people local waterway shelter homeless resident outdoors vehicle stay shelter addition encampment san jose pilot programme trash graffiti pothole violation city san jose employ technology spot rv tent people expert national homeless tami rule residential highway capitol fire apartment husband san jose west san carlos neighbourhood rule biggest concern programme people footage plastic bin clothes shoe plant belonging couple vehicle understand camper mind bay san francisco oakland fremont mountain view official track encampment expert city jose lead month official white house local government country virtual forum public service vishnu pendyala professor researcher san jose university technology huge potential homeless camp privacy concern pilot programme effort misused pendyala report apple contractor recording iphone user query program official city company people top priority system licence plate dominant technology tawfik san jose chief officer leader risk mitigate tawfik department local agency department pilot data footage future obscure identifying detail jose south san jose council district response thousand receives report vehicle tawfik city identify vehicle people official homeless outreach team lived rv accuracy lived car time masaf dawood vice president mateo xloop digital company pilot thousand image time city company lived vehicle digital software marker litter roadway line rv unexpected object coffee maker vehicle dashboard technology potential dawood anticipates error company sensen view blue dome technology langton executive director homeless advocacy agape silicon valley worry turbo charge city push rv street unhoused people vehicle shelter force personal belonging document medication mental health drug issue resident city stance vehicle tent student san jose collegiate school east san jose pressured city official ban school homeless people broken school building needle lunch table jose official enforcement homeless people safe effort hundred tiny shelter safe overnight lot supportive service solution langton city bed street severe shortage affordable housing people local shelter home drop bucket langton bay news tribune news service,"[(1, 0.99773335)]",1
675527,Main,18,28/04/2024,AI and  the gig economy deliver an opportunity,"Ahead of Labour Day on Wednesday,  these academics look at the future of work.","NEW tech such as generative AI is reshaping how we live and work.
 Young professionals with digital skills stand to cash in on the inevitable changes AI will bring to the job market. Emerging nations, which can recognise these changes and arm their workforce with those same skills, can ride the wave too. 
 Researchers forecast a shift towards knowledge-intensive activities, with jobs such as statisticians and software engineers, critical to the development of artificial intelligence systems, being the ones in demand. 
 They anticipate that employment prospects will increasingly revolve around computing, research, system management, law, engineering, health, architecture and education.
 The people doing these jobs are evolving as well. The idea of a graduate leaving university with one set of skills and relying on those skills to stay relevant for 40 years is over. 
 No longer tied to an office desk in the city, they are gig workers, freelancers and digital nomads, working from home, the local cafe or wherever there is a reliable internet connection. Although all types of independent workers share elements of independence and flexibility in their working arrangements, they differ in terms of lifestyle, the nature of their work and their relationship with employers or clients. 
 Gig workers typically perform short-term tasks or projects, and their work is not necessarily location-independent. Freelancers are self-employed and offer their services to clients. They may work remotely, but can also work on-site if required. 
 Digital nomads use technology to work remotely and live a location-independent lifestyle. The digital nomad visa is new because of this lifestyle.
 Emerging economies are beginning to cash in on these styles of work. The growing gig economy offers chances for individuals in numerous developing nations to make money, develop fresh skills and connect with professional networks.
 A proliferation of new platforms worldwide catering to specialised industries, along with local platforms addressing country-specific demands for both skilled and low-skilled workers, are transforming the global workforce. 
 Around 12% of the global labour market consists of gig workers. There are 545 online gig work platforms worldwide (three-quarters are regional or local), with clients and workers from 186 countries. Forty percent of traffic to gig platforms comes from low- and middle-income countries. 
 Asian nations are seizing the chance offered by online outsourcing and remote gig work to generate millions of job opportunities for their people. 
 The pool of professional gig workers predominantly hails from lower-income countries. 
 India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, for example, are home to millions of professionals who offer services in web and software development, graphic design, content writing and digital marketing. India alone has around 15 million gig workers in human resources, IT and design.
 Meanwhile, the number of freelancers worldwide has reached 1.57 billion (47% of the global workforce). The freelance industry in the United States has grown by 78% to 73.3 million. This is expected to rise to 76.4 million by 2024, with AI creating new opportunities.  
 One study shows that 84% of freelancers live their preferred lifestyle and 70% claim that they choose to work as freelancers to improve work-life balance. 
 The United States, India and the Philippines stand out as major contributors to the freelance workforce, with Japan emerging as one of the top 10 countries experiencing freelancer growth. 
 While freelancers in the US primarily secure gig work from local clients, those in developing nations like India, Pakistan and the Philippines rely heavily on overseas clients, accounting for approximately 90% of their assignments. This dynamic presents significant opportunities for job creation, reduced unemployment, and economic advancement in these countries.
 Digital nomads now number around 17 million in the US. Indeed, the US accounts for about half of the digital nomad community worldwide. It is predicted that by 2027, more than half the US workforce will participate in the gig economy. 
 This growth offers an array of opportunities for gig workers and employers alike. The number of online communities and professional networks providing support, networking opportunities, and a sense of community for gig workers is on the rise.
 Having access to the external workforce is important for finding rare skills such as blockchain development, quantum computing, sustainable fashion design, machine learning, statistical modelling, data visualisation, ethical hacking, and threat detection. An increasingly AI-reliant economy underscores the importance of continual reskilling and upskilling for the workforce to remain relevant. 
 With strategic investments in infrastructure and training, emerging and developing countries can harness AI to compete in the global market and attract employers. 
 AI-driven platforms have the potential to provide tailored training designed specifically for individuals. These platforms can deliver personalised learning experiences and recommend relevant courses, tutorials, or resources to strengthen candidates’ abilities and improve their chances of securing employment.
 Additionally, AI will empower individuals with disabilities to utilise their professional skills, integrating them into the country’s talent pools and expanding their opportunities for accessing professional jobs through online platforms.
 Future employees will need diverse skills, including problem-solving, data analysis, collaboration, communication, relationship-building, and judgment. The education system needs to adapt to produce these workers. 
 For developing economies, the key lies in establishing a solid foundation through investment in digital infrastructure and nurturing a digitally proficient workforce that can leverage AI for optimum productivity. 
 As for income inequality, job polarisation and unemployment, they are intricately linked to the impact of AI on labour economics. How AI will cause unemployment depends on how quickly people learn the needed new skills (upskilling and reskilling). The faster markets adapt, the less unemployment there’ll be. 
 There is concern about the potential job displacement caused by generative AI, raising questions about its impact, especially in high-skilled sectors. 
 However, despite this, high-skill workers have seen improved employment opportunities post-AI emergence. AI exposure correlates with increased job growth in occupations requiring extensive computer use, indicating higher skill levels. There is also a growing concern that AI benefits may disproportionately favour a select few individuals or businesses, exacerbating income disparities. 
 Skilled professionals proficient in building, implementing, and managing AI systems may witness increased demand and higher wages, while low-skilled workers may face stagnant pay and reduced job prospects. — 360info™

675187,Main,5,27/04/2024,AI content must not cross the line,Concerns over the tech being misused in by-elections,"PETALING JAYA: Advanced chatbots and apps have made it easier for even the most novice of content creators to generate election campaign materials, but this has also caused concerns of artificial intelligence (AI) being misused.
 Some content creators claim that the toxic and defamatory AI-generated content during election campaigns is usually not party-­endorsed but made voluntarily by party “vigilantes”.
 Content creator Ramli Ali said even before ChatGPT became popular, he had been using AI to assist him in creating visuals of politicians.
 “For political campaigning, AI content can be generated easily. All you have to do is request whatever you want from the app.
 “Then, you just have to add finishing touches to the images and your watermark to make it yours.
 “AI-generated content is legal. The question is whether the content is ethical or morally acceptable to all parties.
 “Election campaigns can be very vicious, with personal attacks and defamatory remarks. We content creators have to be careful to ensure that we do not cross the line.
 “Professional content creators know the moral lines not to be crossed,” said Ramli, adding that most content creators using AI-generated content work in the shadows.
 (While AI-generated content is still legal, there are many lawsuits going on in the United States and Europe, filed by creators who say their copyrighted works were used without their permission to “train” AI tools).
 Another content creator, who wanted to be known only as Tan, said creators have to be quick but creative to make sure their content is effective during election campaigns.
 “Time is short during by-elections. The defensive content is what we have to come up with instantly. There is no time to waste, or the rival will have the upper hand,” he said.
 Tan said the “cheap and defamatory ones” are not done by content creators but by party supporters who get ahead of themselves and do not follow any guidelines.
 While AI content is being used to vie for voter attention, political party leaders in charge of social media campaigning for the Kuala Kubu Baharu by-election said content creators cannot do as they please.
 PKR information chief Fahmi Fadzil, who is also Communications Minister, said he will not hesitate to crack the whip on those who misuse AI to propagate hate.
 “There are many scams which mislead the people, apart from those posts that defame and spread lies,” he said.
 He added that the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has been directed to take action against these.
 Umno supreme council member Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan said the party has a special team of lawyers monitoring content posted by its rivals, including parties in the government, during campaigning.
 “We have a team headed by information chief Datuk Seri Azalina Othman,” he said when contacted, referring to the Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institu­tional Reforms).
 An Umno official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the party has guidelines that any materials used in attacking rivals must not be unethical or breach the law.
 DAP national publicity secretary Teo Nie Ching had also said that she believes there will be more fake accounts impersonating party candidates or leaders to spread disinformation and hate speech during the Kuala Kubu Baharu by-election.
 “Pang Sock Tao’s candidacy was announced on Wednesday. ­Yester­day, someone used her ­photos to create a fake account on Facebook,” she said.
 Teo, who is also Deputy Commu­nications Minister, said with the help of AI, generating content has become easy.
 Selangor PAS information chief Zurk Ahmad said the party is very careful with what its content ­creators post on social media as it has many political enemies.
 “Among the guidelines given to content creators are that all content must be in line with party principles, uphold people’s priorities, and be based on facts, not perceptions.
 “PAS uses AI on a small scale to assist our campaigners and party volunteers to speed up their production.
 “Overall, PAS uses more ‘human intelligence’, using big data analysis and data engineering that is geared towards information. PAS has a specific workforce for each task,” he added.
 Zurk said the party also constantly monitors all social media platforms on any issue that has to do with PAS.

674792,StarBiz,10,26/04/2024,AI memory boom propels SK Hynix’s numbers,Company reports doubling in quarterly sales,"Seoul: SK Hynix Inc says it expects a full recovery in the memory market, led by surging demand related to artificial intelligence (AI), and lifted its capital spending plans.
 The leader in the high-bandwidth memory that powers Nvidia Corp’s AI accelerators declared it has entered a rebound phase, after posting its fastest pace of revenue growth since 2010, and said it’s preparing bigger outlays to expand capacity of its leading-edge chips.
 The world’s tech companies are locked in a race to supply components essential to creating generative AI services. SK Hynix earlier said it’s investing some US$15bil in South Korea to meet surging demand for such high-end chips, on top of a plan to spend US$3.9bil on an advanced packaging plant and research centre for AI products in Indiana. 
 The company said it’s increasing the supply of its leading-edge HBM3E chips and in talks with a number of customers on long-term contracts for such semiconductors.
 Overall memory demand is also on a steady growth path, it said, citing double-digit price rises in the broader DRAM market and a rebound in NAND prices. 
 That more than doubled the world’s No. 2 memory maker’s quarterly sales, the company’s fastest pace of revenue expansion in over a decade, while operating profit blew past estimates.
 Shares in SK Hynix, which have gained 27% this year, fell 3.9% during trading yesterday in Seoul, part of a broader selloff in Asian equity markets following Meta Platforms Inc’s weak outlook. Bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co shed 2.3%.
 The company’s capacity for high-end memory is fully booked for this year and it needs new factories to keep up with the demand, said Tom Kang, director at Counterpoint Research. SK Hynix is expected to hit revenue of almost 61 trillion won and a profit margin of more than 20% this year, he said. 
 “This is a clear turnaround and the start of a record breaking year for SK Hynix,” he said. The company has said it expects demand for high-end memory to grow 60% a year.
 Strong demand for AI server products is also helping to bolster prices of DRAM. Demand for enterprise solid-state drives helped SK Hynix’s NAND business return to profitability in the first quarter, according to chief operating officer Kim Woo Hyun, who spoke on an earnings call. 
 Investment in 2024 will be slightly higher than planned at the start of the year, with the bulk of spending to focus on high-margin products and infrastructure for medium-term growth, Kim said.
 “Any impact on near-term supply and demand of conventional products will be limited,” he said. “We will  balance investing in future growth with ensuring financial soundness, given our current level of cash generation.”
 In the March quarter, SK Hynix reported a higher-than-expected revenue of 12.4 trillion won, up 144% from a year ago. 
 Operating income was 2.89 trillion won, its second-highest first-quarter operating profit on record and outperforming estimates of 1.8 trillion won. 
 SK Hynix is reporting days after Texas Instruments Inc gave a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter, indicating that a slump in demand for industrial and automotive components may be easing. 
 Samsung’s preliminary operating profit also showed a sharp rebound in the first quarter, while Micron Technology Inc last month gave a strong sales forecast.
 SK Hynix has been fighting to keep its lead over Samsung, which has pledged to focus its formidable resources on catching up in high-end memory. 
 The newest SK Hynix factory will be built near its existing production base in Cheongju. Separately, SK Hynix is proceeding with other domestic investments including in the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster, where it’ll ultimately inject about 120 trillion won. 
 The company plans to start construction of the first fab in Yongin next year, for completion in 2027. — Bloomberg",seoul hynix recovery memory market demand artificial intelligence capital spending plan leader memory power corp accelerator rebound phase fastest pace revenue growth bigger outlay capacity edge chip company race supply component essential generative service hynix bil south korea meet demand chip top plan bil packaging plant centre product company supply edge hbm chip talk customer term contract semiconductor demand steady growth double digit price rise dram market rebound nand price memory maker quarterly sale company fastest pace revenue expansion decade operating profit blew share hynix yesterday broader selloff asian equity market platform weak outlook bigger rival samsung electronics company capacity memory factory tom kang director counterpoint hynix hit revenue profit margin start record hynix company demand memory strong demand server product bolster price dram demand enterprise solid drive hynix nand business profitability quarter chief officer kim hyun earnings call investment bulk spending focus margin product medium term growth impact term supply conventional product balance future growth financial soundness current level cash generation quarter hynix expected revenue income quarter operating profit record outperforming estimate hynix day texas instrument bullish revenue current quarter slump demand industrial automotive component samsung preliminary operating profit sharp rebound quarter micron technology month strong sale hynix lead samsung formidable resource memory hynix factory production base cheongju hynix domestic investment yongin semiconductor cluster inject company start construction fab yongin completion bloomberg,"[(0, 0.9960019)]",0

673982,Main,8,23/04/2024,AI portal to take on scammers,"More emphasis needed to combat misinformation and fake news, says minister","PUTRAJAYA: A portal using artificial intelligence (AI) will be ­created to help people verify the information they receive, repel defamatory news and fight fraud or scams, says Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil.
 The portal, he said, would be expanded from the special segment Biar Betul! that is broadcast on RTM, as the segment – which is less than a minute long – was insufficient and needed to be revved up to deal with the issue, Bernama reported.
 “It is still in the early stages but there is a need so that people in general do not have to doubt the material they read. If there is any doubt, they can refer (to the portal).
 “Today we can watch Biar Betul! on various platforms including on RTM where scam material and fake and defamatory content are exposed every day, but we see that it is not enough and needs to be improved,” he said after launching the Jom Baca Bersama 10 Minit programme at the Communications Ministry here yesterday.
 According to Fahmi, the new platform will strengthen the capabilities of existing platforms such as Sebenarnya.my under the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and MyCheck.my managed by the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama), as well as Biar Betul!, to make it easier for people to search for and verify any information they receive.
 Fahmi said the ministry will also work with social media platforms so that information received by users goes through a process as practised on the X platform (formerly Twitter) that allows users to attach “Community Notes” to a post.
 In addition, a total of 1,878 “Madani communities” across the country can also be used as Biar Betul! agents as the front line to fend off defamation, correct perceptions and check facts with the ministry to ensure that the  delivery of information to the community is done more clearly and in an organised manner, he added.
 Fahmi said the matter is being taken seriously since MCMC information showed that almost 80% of the content downloaded until April was of a scam nature, including advertising fraud and online gambling.
 Earlier, in his speech, he said the theme of the Jom Baca Bersama 10 Minit programme, “Reading Preserves Unity”, is very much in line with the Madani concept that reflects the emphasis on building a civilised society, giving each other insight and fostering unity.
 Organised jointly by the Communications Ministry’s Resource Centre and the Infor­mation Department’s Resource and Photo Centre, the programme was held in conjunction with World Book and Copyright Day, celebrated worldwide on April 23 every year.

 Lenovo, which launched China’s first batch of AI PCs in Shanghai last Thursday, said the machines could automatically build artwork presentations and synthesise knowledge based on stored documents. They suit a range of users, from primary school students to scientists working in Antarctica.
 Yang Yuanqing, chairman of Lenovo, said the transition of AI from technological breakthroughs to practical applications marks the beginning of the second half of AI’s development.
 Yang said it is highly important to accumulate user feedback and continuously improve AI technology through real-world applications.
 He highlighted the demanding computational requirements for AI-powered PCs, and envisioned a future where every individual possesses a personal intelligent entity that can seamlessly integrate into PCs or smartphones.
 Market research company Canalys has forecast that about 48 million AI-capable PCs will be shipped worldwide this year, representing 18 percent of total PC sales, and the figure will top 100 million units in 2025 to account for 40% of total PC sales. — China Daily/ANN",chinese technology company chip giant corp qualcomm artificial intelligence pc computer meet demand productivity tool china batch pc shanghai thursday machine artwork presentation knowledge stored document suit range user primary school student scientist chairman lenovo transition technological breakthrough practical application mark half development yang accumulate user feedback technology real application computational requirement powered pc future individual posse personal intelligent entity integrate pc smartphones market company forecast capable pc percent total sale top unit total sale daily ann,"[(2, 0.9878654)]",2
673338,Main,5,22/04/2024,Students rely heavily on AI to excel in coursework,,"PETALING JAYA: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools such as ChatGPT has become increasingly popular among students. They find that it is quick to provide and compile information as well as simple to use.
 Software engineering diploma student Vincent Ong, 21, said the use of AI writing tools for research has become the norm among most of his friends and peers.
 “We mainly use it as a research model to find information, but I personally still find information from actual sources for comparison. The use of AI just makes all the tedious work of finding information from various sources and summarising it so much faster while also providing details that I was not aware of before,” he said.
 Ong added that while useful, AI writing tools should not be used to do an entire assignment or coursework.
 Information and communication technology (ICT) diploma student Jordan Lim, 20, said the use of AI is becoming popular just like the search engine Google among his classmates.
 “We use it very frequently and pretty much for everything as the explicit answers and information it provides are usually more ­thorough than those found in indivi­dual articles online. It helps explain certain parts or derive answers for topics that I struggle in, though we do not copy an entire assignment based on the answers it provides,” Lim said.
 Journalism degree student Christian Chung, 21, said using AI has become common among his peers and friends to generate ideas for their coursework.
 “AI writing tools give a good starting point for us to build on as they are much faster at finding and compiling relevant information. They also help me to identify informative relevant links to what I’m writing on,” he said.
 Chung added that while using AI writing tools for an entire assignment would be unethical, the generated content and information from such tools are fair game as long as they meet assignment requirements.
 However, a 22-year old ICT student, Hazeeq, expressed concern over AI as some of his coursemates use it during exams.
 “Using ChatGPT has become a daily routine for them when it comes to all coursework, from assignments to quizzes and even during exams at times.
 “I’m worried that some of my friends could become lazy and just depend entirely on AI writing tools to solve not just their coursework, but also other matters,” he said.
 Hazeeq said while he does not use AI to that extreme, he uses it often to help him learn better. He said AI helps to generate ideas and identify issues in his coding coursework.
 “When I run out of ideas for a website, ChatGPT helps generate sample code ideas for me to start from, while highlighting and explaining my coding errors clearly so I don’t make the same mistakes again,” he added.",jaya artificial intelligence writing tool popular student quick compile simple software engineering diploma student vincent writing tool norm friend peer actual source comparison tedious finding source detail aware ong writing tool entire assignment coursework communication technology ict diploma student jordan lim popular search engine google pretty explicit answer dual article derive answer topic copy entire assignment answer journalism degree student christian chung common peer friend idea writing tool build relevant identify informative relevant link chung writing tool entire assignment unethical content tool fair game meet assignment requirement ict student hazeeq concern exam chatgpt daily routine coursework assignment exam time worried friend lazy writing tool coursework matter extreme learn idea issue coursework idea chatgpt sample code idea error mistake,"[(1, 0.14040384), (2, 0.85336107)]",2
673340,Main,5,22/04/2024,Balancing academic integrity and AI,"The technology has a place in education but needs proper integration, say experts","PETALING JAYA: It’s been a year since plagiarism detection platform Turnitin launched its artificial intelligence (AI) writing detec­tion feature, and its findings are astonishing.
 Of more than 200 million papers reviewed as at March 21 this year, over 22 million or about 11% had at least 20% of AI writing present.
 More surprisingly, over six million or approximately 3% of the over 200 million papers reviewed had at least 80% AI writing, Turnitin said in a recent statement.
 The detection feature integrates the AI writing report within the existing Turnitin workflow, providing educators with an overall percentage of the document that AI writing tools, like the ever-popu­lar ChatGPT, may have gene­rated.
 Turnitin said the consistent presence of AI writing in their data highlighted a continued need to view the use of AI writing tools in education as a “complex, ever-evolving puzzle”.
 “Educators and institutions should look at various factors, or puzzle pieces, beyond detection.
 “This includes open discussions with students regarding accep­table uses of AI writing in the classroom, reviewing academic policies and revising essay prompts,” it said.
 Turnitin chief product officer Annie Chechitelli said it is an important juncture in education where technologies transform learning and academic integrity is at stake.
 “Everyone in education is loo­k­ing for resources to enable them to perform at their best, as well as technologies, including our AI writing detection feature, to help advance learning without sacrificing academic integrity,” she said in the same statement.
 Turnitin also cited a recent study finding that nearly all students surveyed had used generative AI tools such as ChatGPT monthly, weekly or daily.
 “The survey found that 75% of those surveyed say they will continue to use the technology even if faculties or institutions ban them,” it said, noting generative AI usage’s growth over the past year with more to come.
 With this revelation, tertiary institutions say that educating students on the ethical use of said technology is crucial.
 Noting that AI usage in education is not entirely a “bad thing”, they said that integrating it into the curriculum and research could better prepare students for a future where the technology is integrated into jobs.
 Vice-Chancellors’ Council for Private Universities chairman Prof Mushtak Al-Atabi pointed out the paradox of AI in education, highlighting the potential to both simplify and complicate ­academic assessment.
 He also noted how the advancement of AI tools could make the simplicity of copying and pasting assignments more tempting for students.
 “This challenge compels institutions to adopt more human-­centric assessment methods.
 “The future may see students not merely submitting written work but also defending their ideas before panels of experts, ensuring a deeper engagement with their studies and a move away from rote learning.
 “These experts could be drawn from the industry, further enhan­cing the link between academia and real life and improving the employability prospects for students,” he said to The Star.
 Prof Mushtak, who is also the Heriot-Watt University Malaysia provost and CEO, said plagiarism is often not a sign of laziness but a symptom of students failing to see value in their educational journey.
 “They prioritise grades over learning, perhaps because the rele­vance of their studies to the real world is not apparent.
 “The antidote is to cultivate a deep sense of purpose in students and explicitly connect the skills they are learning to the impacts they wish to make in the world,” he said.
 On the flipside, Prof Mushtak said AI could play a transformative role when it comes to educators’ schedules.
 “A significant portion of academic time is consumed by administrative duties, grading, and other tasks that, while necessary, do not directly contribute to inspiring students or enhancing learning.
 “By automating routine tasks, AI can free educators to focus more on mentoring, coaching and truly engaging with their students,” he said.
 Sunway Education Group chief executive officer Prof Datuk Elizabeth Lee said they had ­seve­ral measures in place to mitigate the use of AI. This includes academic staff trained to use ­generative AI in teaching and learning and at the same time detect irresponsible use of it.
 “Clear guidelines are in place for staff and students to iterate expectations on boundaries or limitations towards using ­AI-­gene­rative tools in their formative and summative assessments,” she said.
 Prof Lee, however, added that the group had encouraged the use of AI writing tools since ChatGPT was launched.
 “Students must be taught to understand the limitations and boundaries between fair and unfair AI use,” she said.
 Prof Lee said it isn’t solely about minimising AI use, but instead, preparing students for a future where AI-generative tools become job-integrated.
 “It is also important for us to promote responsible and ethical AI use,” she said, adding that AI can complement and enhance human abilities.
 Prof Lee said the continuous evolution of AI has encou­raged academicians to stay upda­ted and rethink assessments of relevant learning outcomes.
 “We cannot avoid how AI should be seen as a tool for augmenting ability and overcoming challenges.
 “Resisting its usage will further enhance the gap between higher education provision and what students are taught as well as skills on demand in future job markets.
 “Integrating AI into curriculum and research can better prepare our students,” she said.
 Malaysian Association of Pri­vate Colleges and Universities (Mapcu) president Datuk Parmjit Singh said AI writing tools are a positive evolution in technology for education.
 “Incorporating them within the correct ethical utilisation is the way forward as AI tools, just like the scientific calculator in 1972, are here for a positive impact and will coexist with teaching and learning of the future.
 “Banning these would also be pointless due to them being widely available and their seamless integration into word processing programmes,” he said, adding that plagiarism detection tools such as Turnitin or CopyLeaks are helping to keep AI tools in check.",jaya plagiarism detection platform turnitin artificial intelligence detec tion feature finding paper march paper turnitin statement detection feature report turnitin workflow educator percentage document writing tool lar chatgpt gene turnitin consistent presence data continued view writing tool education complex puzzle educator institution factor piece detection discussion student table classroom academic policy essay prompt chief product officer annie chechitelli juncture education technology academic integrity stake education loo resource enable perform technology detection feature advance academic integrity statement turnitin study student generative tool monthly weekly daily survey technology faculty institution generative usage growth revelation tertiary institution student ethical technology crucial usage education bad curriculum prepare student future technology job vice chancellor private university chairman mushtak atabi paradox education potential simplify complicate academic assessment advancement tool simplicity assignment student compels institution human centric assessment method future student idea panel expert deeper engagement study rote learning expert industry enhan link academia real life employability prospect student prof mushtak heriot watt university malaysia provost ceo plagiarism sign laziness symptom student educational journey prioritise grade rele vance study real apparent antidote cultivate deep sense purpose student skill impact mushtak play transformative role educator portion academic time administrative duty task student routine task free educator student sunway education chief executive officer prof datuk lee seve ral measure academic staff generative learning time detect irresponsible guideline staff student expectation boundary limitation gene rative tool formative summative assessment writing tool launched student understand limitation boundary unfair prof student future generative tool job integrated promote responsible ethical complement enhance human ability continuous evolution encou academician rethink assessment relevant outcome avoid tool ability challenge usage enhance gap education provision student taught skill future job market curriculum prepare student malaysian association pri vate college university president datuk parmjit singh writing tool positive evolution technology education correct ethical utilisation tool scientific calculator positive impact coexist learning future pointless seamless integration word processing programme plagiarism detection tool copyleaks tool check,"[(1, 0.7726743), (2, 0.22497992)]",1
673312,Main,15,22/04/2024,AI still cannot surpass human intelligence,,"TECHNOLOGY, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), in the 21st century has reached a point where, many fear, it could eventually replace humans, leading to high unemployment rates, among others. 
 While AI undoubtedly offers new levels of efficiency and innovation to many businesses, human intelligence still possesses a fundamental quality that cannot be replicated. 
 Machines, including AI, are still unable to replicate creativity, the essence of human intelligence. In contrast to algorithms that function according to predetermined parameters, humans have the ability to envision a universe that extends beyond current boundaries, to think creatively, and to generate original ideas. 
 The human mind thrives on innovation and the capacity to envision possibilities that defy conventional wisdom, whether in the form of revolutionary scientific theories, works of literature or other creative endeavours. 
 Artificial intelligence may mimic patterns and produce results based on available data, but it is unable to imitate the spark of inspiration that propels human genius.
 Furthermore, human interaction is infused with emotion, a complex aspect in which comprehension, empathy, and intuition play crucial roles. 
 Proficiency in truly human-centred empathy and connection is essential in fields such as counselling, therapy and caregiving. At this point, AI is unable to fully understand the complexities of human emotions, motives and experiences despite its ability to analyse data and propose answers based on algorithms. 
 Moreover, artificial intelligence will never be able to fully grasp the intricate and subtle art of human connection.
 Other characteristics of human intelligence are resilience and adaptability, which enable people to confront adversity head-on with courage and grace. The capacity to learn, unlearn and relearn is essential in a world that is changing rapidly and where change is the only constant. 
 Humans are cognitively flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions, think quickly and overcome obstacles with sheer determination and resourcefulness. 
 AI excels in jobs with clear specifications, but it is less effective in unstructured settings with significant ambiguity and uncertainty. 
 Let us remember that AI is not a replacement for the special traits that make us fundamentally human, including the ability to dream, empathise and to flourish in the face of difficulty as we embrace its revolutionary promises. 
 Human intelligence will always be in demand in many industries while AI serves as a tool that can help us achieve our goals. DR FAIZ MASNAN

673070,Lifestyle,21,21/04/2024,AI influencers       shake up  social media,"AI-generated influencers are gaining traction on social media, presenting both opportunities and challenges in the evolving realm of digital marketing.","SOCIAL media influencers have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) to spice up their content, but they are also facing growing competition from AI-generated Instagramers, TikTokers and YouTubers.
 Sporting pink hair and posing in lingerie, swimsuits or gym outfits, Aitana Lopez has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram, where she is described as a “gamer at heart” and “fitness lover” – except she’s not real.Aitana was created by The Clueless, a Barcelona-based company that describes itself as an “AI modelling agency” run by “visionaries on a mission to redefine the world of influencers”.
 Sofia Novales, project manager at The Clueless, said the “rising costs associated with human influencers” were a reason behind the company’s creation.
 “Virtual models, being digital, present a more economical alternative,” Novales said.
 Another plus: total control over content.
 “The advantages lie in unparalleled creative control, allowing seamless decision-making on image, fashion, and aesthetics without the need for physical photoshoots,” Novales said.
 The rise of AI has fuelled concerns about the proliferation of deepfake videos that could be used maliciously.
 Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it would start putting “Made with AI labels” on AI-generated content in May.
 AI presents a huge business opportunity for content creators: The influencer market is expected to grow rapidly, from US$16.5bil (RM78.44bil) in 2022 to nearly US$200bil (RM950.8bil) by 2032, according to Allied Market Research.Younger audience
 Using virtual influencers is not new: Barbie already has millions of followers on Instagram.
 But they are now being used in advertisements where they can’t be told apart from a real person.
 Take Lil Miquela, a “19-year-old robot living in LA” created by a California agency in 2016.
 With 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 3.5 million on TikTok, Lil Maqueta has promoted brands as big as BMW.The idea was to “create something never seen before”, the German premium carmaker said in a statement.
 “Attracting a younger,  technology-savvy generation is for us the icing on the cake,” it said.
 Maud Lejeune, who heads up the Paris-based digital strategy agency AD Crew, said that it isn’t difficult for the public to accept AI influencers.
 “It’s like actors on TV: we know it isn’t real, yet we follow them and we find it interesting, it’s like watching a mini-series.”
 AD Crew represents more than 30 influencers, but Lejeune created her own virtual influencer, Metagaya, two years ago.
 “The current level of design didn’t exist then. It’s technical, you’ve got to dress them, take photos for the background, create a story,” said Lejeune, acknowledging that Metagaya didn’t turn out very well.
 The rapid technological progress brought by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora video generator could make it easier to create and operate realistic virtual influencers.
 Aided by AI
 Human influencers are also seizing on AI technology to make better videos.
 France’s Charles Sterlings sees an opportunity to improve translations.
 He uses different tools on platforms like HeyGen and Rask.ai to automatically translate and lip-sync his video posts into English and Spanish.
 Sterlings also uses Deepshot, a platform that allows users to create deepfakes by changing the words and mouth movements of people in real videos.
 He said it took him just a few minutes and a few dollars to manipulate a video of French President Emmanuel Macron.
 But Sterlings sees the technology as a competitor as well as a useful tool.
 “Anyone with a phone can be an influencer. But eventually, it will be artificial intelligence, available 24 hours a day, and much cheaper to develop,” he said.
 For Maud Lejeune, AI can help influencers produce more content.
 “It’s tough to put yourself in front of the camera for a long time, and certain creators burn out... Maybe AI will provide a new way to create without exposing oneself,” she said.
 The Clueless has no qualms about its AI models taking away business from real influencers.
 “We don’t foresee real models becoming obsolete or replaced by AI-generated models like Aitana,” said Novales. “In our view, they can coexist as another competition in the industry.” – AFP",social medium influencers artificial intelligence spice content competition instagramers tiktokers youtubers pink hair lingerie swimsuit outfit lopez follower gamer heart fitness real aitana clueless barcelona company agency visionary redefine influencers novales project manager clueless cost human influencers reason company creation virtual model digital economical alternative novales total control content advantage unparalleled creative control seamless decision image fashion aesthetic physical photoshoots novales concern proliferation video owner facebook instagram start label content huge business opportunity content creator market bil bil bil bil market audience virtual influencers million follower advertisement real person lil miquela robot california agency follower tiktok lil maqueta brand bmw idea create german premium carmaker statement technology savvy generation cake maud head paris digital strategy agency crew difficult public accept influencers actor real follow mini series crew influencers virtual influencer metagaya current level design technical dress photo create story lejeune metagaya rapid technological progress like sora video generator easier create operate realistic virtual influencers human influencers technology video france charles sterling opportunity translation tool platform rask translate lip sync video english spanish sterling deepshot platform user deepfakes mouth movement people real video minute dollar video french president macron sterling technology competitor tool phone influencer artificial intelligence hour day cheaper develop maud lejeune influencers content tough front camera time creator create clueless qualm model business real influencers real model generated model novales coexist competition industry afp,"[(1, 0.24806347), (2, 0.74858254)]",2

671894,StarBiz,13,18/04/2024,Ernie Bot helps Chinese tech giant Baidu double down on AI push,,"SHENZHEN: Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc says its large language model and ChatGPT-like chatbot, Ernie Bot, has garnered more than 200 million users since its debut in March 2023.
 The company said it is ramping up efforts to bolster the commercial application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
 On Tuesday, Baidu showcased a suite of AI models and development toolkits to empower individuals with accessible and easy-to-use tools to create AI applications at the Create 2024 Baidu AI Developer Conference in Shenzhen, Guangdong.
 Robin Li, co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Baidu, said at the event that the Ernie LLM has now emerged as China’s leading AI foundation model with the broadest range of applications.
 LLMs refer to AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation.
 Li said the Ernie model has achieved an obvious upgrade with improved performance in code generation, code interpretation, and code optimisation in recent months, and its capabilities have reached a world-leading level.
 The inference performance of the Ernie model has improved by 105 times compared with the one launched last March, and its inference cost has been reduced to only 1% of the previous version, he said.
 Furthermore, more than 85,000 enterprise clients have used Baidu’s enterprise-level LLM platform, Qianfan, to create 190,000 AI applications.
 “AI is catalysing a revolution in creativity. In the future, developing an AI application will be as straightforward as creating a short video. Everyone can be a developer and create,” Li said.
 Li also said multimodal LLMs that integrate different types of content like text, images, speech and video into AI models are key to the future development of AI.
 This approach has been largely regarded as essential for realising artificial general intelligence, which is a theoretical AI system with capabilities that rival those of a human, Li said.
 Charlie Dai, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester, a research firm, said that as one of the leaders in the AI software market in China, Baidu has made substantial progress in the technological evolution of foundation models, which are becoming critical for next-generation AI applications.
 He added that the company was expanding its business ecosystem of generative AI technology.
 At the event, Li also noted that “the most significant use for large visual models is in autonomous driving systems”.
 Baidu’s goal is not just about teaching AI to create video but also about enabling AI to comprehend real-world dynamics and predict future events, which are critical for driving autonomously.
 He said the company has utilised extensive data from over 100 million kilometres of testing on complex city roads in China to develop the visual model for its autonomous driving platform, Apollo.
 The multimodal LLM is an undeniable future development direction for generative AI technology, said Lu Yanxia, research director at market consultancy IDC China.
 She added that the LLMs necessitate a higher demand for data and knowledge in professional fields and for talent that can fine-tune specialised models based on diverse industrial demands.
 Lu said Chinese tech companies should pool more resources into improving computing power, algorithms and the quality of data to gain a competitive edge in the global AI chatbot race.

671712,Main,3,17/04/2024,AI security systems can help identify potential threats,,"PETALING JAYA: Improving airport security through a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), enhanced security measures and staff training is key to preventing future untoward incidents at airports, say experts.
 This comes after a shooting incident at the Kuala Lumpur  International Airport (KLIA).
 Criminologist Datuk Dr P. Sundramoorthy suggested implementing AI into scanning devices to allow for better identification of potential threats before they even enter the airport.
 “AI can help scanners distinguish potential threats, such as guns and knives, as machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognise specific patterns and signatures of dangerous objects, reducing the reliance on manual screening.”
 Sundramoorthy, who is with Universiti Sains Malaysia’s Centre for Policy Research, added that combining AI with enhanced scanning devices, like advanced X-ray machines and explosive detection systems, would help security personnel better identify hidden threats.
 “Having scanners and officers at all airport entry points would be a feasible option but requires significant financial investments and increased manpower.
 “While it can significantly enhance security, it also needs to be balanced with cost-effectiveness and passenger convenience,” he added.
 Crime analyst Kamal Affandi Hashim said incorporating AI into enhanced CCTV systems to detect suspicious behaviour would be key to preventing untoward incidents.
 “AI can be trained to detect suspicious behaviour in the crowd, that will then be automatically flagged to allow for quick predictive policing,” he said.
 He added that increasing the presence of security personnel along with the use of weapon-­detecting trained dogs on patrols at airports would be a good supportive measure.
 Criminologist Dr Zalmizy Hussin had a similar idea, adding that AI-enhanced CCTV systems could be integrated with existing scanner and access control systems to be more comprehensive.
 “By analysing real-time video feeds and combining them with scanner data, AI can provide a more holistic approach to threat detection and prevention by basically automating most of the threat detection process.
 “These integrated security systems, that connect various security technologies and databases, will allow for real-time monitoring, data analysis and coordinated response to security incidents.
 “In addition to increasing airport security efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, it also improves the overall passenger experience by reducing waiting times and increasing operational efficiency,” the senior lecturer at Universiti Utara Malaysia said.
  Dr Zalmizy added that providing in-depth behavioural analysis training for police officers would also be key to supporting such AI security systems.
 “These personnel should receive regular training on threat assessment, behavioural analysis, and response protocols to enhance their ability to identify and respond to security threats.
 “Combined with public awareness campaigns on airport security measures and the importance of reporting suspicious behaviour, educate passengers on security protocols and encourage their active participation to serve as an additional layer of defence for airport security,” he said.",jaya airport security combination artificial intelligence security measure staff training key future untoward incident airport expert incident kuala international airport klia datuk sundramoorthy device potential threat airport scanner distinguish potential threat knife machine algorithm recognise specific dangerous object reliance manual screening sundramoorthy universiti sains malaysia centre policy device advanced ray machine explosive detection system security personnel hidden threat scanner officer entry feasible option financial investment manpower enhance security cost effectiveness passenger convenience crime analyst kamal affandi hashim cctv system suspicious behaviour key untoward incident suspicious behaviour crowd quick predictive presence security personnel trained dog patrol airport supportive measure criminologist zalmizy hussin idea cctv system scanner access control system real time video feed scanner data holistic approach threat detection prevention threat detection process integrated security system security technology real time data analysis response security incident addition airport security efficiency accuracy cost effectiveness passenger experience time operational efficiency senior lecturer universiti utara malaysia zalmizy depth behavioural analysis training police officer security system personnel regular training threat assessment behavioural analysis response enhance ability respond security threat public awareness campaign security measure suspicious behaviour educate passenger security encourage active participation additional layer defence airport security,"[(2, 0.99542177)]",2
671440,StarBiz,8,16/04/2024,SNS poised to benefit from  AI and growth  of data centres,,"PETALING JAYA: SNS Network Technology Bhd’s robust financial performance is expected to be supported by new artificial intelligence (AI) server sales and continued growth in its existing information communication technology (ICT) business. 
 According to Rakuten Trade Research, growth in the group’s ICT business will be backed by consumer-device refresh cycles and ongoing digital transformation in education and commerce. 
 The research house also noted that SNS serves as a crucial link between server manufacturers and buyers, facilitating AI adoption and integration.
 “Recognising the potential of AI across various sectors in Malaysia, SNS positions itself as a facilitator of AI adoption. 
 “Acting as a liaison between server manufacturers and buyers, SNS plays a pivotal role in enabling AI integration in Malaysia,” the research firm said in a report. 
 Moreover, SNS excels in other segments such as data centre fit-out, testing, commissioning and operations management, though it is not directly involved in construction. 
 “By offering a comprehensive suite of services, including cloud computing, data analytics and AI workload optimisation, SNS addresses diverse business needs. 
 “Its recent partnership with Supermicro aligns well with Supermicro’s expansion plans in Johor, further solidifying SNS’  position in the market,” Rakuten Trade Research said. 
 The research house added that the country is now an attractive destination for data centre investments, supported by favourable conditions, including an abundance of land and power resources, excellent international connectivity and supportive government policies. 
 “A report from real estate company Juwai IQI highlights Malaysia as the fastest-growing market, projecting a remarkable 600% growth in AI-driven data centre expansion over the next five years,” Rakuten Trade Research said.
 The research house said that Malaysia currently hosts over 40 operational data centres, each with capacities ranging from 100 megawatts (MW) to 150MW. 
 Driven by low land and energy costs, upcoming data centre projects indicate an anticipated additional capacity of 1,400MW over the next five to 10 years. 
 “Considering that each graphics processing unit (GPU) server can only support 10 kilowatt of data centre usage, the potential for SNS to seize opportunities in this expanding market is significant,” the research outfit said. 
 With an average selling price per unit of RM1.5mil for servers and a gross profit margin of 15%, Rakuten Trade Research said the company anticipates robust revenue generation. 
 As of the fourth quarter of its financial year 2024 (4Q24), SNS sold 21 units of AI servers, with a target to sell 300 units in FY25.
 The research house maintained a “buy” call on SNS with a target price of 54 sen based on FY25 price-earnings multiple of 15 times, in line with industry peers.
 The research house anticipates the support and resistance level of the share price to be at 33 sen and 43 sen, respectively. 
 “We expect the company’s FY24 to FY27 earnings to grow at a robust compound annual growth rate of 39%.

670896,Lifestyle,5,15/04/2024,"Robots, drones and AI enter the arena",The fusion of sports and technology is crafting the playing fields of the future.,"THE lines between sports and technology are increasingly blurring, with recent developments bringing the two fields closer than ever before. 
 While esports and sports video games have long been a point of intersection, it’s the latest technological advancements that are having an impact on traditional sports and even leading to the creation of new ones.
 This fusion stems from people who ask unconventional questions, such as what would happen if a team of robots could play football? 
 Their curiosity has led to explorations beyond the ordinary, challenging the limits of what’s possible in sports and technology alike.Robot rivalries
 While artificial intelligence is currently at the forefront of tech trends, it may come as a surprise to many that the journey of teaching AI-powered robots to play football began as early as 1996.The RoboCup (short for the Robot World Cup Initiative) is an annual event that features autonomous robot teams facing off in football matches, operating completely independently without human intervention.
 Participants in the RoboCup span several leagues: in the middle size league, teams field five custom-designed robots, while the small size league mirrors a full football squad with 11 robotic players on each team.
 Additionally, RoboCup includes a standard platform league and a humanoid league, which is further segmented into kid-size and adult-size robot categories.
 Each team designs and builds all robots for the RoboCup in accordance with the competition’s specifications. However, the standard platform league uses a predesigned robot to determine which team has the smartest software.
 In addition to showcasing football-playing robots, the upcoming edition of RoboCup in July will also feature competitions for autonomous rescue robots, industrial robotics, and robots designed to assist with household tasks.The autonomous rescue robots will compete in emergency response scenarios that are too hazardous for humans. The finals will include a search and identification mission involving simulated victims.
 Household assistant robots will compete in one of three categories: general household tasks, social interactions, or an open category where researchers have more freedom to decide on their submission.
 For those in search of more adrenaline-fueled excitement, there is Drone Soccer, which first kicked off in South Korea. True to its name, Drone Soccer involves teams of drones controlled by humans – five players per team – engaging in a game of aerial football, unlike the autonomous robots of RoboCup.
 Premiered at CES 2024, Drone Soccer, inspired by the magical game of Quidditch from the Harry Potter universe, showcased drones ramming into each other as they tried to stop opponents from scoring goals in intense three-minute matches.
 Each team is divided into three defenders guarding their goal, one striker – the only drone designated to score – and a forward who jumps into the striker’s role in case of damage or a crash.
 Points are earned by skilfully guiding the striker drone through the goal hoop, a task that requires careful navigation – especially when considering these drones can fly at speeds of up to 80kph and the 60cm hoop is positioned 3.5m above the ground.
 The inaugural professional league for Drone Soccer was established just last year, setting the stage for the sport’s first World Cup event, which is scheduled to take place in South Korea in October 2025.
 Electrifying excitement
 A motorsport grounded in technology is Formula E, which is akin to Formula One but exclusively features electric vehicles (EVs). 
 Operating under the same governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it is sanctioned as an FIA World Championship alongside Formula One.The FIA touts Formula E as the first certified carbon-neutral sport, and automakers use it as a proving ground for innovative EV technologies.
 For example, Nissan’s website attributes the improved power management in its consumer vehicles to advances made in battery efficiency within Formula E.
 Similarly, Maserati leveraged data from Formula E to refine the software in its connected electric vehicles. 
 Formula E races occur on street circuits around the globe, in cities such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, Berlin, Jakarta, and previously in Putrajaya during 2015.In early March, it was reported that Malaysia received an offer to host the 2025 Formula E-Prix Grand Finale in Kuala Lumpur as an annual event that will continue until 2030.
 The local partner involved said they are anticipating a decision from the Prime Minister’s Office.

  as a showcase for the latest innovations in assistive tech.
 Slated for October 2024, the Cybathlon will feature eight disciplines, including the arm prosthesis race, assistive robot race, vision assistance race, brain- computer interface race, exoskeleton race, functional electrical stimulation bike race, leg prosthesis race, and wheelchair race.Meanwhile, the cycling world, which experienced significant disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, also saw the emergence of virtual road racing events pioneered by the International Cyclists Union (UCI), the sport’s governing body.The UCI Cycling Esports World Championship invites cyclists to compete on smart trainers that capture data, such as pedal power, and interface with a virtual training app. Previous iterations used the Zwift app, but from 2024, the UCI has transitioned to the MyWhoosh app, both of which place racers on a virtual track alongside the other competitors for the event.At this year’s competition, 80% of the slots will be reserved for representatives from national cycling federations, with the remaining 20% open to public qualifiers conducted on the MyWhoosh platform.",line sport technology development field closer esports sport video game technological advancement impact traditional sport creation fusion people unconventional question team robot football curiosity exploration ordinary limit sport technology robot rivalry artificial intelligence forefront tech trend journey teaching robot football robocup short robot cup initiative annual event feature autonomous robot team football match human intervention participant span league middle size league team field custom robot size league mirror football robotic player robocup standard platform league humanoid league kid size adult size robot category design build robot competition specification platform league robot determine team smartest software addition football robot edition robocup july feature competition autonomous rescue robot industrial robotics robot assist household task autonomous rescue robot emergency response scenario hazardous human final identification mission victim household assistant robot category task social interaction category researcher decide submission search adrenaline excitement drone soccer south korea true drone soccer team drone human player game aerial football autonomous robot premiered ce drone soccer magical game quidditch harry potter universe drone opponent goal intense minute match team defender goal striker drone forward jump striker role damage crash striker drone goal hoop task careful navigation drone speed hoop inaugural professional league drone soccer stage sport cup event korea excitement motorsport technology formula akin formula electric vehicle body international automobile federation fia fia championship formula fia tout carbon neutral sport automaker ground innovative technology website attribute power management consumer vehicle advance maserati data formula refine software electric vehicle race street circuit globe city kong tokyo berlin jakarta march malaysia offer host formula prix grand finale kuala lumpur annual event local partner decision prime minister office machine cybathlon mirror olympic style competition distinct difference focus assistive technology everyday event swiss federal institute technology zurich zurich public university stage disabled athlete innovation assistive tech october cybathlon feature arm prosthesis race assistive robot race vision assistance race brain computer interface race exoskeleton race functional electrical stimulation bike race leg prosthesis race wheelchair race cycling disruption pandemic emergence virtual road event international cyclist union uci sport body uci cycling esports championship cyclist smart trainer data pedal power virtual training previous iteration app uci mywhoosh app racer virtual track alongside competitor event competition slot representative national cycling federation public qualifier mywhoosh,"[(2, 0.26887333), (3, 0.6831269), (4, 0.04637577)]",3
671094,StarBiz,10,15/04/2024,"Race for AI  isn’t zero-sum,  says Amazon cloud boss",,"San Francisco: As Google races with Microsoft and OpenAI to create world-changing generative artificial intelligence (AI), some critics see Amazon as lagging behind.
 “I respectfully disagree” with that viewpoint, said Adam Selipsky, Amazon’s cloud chief, in an interview with AFP.
 Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta have made headlines talking about their own foundational models, or those of their close partners, that are key to AI and its ability to produce written works, images, videos or even computer code from simple user prompts.
 But “there is simply not going to be one model to rule them all,” argued Selipsky.
 AWS, Amazon’s industry-leading cloud branch, is already seeing customers “needing multiple models for multiple different use cases”, he explained.
 He cited the capabilities of various AI models available on the AWS Bedrock platform, such as Meta’s Llama and Claude from Anthropic, as well as some from Mistral in France and Amazon’s own Titan brand.
 Generative AI is regarded in Silicon Valley as poised to revolutionise the way people get jobs done.
 And cloud computing companies, which have massive computing power, troves of data and AI expertise, now host generative AI models. They are in a prime position to capitalise on the new technology – but they have a lot to lose if they don’t cough up the latest innovations.
 A pioneer of eCommerce, Amazon also dominates the cloud. AWS had 31% of the cloud computing market at the end of 2023, according to Stocklytics.
 But rivals Microsoft and Google are gaining ground with their cloud businesses, with 24% and 11% market share, respectively.
 Thanks to a US$13bil investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Microsoft is “in the driver’s seat” of an ongoing cloud revolution, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
 Microsoft and Google compete with their in-house, AI-infused digital assistants to help with creating content – emails, presentations, ads – and applications (especially chatbots).
 AWS is less known to the public and its digital assistant Alexa is not yet as conversational as ChatGPT.
 But Amazon has been in the AI business for more than 25 years, said Selipsky. “If you go back to personalisation on the retail website in 1998 – we called it personalisation, but it was AI.”
 The Seattle firm has long had thousands of people working on the technology and has pivoted some of them to the new frontier of generative AI, Selipsky said.
 “We’ve moved rapidly on new generations of our (AI) chips like Trainium, and building Amazon Bedrock, and getting it adopted quickly and coming out with exciting applications on top of the models, like Amazon Q”, an AI assistant, he said.
 Selipsky, who took command of AWS in 2021, replacing Andy Jassy, who stepped into the chief executive role vacated by founder Jeff Bezos, was confident Amazon would remain a leader in cloud computing.
 As proof, he points to AWS customers and partners, including Nvidia.
 The high-profile chipmaker recently announced it is building a “supercomputer” on AWS using Nvidia’s own high-performing processors, the ultrasophisticated and coveted GPUs.
 Most notably, Amazon has invested US$4bil in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival that is also backed by Google. The start-up will use AWS and its Trainium chips to build AI models and help “improve our technology”, said Selipsky. — AFP",san francisco google race openai create generative artificial intelligence critic disagree viewpoint adam selipsky amazon cloud chief interview afp tech giant microsoft google meta headline foundational model close partner key ability image computer code simple user prompt rule selipsky aws industry cloud branch customer multiple model multiple capability model bedrock platform meta llama claude anthropic mistral france amazon titan brand generative silicon valley revolutionise people job company power trove data expertise host generative model prime position capitalise technology lot lose cough innovation ecommerce amazon cloud aws market stocklytics rival google gaining ground cloud business market share bil investment chatgpt maker microsoft seat cloud revolution wedbush analyst dan microsoft google house digital assistant content email presentation ad application chatbots public digital assistant conversational chatgpt amazon business selipsky personalisation retail website personalisation seattle firm thousand people technology generative selipsky generation chip trainium building amazon bedrock exciting application top model assistant selipsky command andy jassy chief executive role founder jeff bezos confident amazon remain leader cloud proof aws customer partner nvidia profile chipmaker building supercomputer nvidia processor coveted gpus bil anthropic openai rival google start trainium chip model technology selipsky afp,"[(3, 0.7993209), (6, 0.19655536)]",3
670754,Main,6,14/04/2024,Wong to share views on AI and media at int’l forum,‘Healthier food choices and eating earlier promote longevity’,"KUALA LUMPUR: Media personality Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai has been invited by China Media Group (CMG), one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world, to participate in an international forum on artificial intelligence and the media.
 The Bernama chairman and Star Media Group adviser will share his views on how the media can balance the effectiveness of AI as a platform and use it responsibly.
 “We need to embrace AI as it will bring a lot of benefits to our job as media practitioners. We can focus on the more important tasks and use AI as a tool to alle­viate tedious tasks.
 “For example, AI tools can help streamline time-consuming processes and laborious tasks. This will allow us to focus on revenue,  content and creativity,’’ he said.
 The three-day forum “Force of Good: A Shared Responsibility’’ will bring global journalists, aca­demicians and experts from relevant fields to exchange ideas and views in Beijing from April 28.
 CMG operates a vast broadcas­ting network, comprising 51 television channels including nine  international channels and 22 radio frequencies targeting domes­tic audiences as well as programming in 80 languages for its global audience.
 The group’s major outlets are China Central Television (CCTV), China Radio International (CRI) and China Global Television Network which offers English, French, Arabic and Russian TV channels.
 Wong regarded himself as a content creator but not an AI specialist, so he hoped to learn and upskill himself in this area from his peers and experts in AI.
 The veteran journalist, how­ever, said that he would be presenting a video where AI would be used to enable him to speak in Chinese to the audience.
 “Unlike the past, where voices are dubbed and the speaker looks artificial and awkward, AI is able to help me look proficient, professional and articulate in the video even though I cannot speak much Mandarin,’’ he said.
 The same video, he said, can be used, via AI, for any other languages which would help reach a wider global audience.
 The video, he said, was created by Bernama, the Malaysian natio­nal news agency, and Huawei Malaysia, a leading global provi­der of information and communications technology.
 Wong said he would also be talking on the importance of embracing AI and the forum in several scheduled TV interviews by CCTV in English and Bahasa Malaysia.

670684,Main,15,14/04/2024,Is AI pushing boundaries or killing creativity?,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence’s integration in the arts and creative industries is sparking debates on ethics and innovation and challenging traditional artistic boundaries.
 When the fifth and final instalment of the Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny, was released in 2023, it sparked a humorous exchange between generations. 
 A millennial expressed interest in seeing the latest instalment but was met by a father’s bemused response: “Which Indiana Jones movie are you going to watch?”, emphasising the film franchise’s long history.
 This bewilderment was warranted. In the opening scenes of the 2023 movie, audiences meet a noticeably younger version of main actor Harrison Ford, reminiscent of his appearance in the 1980s films.
 This deageing effect was made possible by visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). 
 The creators claimed they didn’t rely solely on AI or machine learning but instead used a comprehensive VFX tool called “ILM FaceSwap” alongside the expertise of more than 100 visual effects artists -- yet questions remain about the growing use of AI in filmmaking.
 It’s possible that the latest advances in AI technology could mean those visual effects artists may be made redundant in the not-too distant future. 
 ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unveiled the first short films created using its new video AI tool Sora, with filmmakers describing the creations as “totally  surreal”.
 Early clips generated using the AI software show how it could take a simple written prompt and turn it into a realistic video of the scenario.
 AI technology is remarkable. But there are concerns about its benefits and ethical implications, and how it can sometimes raise eyebrows. 
 AI is both a collaborator pushing the boundaries of artistic expression as well as seen as a potential threat to artists sometimes. The use of AI in film and television has been a contentious topic since last year’s Hollywood strikes, where writers and actors expressed anxiety about their future in the industry.
 AI has the potential to revolutionise filmmaking by creating scripts and generating visuals. However, challenges include audience acceptance, legal uncertainties surrounding copyright, and the ethical implications of AI dominance in creative industries will still plague its use. We might even see deceased movie legends gracing the silver screens soon enough.
 Despite advancements, AI has its limitations. Unlike AI, artists can draw on real-life experiences and challenge people to see complexities, identifying and confronting biases within the arts and other media forms.
 The ethical and philosophical challenges of AI extend beyond aesthetics. The recent controversy surrounding the British royal family’s poorly edited photo and questions about the authenticity of Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton’s cancer announcement video highlights these  concerns.
 The creation of sexualised deepfakes without consent, often targeting women and leaving them with lasting trauma, poses significant ethical and legal challenges, prompting a re-evaluation of existing laws and responses.
 AI’s influence across these creative industries necessitates ongoing discussions to ensure responsible development and a future where human creativity and technological innovation can work cohesively. – 360info

670662,Main,31,14/04/2024,Meta turns to AI to protect minors,Social media giant says it is testing ‘nudity protection tool’ to blur explicit images,"Paris: Meta said it is developing new tools to protect teenage users from “sextortion” scams on its Instagram platform, which has been accused by politicians in the United States of damaging the mental health of youngsters.Gangs run sextortion scams by persuading people to provide explicit images of themselves and then threatening to release them to the public unless they receive money.Meta said it is testing a “nudity protection” tool that would find and blur images containing nudity that were sent to minors on the app’s messaging system.
 “This way, the recipient is not exposed to unwanted intimate content and has the choice to see the image or not,” Capucine Tuf-fier, who is in charge of child protection at Meta France, said on Thursday.
 The US company said it would also offer advice and safety tips to anyone sending or receiving such messages.
 Some 3,000 young people fell victim to sexploitation scams in 2022 in the US, according to the authorities there.Separately, more than 40 US states began suing Meta in October in a case that accuses the company of having “profited from children’s pain”.The legal filing alleged Meta had exploited young users by creating a business model designed to maximise time they spend on the platform despite harm to their health.
 Meta announced in January it would roll out measures to protect under-18s that included tightening content restrictions and boosting parental supervision tools.
 The firm said on Thursday that the latest tools were building on “our long-standing work to help protect young people from unwanted or potentially harmful contact”.
 “We’re testing new features to help protect young people from sextortion and intimate image abuse and to make it more difficult for potential scammers and criminals to find and interact with teens,” the company said.
 It added that the “nudity protection” tool used “on-device machine learning”, a kind of artificial intelligence, to analyse images.The firm, which is also constantly accused of violating the data privacy of its users, stressed that it would not have access to the images unless users reported them.
 Meta said it would also use AI tools to identify accounts sending offending material and severely restrict their ability to interact with young users on the platform.

670802,StarEdu,3,14/04/2024,"Adding value with AI, digital tech",,"A SIGNIFICANT shift is underway in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with a strong focus on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in finance roles, highlighting the necessity for professionals to adapt and embrace new skills.
 According to the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) latest annual Global Talent Trends Survey 2024, 78% of respondents believe AI will enable finance professionals to add more value to what they do, while 54% believe they are not developing the skills needed for the future workplace.
 “Across APAC, we’re witnessing a transformative phase where AI and digital technologies are not just tools but essential elements that redefine the value finance professionals bring to the table.
 “It’s a compelling and exciting call to action for organisations, individuals and future professional talent to leverage these technologies, enhancing analytical capabilities and strategic insights,” said ACCA (Asia Pacific) director Pulkit Abrol.
 This wake-up call comes in the biggest global talent survey across the accountancy profession, providing a view of howpeople feel about their life at work.
 Almost 10,000 professional accountants from 157 countries including Malaysia were asked about the concerns they held around future work and aspirations for their careers. 
 A spotlight was also cast on the in-demand soft skills that are pivotal in the current climate. Communication, problem-solving, adaptability, and initiative were identified as the core competencies employers in APAC eagerly seek. These skills complement the technical expertise in finance, enabling professionals to navigate the complexities of the modern business environment effectively.The annual survey of finance professionals also emphasised the importance of continuous learning and development, encouraging professionals in APAC to engage in lifelong education to remain competitive.
 “The landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and staying ahead means being proactive about learning and personal development. 
 “ACCA is committed to supporting our community of members and future members through this journey, providing resources and platforms to enhance their skills and confidently embrace the future,” said Abrol.
 The survey, which also assessed key workplace issues such as hybrid working, diversity, mobility and mental health and the cost-of-living crisis, revealed that 73% pointed to a strong diversity and inclusion culture as a key factor in deciding to work at an organisation, as the talent crunch continues with over half expecting to move on in their career. 
 While hybrid working, a mix of office- and home-based working, is slowly gaining traction, big mismatches remain between what employees want and what employers demand. 
 A whopping 76% of all employees surveyed said it’s their preferred arrangement but in Malaysia, only 43% are in hybrid working arrangements while 54% are in the office full time.
 Within the APAC market, a staggering 58% of professionals are seeking a pay rise this year, reflecting the growing concern over compensation amid global economic strains. However, half of those surveyed believe that transitioning to a new organisation is necessary to achieve their financial goals.

670514,StarExtra,4,13/04/2024,Injecting AI into dialogue dynamics,Tech demos show the potential of AI-powered characters and conversational gameplay in which players try to talk their way to their goals.,"GLIMPSES of the future often emerge at the Game Developers Conference. It’s where indie games generate a buzz or the kernel of a big idea is planted.
 This year, artificial intelligence (AI) took centre stage as Nvidia showed off the jaw-dropping capabilities of its chipsets and software companies such as Convai and Ubisoft revealed intriguing gameplay opportunities.
 AI has been the source of hype and fear over the past year. It’s been at the centre of labour conflict in Hollywood, while in the tech industry, companies see it as a way to improve efficiency.
 In the primordial tech ooze of video games, AI is set up to have a transformative impact on one part of the industry.
 Enter Convai
 Convai, a company that creates AI developer tools, offered a firsthand look at three projects. One was Second Life, where representatives showed how AI bots could act as guides for novice players.
 In a massively multiplayer online game, the non-playable characters act almost like concierges with more agency.
 Players can ask them about locations, and they can teleport them to new locales. They can generate surfboards on command, so they can hang ten on a virtual beach. What’s notable is that the AI can not only answer questions but also know the environment around it.
 The bot even has long-term memory so that it can recall places that players visited.
 This raises privacy issues, but Convai said each bot has its own speaker profile, and there’s no mixing of memories. Developers can also limit the memory by time so that it will forget.
 Stormgate is an upcoming real-time strategy game from Frost Giant Studio, and in that demo, a character named Dr Fletcher offered me a sitrep about what’s happening on the battlefield.
 This demo wouldn’t be in the game, but I could ask the NPC about the world, and she would offer hints into the lore.
 Project Neural Nexus 
 By far the most impressive demo was Project Neural Nexus. It takes place in a cyberpunk world and throws players into a situation where a woman named Seraph has to guide players to the roof.
 That would be a normal scene in a video game that transitions to a bigger fight, but while wandering through the world, Convai officials urged me to talk with the inhabitants.
 I chatted with them as I walked to the objective, learning more about the world, but I wanted to have a little more fun with it, so I asked one character if I could borrow some money, and they responded without a hiccup, berating me.
 Later in the demo, Seraph handed me a gun, and I asked what kind of weapon it was (it’s hard to tell with futuristic sci-fi weapons) and she told me it was a submachine gun. It showed the characters also knew about objects in the world as well as the general setting.
 Curious about her long hair, I asked where she got it cut, and she told me she didn’t have time to have her hair done while fighting the enemy.
 The most interesting conversation I had was with Mae “Shadow” Liang. This masked character was bragging about how she wasn’t bound by any law and that, as an assassin, she could do whatever she wanted. 
 I brought up the Geneva Conventions and asked if they applied to her trade, thinking she wouldn’t know anything about them. To my surprise, she responded and gave a shockingly interesting answer.
 The other fascinating interaction involved a robot named Wendy. I spoke with it, and the robot was aggressively hostile toward me. Taking offence, I criticised it and the robot shot back at me for one more memorable conversation.
 It was strange how an NPC could elicit such a strong reaction from a simple conversation. It just deepened the believability.
 Nvidia’s demo
 I had a similar experience at the Nvidia demo called Covert Protocol, which featured Inworld AI technology. In this situation, I had to gain access to the room of NexaLife’s chief technology officer (CTO). I went in knowing nothing, and I had to talk my way to gaining information.
 I started with the doorman, Tae, who I learned was also an aspiring comedian. I asked him to tell a joke, and it was a bit tepid, but he did guide me to the reception, Sophia.
 With Sophia, I straight up tried to ask her for the CTO’s room number, but she rejected me, citing Wavre Hotels’ policy that protected clients’ privacy.
 I asked her where I could get a drink, and she directed me to the bar right across from her. Again, these AI-driven NPCs are aware of the items in the room as well as what’s around them.
 I ran into Diego Martinez, who was also a Nexalife executive, but he was under strain having to write a keynote speech. I asked him about his colleague’s room number, but he wasn’t having any of it. He came off as standoffish, so I lied to him and told him I was the police and needed that information.
 Interestingly, he didn’t budge and was even more sarcastic and gruff. The demo ended in failure, but it had a different feel from the Convai one. It felt more focused, and I had to peel away at the right responses.I couldn’t go back and talk to him again because, like in the Convai demo, Diego would remember me and what I said.
 In developers’ hands
 Lastly, I experienced what AI technology could do in the hands of a video game company. Ubisoft offered a demo featuring their Neo NPCs. It takes place in another future dystopic world, and players meet with a member of the resistance named Bloom.
 Virginie Mosser, the Ubisoft narrative director, called the experience conversational gameplay. Unlike the previous demos, this one was more guided, as players had objectives they had to accomplish to build trust with the Neo NPC.
 Players have to look for openings in the back and forth and use those to find out more about the world and Bloom, my fellow resistance fighter.
 When I asked him why he wanted to fight the megacorporations, he mentioned that he had a son, so I asked about his name. He said the child was named Evrand. That effort increased the trust level between us, and at the same time, a robot beside us commented on my interviewing prowess.
 The chat between me and the NPC showed how players will have to figure out ways to artfully bring up subjects and investigate the character in front of them.
 I learned that Bloom was non-violent and a generally positive person. If I went beyond the boundaries and asked a random question, the AI would steer the conversation to be on mission in a subtle way.
 During one of the more surreal answers, Mosser said the Neo NPC was hallucinating. Sometimes, when a question pierces the knowledge base, they come up with vague answers that sometimes sound normal.
 Planning a heist
 The other part of the demo introduced me to Iron. She’s a female leader of the resistance and asks for my opinion on a mission to break into a villa and steal some files. Around the front yard, there were several possibilities.
 A tree nearby could allow access to a window, and a grappling hook was one of the tools. I brought up the tree first, but she had hesitations about it because she didn’t know if a branch would hold up both of us. She took to the grappling hook idea.
 Looking over other tools available, I saw a note where Bloom was supposed to praise or mention what he thought of you based on your prior talk, according to Mosser.
 It’s another generative twist in the gameplay that shows how players impact the characters.
 The next section dealt with the guard, and the first thing I asked was if we knew anything about him.
 She said he had prior military experience, so I knew maybe a tranquilliser dart may not be a good idea. I suggested sleeping gas, and she liked that idea.
 The last section was the surveillance camera, and I brought up the idea of an EMP, but she said it would cause too much of a ruckus. It also wasn’t on the list of tools.
 The most obvious answer was a smoke bomb, but I also saw a diagram, where we could cut the electricity. I went with that.
 She then asked what we should do if things went awry and the guards found us. I responded, saying, “I’m going to curl up in a ball and cry.” Iron actually got my sarcasm but wasn’t amused by my joke.
 Unfortunately, the AI demo took what I said literally, and it showed you the result of the attempted heist in the third part. We failed. That joke had serious repercussions, as Bloom gave a rundown in the after-action report.
 He said that my bawling did provide enough distraction for us to escape, but we didn’t get the files. Again, the technology isn’t perfect, but it showed some fascinating gameplay opportunities and unexpected responses.
 Final thoughts
 It seems as though AI in games is still a bit of a ways off, but there are moments where it could be used in subtle gameplay ways.
 That Bloom note is an example of generative AI creating a summary of your actions. That could be helpful if you’re returning to a game after a few months and need to know what you did previously.
 For some of the more ambitious elements, such as the Neo NPCs, that’s going to be much more impactful when it comes to story-driven games.
 It fundamentally changes how video games are written. Although branching dialogue doesn’t need to be written, the characters that game studios create have to be more nuanced and have a deeper background.
 They need to have stories and motivations behind their actions and responses. Writers will need to come up with whether they grew up with pets, who their parents were, what matters to them, and how they perceive the world. It’s up to the writers to put the ghost in the machine.
 In order to bring characters to  life, studios need people who can create compelling characters, and if they don’t, they will appear off to players who are bound to ask them all sorts of questions. Mosser said they’ll hallucinate answers that may not jibe with the fiction.
 That, in turn, will require deeper lore from which the AI bots need to draw from.
 Games have bibles worth of stories that never reach the masses, but having AI bring that up through conversation would be a more immersive way to expose players to that narrative than through walls of texts or random pickups.
 As for the acting, there’s a long way to go before AI can capture the nuance and subtlety of human performances. Many of the character’s performances felt flat compared to human voice acting.
 It’s notable, though, that the characters that stood out in my mind were the confrontational ones. Diego Martinez and Wendy, the robot, left more of an impression than the polite and nice NPCs.
 Although having a game full of Neo NPCs seems a little daunting or far in the future with the amount of storytelling involved, it could be good and doable in spurts.
 It would be a way to bring more narrative depth to the down moments of a campaign. It would create more compelling moments that correspond to the realism that players see in the graphics. – The Mercury News/Tribune News Service",glimpse future game developer conference indie game buzz kernel idea artificial intelligence centre stage nvidia jaw capability chipsets software company ubisoft intriguing gameplay opportunity source hype fear labour conflict hollywood tech industry company efficiency primordial tech ooze video game transformative impact industry enter convai convai company developer tool firsthand project life representative bot guide novice player online game playable character concierge agency player location locale surfboard hang virtual beach notable answer question environment bot term memory recall player raise privacy issue bot speaker profile memory developer memory time stormgate real time strategy game frost giant studio demo character sitrep battlefield demo game npc offer hint project neural nexus impressive demo project neural nexus cyberpunk player situation woman seraph guide player normal scene video game transition bigger fight convai official talk inhabitant walked objective learning fun character money hiccup demo seraph gun hard futuristic sci weapon submachine gun character curious hair cut time hair enemy conversation mae shadow liang character bound law assassin geneva convention trade surprise answer interaction robot wendy robot hostile offence robot shot memorable conversation strange npc elicit strong reaction simple conversation believability demo experience nvidia demo covert protocol inworld technology situation gain access nexalife chief technology officer cto talk gaining doorman tae comedian joke bit tepid guide reception sophia sophia cto wavre hotel policy client privacy bar aware item diego martinez nexalife executive strain write keynote speech colleague standoffish told police sarcastic gruff demo failure convai peel response convai demo diego remember developer technology hand video game company demo neo npc future dystopic player resistance bloom virginie mosser ubisoft narrative director experience conversational gameplay previous demo player objective trust neo npc player bloom fellow resistance fighter megacorporations son child evrand effort trust level time robot prowess player bring subject character front bloom violent positive person boundary question steer conversation mission subtle surreal answer neo npc question pierce base vague answer normal heist demo iron female leader resistance opinion mission break villa steal file yard possibility nearby access window hook tool tree hesitation branch hook idea tool bloom praise mention prior talk generative twist gameplay player character prior military experience dart idea gas idea surveillance camera idea emp ruckus list tool obvious answer smoke bomb diagram cut electricity guard curl ball cry iron sarcasm joke demo attempted heist joke repercussion rundown action report provide distraction escape technology perfect fascinating gameplay opportunity unexpected response final game moment subtle gameplay bloom note generative summary action game month ambitious element neo impactful story game video game dialogue character game studio deeper background story motivation action response writer pet parent matter perceive writer machine bring character life studio people compelling character player sort question hallucinate answer fiction deeper lore bot game bible worth story mass conversation immersive expose player wall text random pickup capture nuance subtlety human performance character performance flat human voice notable character mind confrontational diego martinez wendy robot impression polite nice npc game neo future amount doable spurt narrative depth moment campaign compelling moment realism player mercury news tribune news service,"[(1, 0.998163)]",1
667998,StarEdu,8,07/04/2024,Is AI a passing fad?,Trends can be distracting when there are issues that need genuine attention,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and ChatGPT are all the rage right now. Generative AI can do some amazing things, like writing essays on a given topic or creating stunning videos simply from text prompts. With such a powerful tool, the possibilities are truly mind-boggling. 
 No wonder companies are jumping onto the AI bandwagon, and those that aren’t run the risk of being seen as falling behind. 
 According to a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, 27% of jobs are at high risk due to the AI revolution. 
 In December last year, the European Parliament passed the world’s first Act on AI, and other nations, including Malaysia, are soon to follow suit.
 Academia has also been caught up in the fervour of AI. Universities across the globe have launched a slew of new programmes in AI, and it has become fertile ground for new research opportunities. 
 Universities dedicated to AI, such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI in the Middle East, have even been established. 
 Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir has also recently mooted establishing Malaysia’s first AI polytechnic (An eye on AI, Sunday Star, March 17, 2024).
 Will AI be a game-changer in the way that some evangelists would have us believe? Will it one day even render universities obsolete? Who knows. 
 In this techno-centric world, it’s increasingly hard to distinguish between what might be the beginning of a new dawn, and a trendy new wave that will inevitably pass with time. After all, it was not that long ago that evangelists were touting blockchain and virtual reality (VR) as the next big things. It seems every new technological innovation carries with it a degree of hype. 
 Research firm Gartner even coined a phrase for it, known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, where the hype is at its greatest at the “peak of inflated expectations” before settling down into the “trough of disillusionment”, “scope of enlightenment” and eventual “plateau of productivity”.
 We are also now living in an age of education evangelism. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when universities were forced to conduct teaching and learning remotely, there was a view that online learning would become the new norm. 
 Post-pandemic, this has shown not to be the case, and most universities, including my own, seem to have largely returned to on-campus, face-to-face learning. Yes, perhaps there is now a greater smattering of online lectures and remnants of online assessment, but we’ve largely returned to the old norm rather than embracing a new one. 
 Don’t get me wrong – there are probably more universities offering online degrees than ever before, but it has enhanced or complemented rather than displaced traditional face-to-face learning.
 Even before the global pandemic, massive open online courses (MOOCs) were all the rage and thought to be a disruptor of sorts. Though the major MOOC players are still around, they are hardly thriving, and the MOOC movement has largely come and gone. If one visits the Malaysia MOOC website hosted on openlearning.com, you will find a total of only four courses. 
 In Gartner’s hype cycle, we’ve reached the plateau of productivity. The MOOC evangelists seem to have moved on, as have the gamification and mobile learning evangelists before them. I’m not sure how long the micro-credential evangelists will be around for.
 There’s nothing wrong with getting excited about new innovations, but we should not forget about the basics, like staff development, teacher training, well-equipped classrooms, and reliable Internet access. 
 Truth be told, many of us would prefer to read about the last developments in AI versus the last developments in education pedagogy. The problem comes when such trends become a distraction for issues that deserve genuine attention or worse still, somehow become embedded in strategy, organisational objectives and crude KPIs. 
 In Malaysia, we seem to be a nation obsessed with creating new roadmaps and continually chasing the next big thing. 
 In five years, AI may no longer be the “in-thing”, and the peak of inflated expectations will have passed. But not to worry, because the next “big thing” will have arrived by then to replace it.

668256,Main,17,07/04/2024,Combat drones and AI: Urgently create rules to prevent abuse,,"DRONES, which can be operated away from a battlefield, could bring about the casual use of force, as their operations allow the attacking side not to factor in its own human casualties. International rules must be created urgently.
 In Ukraine, where fierce battles are continuing, both Russia and Ukraine have used drones not only for reconnaissance but also for attacks. The Russian military has utilised self-destructing drones to destroy infrastructure and other facilities in Ukraine, while the Ukrainian military has sunk Russian naval vessels with unmanned surface vehicles.
 Drones have also been used in the Israel war on Gaza, particularly in the killing of senior Hamas members even in Lebanon and Syria.
 The growing use of drones for military purposes appears to stem from their lower cost compared with fighter jets and missiles, as well as their ability to operate continuously for long periods of time.
 Japan has also drawn up plans in its Defence Buildup Program, which was devised in late 2022, to invest a total of ¥1 trillion (RM31.3bil) for the introduction of drones over the five years from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2027. The move is aimed at compensating for a shortage of Self-Defence Forces personnel by replacing manned vehicles with drones.
 China aims to establish technology to launch so-called saturation attacks by flying numerous small drones like a swarm. The Japanese Defence Ministry has been developing laser equipment that will shoot down multiple drones at once. The nation’s defence  system should also be strengthened.
 The use of drones has continued to expand, but drone attacks pose ethical problems.
 As attackers operate drones through monitor screens, they may come to feel as if they are playing a game. That could numb their hesitation to take a human life.
 Particularly due to  the advance of artificial intelligence, there is a possibility that Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), in which AI sets targets and carries out attacks without human judgement, will be put to practical use.
 In recent years, countries such as the United States, China and Russia have been considering international rules related to LAWS, but there are conflicting views between nations that seek strict regulations and others that want to minimise rules. Late last year, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to regulate LAWS.
 The Japanese government has expressed its stance not to develop LAWS and is aiming to first devise a non-legally binding code of conduct.
 Under international humanitarian law, the use of force during a war is confined to military targets and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Regarding the use of drones as well, countries need to reaffirm these regulations in line with such principles as not targeting civilians.
 It goes without saying that AI must not be allowed to make decisions that will take human lives. The Japanese government should lead efforts to create strict, effective rules. — The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN",drone battlefield casual force operation factor human casualty international rule ukraine fierce battle russia ukraine drone reconnaissance attack russian military utilised drone destroy infrastructure facility ukraine ukrainian military sunk russian naval vessel unmanned surface vehicle drone war gaza senior hamas lebanon syria drone military purpose lower cost fighter jet missile ability period time japan drawn plan buildup program invest total bil introduction drone fiscal fiscal move compensating shortage defence force personnel manned vehicle drone aim technology launch saturation attack numerous drone swarm japanese defence ministry laser equipment shoot multiple drone nation defence system drone drone attack ethical attacker drone monitor screen game numb hesitation human life advance artificial intelligence possibility autonomous weapon system law set target attack human judgement practical country china russia international rule law view nation strict regulation rule united nation law japanese government stance develop law devise code conduct international humanitarian law force war military target attack drone country regulation principle civilian decision human japanese government lead effort strict effective rule ann,"[(4, 0.99441564)]",4
668052,Main,31,07/04/2024,Concern over AI use in Gaza war,Guterres decries using cold calculation of algorithms in life and death decisions,"New York: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed serious concern over reports that Israel was using Artificial Intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, resulting in many civilian deaths.
 According to a report in independent Israeli-Palestinian magazine +972, Israel has used AI to identify targets in Gaza – in some cases with as little as 20 seconds of human oversight.
 Guterres said that he was “deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military’s bombing campaign includes Artificial Intelligence as a tool in the identification of targets, particularly in densely populated residential areas, resulting in a high level of civilian casualties.”
 “No part of life and death decisions which impact entire families should be delegated to the cold calculation of algorithms,” he said.
 The +972 report claims that “the Israeli army has marked tens of thousands of Gazans as suspects for assassination, using an AI targeting system with little human oversight and a permissive policy for casualties”.
 The report said that, according to “six Israeli intelligence officers”, a system dubbed Lavender had “played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war”.
 “According to the sources, its influence on the military’s operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine ‘as if it were a human decision’,” +972 reported.
 Two sources said “the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians”.
 The Israeli army, known as the IDF, on Friday rejected the claims.
 “The IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist,” it said.
 Instead it has a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources... on the military operatives of terrorist organisations” to be used as a tool for analysts, it added.
 “The IDF does not carry out strikes when the expected collateral damage from the strike is excessive,” it said, using a term that includes civilian casualties.
 Israel began hyping AI-powered targeting after an 11-day conflict in Gaza during May 2021, which commanders branded the world’s “first AI war”.
 The military chief during the 2021 war, Aviv Kochavi, told Israeli news website Ynet last year the force had used AI systems to identify “100 new targets every day”, instead of 50 a year previously.
 Weeks into the latest Gaza war, a blog entry on the Israeli military’s website said its AI-enhanced “targeting directorate” had identified more than 12,000 targets in just 27 days.
 An unnamed Israeli official was quoted as saying the AI system, called Gospel, produced targets “for precise attacks on infrastructure associated with Hamas, inflicting great damage on the enemy and minimal harm to those not involved”.
 But an anonymous former Israeli intelligence officer, quoted in November by +972, described Gospel’s work as creating a “mass assassination factory”.
 In a rare confession of wrongdoing, Israel on Friday admitted a series of errors and violations of its rules in the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza, saying it had mistakenly believed it was “targeting armed Hamas operatives”.
 Alessandro Accorsi, a senior analyst at Crisis Group, said the +972 report was “very concerning”.
 “It feels very apocalyptic. It’s clear... the degree of human control is very low,” he said.
 “There are a thousand questions around this obviously – how moral it is to use it – but it is hardly surprising it is used,” he said. — AFP",york secretary antonio guterres concern report artificial intelligence identify target civilian death report independent israeli palestinian magazine israel identify target human oversight guterres troubled report israeli military bombing campaign artificial intelligence tool identification target residential level civilian casualty life death decision entire family cold calculation report claim israeli army ten thousand gazans suspect assassination system human permissive policy casualty israeli intelligence officer system played central role palestinian stage war source influence military operation output machine human decision source week war junior hamas operative lavender permissible kill civilian israeli army idf friday claim artificial intelligence system identifies operative person terrorist database purpose cross reference intelligence source military operative organisation analyst carry strike collateral damage strike excessive term civilian casualty day conflict gaza commander war military chief war aviv kochavi israeli news website ynet force system identify target day week war blog entry israeli military website directorate target day israeli official system gospel target precise attack infrastructure inflicting damage enemy minimal harm anonymous israeli intelligence officer november gospel mass assassination factory rare confession israel friday series error violation rule aid worker hamas alessandro accorsi senior analyst crisis report feel apocalyptic degree human control low question moral surprising afp,"[(1, 0.995298)]",1
667946,StarBiz 7,2,06/04/2024,PayNet all set to jump on the AI bandwagon,,"TRADITIONAL payments are increasingly being replaced by digital payments in Malaysia, as the nation strives towards becoming a cashless society.
 This trend is especially prevalent following the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the transition and change in people’s views on money.
 According to a Bank Negara report, e-payment adoption among Malaysians had risen to 11.5 billion transactions in 2023 from 9.3 billion in the previous year.
 Despite the clear signs that e-payment is on the rise, Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) group chief executive officer Farhan Ahmad says digital payments will not completely replace cash payments, rather both will continue to co-exist in the coming years.
 Speaking with StarBizWeek, he says accepting cash payments makes sense for some people, particularly for small businesses as having the ability to visualise cash in hand provides greater assurance.
 “I do not see cash going away fully any time soon,” he says, while acknowledging that digital payments are still much better than cash due to the benefits of convenience, efficiency, security and data value to businesses and consumers.
 The notion of digital payments being unsafe and risky is inaccurate, Farhan points out, adding that there are also risks in carrying cash in hand, as it can lead to a loss, be it accidental or theft.
 Since the majority of consumers tend to opt for digital payments, businesses may lose a fraction of their earnings if these businesses choose not to offer a digital payment alternative, he says.
 PayNet is a payment network and financial market infrastructure provider in Malaysia. Among the services it offers are Interbank Giro, JomPAY, DuitNow and shared ATM network and MEPS ATM.
 Recognising the vast opportunities that artificial intelligence (AI) offers, Farhan says PayNet is jumping on the technology bandwagon to strengthen Malaysia’s participation in the field.
 He notes AI is becoming a ubiquitous presence in everyday life, as it revolutionises the finance industry and offers consumers a safer and more inventive platform.
 One of the main challenges in advancing Malaysia’s journey towards AI, however, is the large sum of investments needed to adopt the technology.
 “AI requires massive investments and raising several hundred million ringgit will not be enough,” Farhan says.
 He explains that the group is currently collaborating with several researchers within the AI space, as well as from Imperial College London and Oxford University to find ways to set foot into the space and be a part of the discussion.
 Farhan says the group has also inked agreements with several companies to kickstart research on AI, and that PayNet is eager to collaborate with other Asian countries for this move towards further innovation.
 We have to make this country better and easier for financial technologies to come in because the opportunities that Malaysia presents are amazing, he adds.
 He reveals PayNet has a few AI projects up its sleeves with a focus on security, data privacy as well as creating a localised large language model for Malaysia.
 He adds that PayNet’s first venture into the world of AI will be in terms of security use cases, as it is one of the primary areas that will be exploited by malicious intentions.
 PayNet is in it for the long run as the main objective of adopting AI is to use it to protect the rakyat.
 “Being one of the nation’s guardians of the financial systems, I am confident in PayNet’s position as one of the top organisations and systems globally that utilise AI not only for growth, but also for the nation’s security and data privacy as well,” he says.
 Moving forward, PayNet highlights the significance of achieving shared prosperity, and as a digital payment platform, it needs to have a strong and comprehensive vision for the next few decades.In this regard, Farhan says it is imperative to have a robust public-private partnership to leverage digital payments as the true enabler of economic prosperity, as it will not only benefit the company, but also the public at large.
 He adds PayNet is looking to develop new projects in Melaka, Johor and Sabah, as well as in fields that have yet to be covered as an effort to create shared prosperity and grow digital payments automatically.",traditional payment digital payment malaysia nation cashless society trend prevalent covid pandemic transition change people view money bank negara report payment adoption transaction previous sign payment rise payment network malaysia sdn bhd paynet chief executive officer ahmad digital payment cash payment starbizweek cash payment people business ability visualise cash hand assurance cash time digital payment cash benefit convenience efficiency security data business consumer digital payment unsafe risky inaccurate farhan risk cash hand lead loss accidental theft majority consumer opt digital payment business lose fraction earnings business offer digital payment alternative paynet payment network financial market infrastructure provider malaysia service interbank giro jompay duitnow atm network meps vast opportunity artificial intelligence offer paynet jumping technology bandwagon strengthen malaysia participation field note ubiquitous presence everyday life finance industry consumer inventive platform main challenge malaysia journey sum investment technology massive investment ringgit farhan researcher space imperial college london oxford university foot space discussion farhan agreement company paynet eager collaborate asian country innovation country easier financial technology opportunity reveals paynet project sleeve security data privacy localised language model malaysia paynet venture term security primary malicious intention main objective adopting rakyat nation financial system confident paynet position top organisation system utilise growth nation security data privacy paynet highlight significance prosperity digital payment platform strong comprehensive vision decade farhan imperative robust public private partnership leverage digital payment true economic prosperity company public paynet develop project johor sabah field effort create prosperity grow digital payment,"[(5, 0.99630517)]",5
667402,StarProperty,8,05/04/2024,Facing tomorrow: Enhancing real estate with technology and AI,Developers are making strides but digitalisation is slow,"By Liew Jia Yi (Yanika)
 yanika.liew@thestar.com.my
 For the average person, social media today has rapidly taken over the role of information broker. With its own ecosystem for news ranging from celebrities to real-time business upheavals, platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and TikTok spearhead hot-button issues of today’s culture. 
 So it comes to no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) technology is creeping into the real estate industry. Such systems learn the pattern and behaviour of human users, so imagine its capabilities in the future, Ian Scott Inteltech managing director Mohd Izharudin Amanudin said during the 31st National Real Estate Convention.
 The AI system receives more data through constant usage and in turn, becomes more enhanced. Today’s algorithms are only the beginning. In real estate, AI can offer solutions to streamline processes like property valuation, enhance customer experience and identify valuable opportunities, Izharudin said. 
 He pointed to increased lead generation. Through predictive analysis, AI could identify potential buyers. When it comes to repeat clients, the system would be able to learn the intricacies of customer preferences and provide personalised solutions.
 The AI can improve the homeownership process, where a system can keep track of loans and other factors that impact homebuyers while retrieving and analysing data on the property market.
 “Property valuation and pricing can be much more precise based on market demand and historical data, there is a lot of historical data by the system,” Izharudin said.
 He pointed out that these insights could feasibly provide risk mitigation. Investment in AI would also mean investment in a system that has the tools to identify solutions to these risks.
 “These systems provide a competitive advantage in identifying emerging trends. For example, in new housing areas, they have a new lifestyle, what do they want? You learn the pattern. So we need a new system to enhance – not to take over the job – but to enhance the job,” he added.
 This is similar in the case of marketing, especially when it comes to digital platforms and applications targeted to home solutions, Izharudin said.
 Developers today have already begun promoting applications for property management, encompassing homeowner tasks such as rent collection, maintenance scheduling and visitor registration. While these are not yet in the scope of AI, it is easy to see how improved technology would be able to further enhance the homeowner experience.
 Analysis of large chunks of data could be done very quickly, utilising the system instead of human resources. This could also add to cost-saving measures as the cost of human resources increases. The system would be able to monitor amenities such as the water tank, lift and other utilities.
 With a detailed map of each property, security would easily be manageable through the AI system. Whether in the form of facial recognition, identification or safety measures, Izharudin noted that the system would make it easier to monitor fire hazards or detect firearms.
 A developer problem
 “The shift from the brick-and-mortar way to digitalisation of the sales process is inevitable in Malaysia. It shows that the technology is an enabler for us to unlock the next level of the business potential,” PKNS general manager of corporate finance and strategy Netty Hezreena Abd Malek said.
 “We as a property developer in PKNS face two main challenges when it comes to sales and marketing, so first, end financing challenges and the second one is lack of adoption of digital marketing tools,” she pointed out.
 Based on a 2022 Real Estate And Housing Developers' Association (Rehda) Institute report, a significant number of total loans applied for residential purchases were not approved due to ineligibility, lowered margin of financing, as well as inadequate documentation. 
 However, real estate agents and developer sales teams would have no way of knowing this information beforehand. 
 “This process frustration is wasted time for our sales team, so if we can screen the prospect earlier, then it will allow us more time for us to focus on closing high-quality leads,” Netty said.
 She pointed out that according to the report, 48% of property developers spend less than RM400,000 on digital marketing tools, despite 67% acknowledging the impact of digital marketing initiatives.
 The factors that contribute to a lack of investment in digital marketing tools is because of the lack of competent people handling the technology platform. The second is the high cost of the software itself, Netty noted.
 “So we came up with a good solution for us to try to establish a centralised function of marketing and sales. With this, it allows us to leverage on the right competencies plus the technology to be advertised to a larger base,” she said.
 PKNS’ centralised digital platform, PKNS Hartanah Elite, is part of the developer strategy to include the closing of the sales process in digitalisation. From the signing of listings to buying inventory, the platform can give value to stakeholders across transactions.
 “This is how we want to improve our profitability and enhance our asset valuations. We are using Proptech as a service. This platform has improved in terms of capability in project management. We understand that the most effective lead generation is coming from the agent, so we are focusing on facilitating agents that we have on board,” Netty said. 
 The platform would allow the agent to upload, manage, track and use a single price chart. It was also equipped with a developer dashboard, with live price charts, real-time project health, appointment, booking, loan applications and advanced analytics by demographic.
 The application would be included to display the margin of financing for a certain area, as well as individual bank approval rates.
 “So, out of this dashboard, we have sales management and financial institution integration, so buyers can proactively select and apply for products from various banks. Instead of submitting multiple applications, buyers can submit a single application that will be transmitted to multiple banks,” Netty pointed out.
 Through seamless digital integration, stakeholders from homebuyers, agents, banks and developers, will be able to enjoy increased operational efficiency.
 Missing parts
 While digital marketing and AI progression promise efficiency, Izharudin noted that there are still challenges and limitations to implementing AI and digitalisation in real estate. 
 “Data bias. It can be right, it can be wrong, it may not be accurate, again it depends on the data that it receives,” Izharudin said.
 ChatGPT itself is notorious for hallucinating information, and as it stands, there is an increased concern for data security. Lack of proper regulation stifles the environment from which such strides in technology can flourish.
 “There is a difficulty in trusting their decision, sometimes the decisions made by the AI itself can be questionable because again as I said, the machines are still learning. When we design the system, the data that we receive must be accurate,” Izharudin said.
 “Do we still need humans? Yes, to decide what to ask and how to provide context, legal compliance, et cetera. To compensate for AI weakness, we need humans,” he added.",liew jia liew average person social medium role broker news celebrity real time business upheaval instagram twitter tiktok spearhead hot button issue culture artificial intelligence technology real estate industry system pattern behaviour human user capability future ian scott inteltech director mohd izharudin amanudin national real estate convention system data constant usage algorithm real estate offer solution property valuation customer experience identify valuable opportunity lead generation predictive analysis potential buyer client system learn intricacy customer preference personalised solution homeownership process system track loan factor homebuyers data property market property valuation pricing precise market demand historical data historical data system izharudin insight risk mitigation investment investment system identify solution risk system competitive advantage trend housing lifestyle pattern system job enhance job marketing digital platform application solution izharudin developer application property management homeowner task rent collection maintenance visitor registration scope easy technology enhance homeowner experience analysis chunk system human resource cost saving cost human resource system monitor amenity water tank lift utility map property security manageable system form facial recognition identification safety measure system easier monitor fire hazard firearm shift brick mortar digitalisation sale process inevitable malaysia technology enabler unlock level business potential pkns manager corporate finance strategy netty hezreena abd malek property developer pkns main challenge sale financing challenge adoption digital marketing tool real estate housing developer institute report total loan residential purchase ineligibility margin inadequate documentation real estate agent sale team process frustration time sale screen prospect earlier time focus quality netty report property developer digital marketing tool impact digital marketing initiative factor lack investment digital marketing tool competent people technology platform cost software netty solution function marketing sale leverage competency technology larger base pkns digital platform pkns hartanah developer strategy sale process digitalisation signing listing inventory platform stakeholder transaction profitability enhance asset valuation service platform term capability project management effective lead generation agent agent board agent upload manage track single price chart developer live price chart real time project health appointment loan application analytics demographic application display margin individual bank approval rate sale management financial institution integration buyer apply product bank multiple application buyer single application multiple bank seamless digital integration stakeholder homebuyers agent bank developer operational efficiency digital marketing progression promise efficiency izharudin limitation digitalisation real estate data bias wrong accurate depends receives izharudin notorious stand increased concern data security proper regulation environment stride technology flourish difficulty decision decision questionable machine design system data accurate izharudin human context legal compliance cetera compensate weakness human,"[(5, 0.99784106)]",5

665637,Lifestyle,4,01/04/2024,Mapping mortality    through AI,Danish researchers are exploring algorithms to estimate life expectancy and delving into the impact of social bonds on our health and longevity.,"RESEARCHERS in Denmark are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) and data from millions of people to help anticipate the stages of an individual’s life all the way to the end, hoping to raise awareness of the technology’s power and its perils.
 Far from any morbid fascinations, the creators of life2vec want to explore patterns and relationships that so-called deep-learning programmes can uncover to predict a wide range of health or social “life-events”.“It’s a very general framework for making predictions about human lives. It can predict anything where you have training data,” said Sune Lehmann, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and one of the authors of a study recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science.For Lehmann, the possibilities are endless. “It could predict health outcomes. So it could predict fertility or obesity, or you could maybe predict who will get cancer or who doesn’t get cancer. But it could also predict if you’re going to make a lot of money,” he said.
 The algorithm uses a similar process as that of ChatGPT, but instead it analyses variables impacting life such as birth, education, social benefits or even work schedules.
 The team is trying to adapt the innovations that enabled language-processing algorithms to “examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences”.
 “From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the paediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on,” Lehmann said.
 Yet the disclosure of the program quickly spawned claims of a new “death calculator”, with some fraudulent sites duping people with offers to use the AI program for a life expectancy prediction – often in exchange for submitting personal data.
 The researchers insist the software is private and unavailable on the Internet or to the wider research community for now.
 Data from six million
 The basis for the life2vec model is the anonymised data of around six million Danes, collected by the official Statistics Denmark agency.
 By analysing sequences of events, it is possible to predict life outcomes right up until the last breath.
 When it comes to predicting death, the algorithm is right in 78% of cases; when it comes to predicting if a person will move to another city or country, it is correct in 73% of cases.
 “We look at early mortality. So we take a very young cohort between 35 and 65. Then we try to predict, based on an eight-year period from 2008 to 2016, if a person dies in the subsequent four years,” Lehmann said.
 “The model can do that really well, better than any other algorithm that we could find,” he said.According to the researchers, focusing on this age bracket, where deaths are usually few and far between, allows them to verify the algorithm’s reliability.
 However, the tool is not yet ready for use outside of a research setting.
 “For now, it’s a research project where we’re exploring what’s possible and what’s not possible,” Lehmann said.
 He and his colleagues also want to explore long-term outcomes as well as the impact that social connections have on life and health.‘Public counterpoint’
 For the researchers, the project presents a scientific counterweight to the heavy investments into AI algorithms by large technology companies.
 “They can also build models like this, but they’re not making them public. They’re not talking about them,” Lehmann said.
 “They’re just building them to, hopefully for now, sell you more advertisements, or sell more advertisements and sell you more products.”
 He said it was “important to have an open and public counterpoint to begin to understand what can even happen with data like this”.
 This was especially true, according to Pernille Tranberg, a Danish expert on data ethics, because organisations like insurance companies were already using similar algorithms.
 “They probably put you into groups and say, ‘Okay, you have a chronic disease, the risk is this and this’,” Tranberg said.
 “It can be used against us to discriminate (against) us so that you will have to pay a higher insurance premium, or you can’t get a loan from the bank, or you can’t get public healthcare because you’re going to die anyway,” she said.
 When it comes to predicting our own demise, some developers have already tried to make such algorithms commercial.
 “On the Web, we’re already seeing prediction clocks, which show how old we’re going to get,” Tranberg said. “Some of them aren’t at all reliable.” – AFP",researcher artificial intelligence data million people stage individual life awareness technology power peril fascination creator life vec explore pattern relationship deep learning programme wide range health social life event prediction human data sune lehmann professor technical university denmark dtu author journal nature computational science lehmann possibility predict health outcome fertility obesity cancer cancer lot money algorithm process chatgpt variable life birth education social benefit schedule adapt innovation language processing algorithm examine evolution predictability human detailed event sequence life event people visit paediatrician start school move location lehmann disclosure program claim death calculator fraudulent people offer program life expectancy prediction exchange personal data researcher software private unavailable internet wider community data basis life model data dane official statistic denmark agency sequence event life outcome death algorithm person city country mortality cohort period person subsequent lehmann model algorithm researcher age bracket death algorithm reliability tool ready setting project lehmann colleague term outcome social connection life health public counterpoint researcher scientific counterweight heavy investment technology company model public lehmann building sell advertisement advertisement product public counterpoint understand data true pernille tranberg danish expert data ethic organisation insurance company chronic disease risk discriminate pay insurance premium loan bank public healthcare die demise developer commercial web prediction clock reliable afp,"[(0, 0.99562824)]",0
665641,Lifestyle,5,01/04/2024,Anguilla’s unexpected AI windfall,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence’s integration into everyday life has stirred up doubts and unsettling questions for many about humanity’s path forward. But in Anguilla, a tiny Caribbean island to the east of Puerto Rico, the AI boom has made the country a fortune.
 The British territory collects a fee from every registration for Internet addresses that end in “.ai”, which happens to be the domain name assigned to the island, like “.fr” for France and  “.jp” for Japan. With companies wanting Internet addresses that communicate they are at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Elon Musk’s X.ai website for his AI company, Anguilla has recently received a huge influx of requests for domain names.
 For each domain registration, Anguilla’s government gets anywhere from US$140 (RM665) to thousands of dollars from website names sold at auctions, according to government data. Last year, Anguilla’s government made about US$32mil (RM151.7mil) from those fees.
 That amounted to more than 10% of the gross domestic product for the territory of almost 16,000 people and 91 square kilometres.
 “Some people call it a windfall,” said Anguilla’s premier, Ellis Webster. “We just call it God smiling down on us.”
 Webster said the government used the money to provide free healthcare for citizens 70 and older, and it has committed millions of dollars to finish building a school and a vocational training centre.
 The government has also allocated funds to improve its airport, doubled its budget for sports activities, events and facilities, and increased the budget for citizens seeking medical treatment overseas, he said.
 The island, which relies heavily on tourism, had been hard hit by the pandemic’s restrictions on travel and a devastating hurricane in 2017.
 The .ai domain income was the boost the country needed. “We never thought that it would have this potential,” Webster said.
 Anguilla’s control of .ai dates to the early days of the Internet, when nations and territories were assigned their slice of cyberspace. Anguilla received .ai, and its government, whose own site is www.gov.ai., did not make much of it until the domain names started bringing in millions.
 Officials are uncertain how long the boon will last, but they predicted 2024 would bring in similar income as last year from domain names.
 It is not the first bonanza to make a big difference to a grateful domain owner. Tuvalu, a string of islands northwest of Australia, sold the rights to its suffix, “.tv”, to a Canadian entrepreneur for US$50mil (RM237mil), and used the money to bring electricity to the outer islands, create scholarships and finance the process of joining the United Nations.
 The South Pacific island of Niue, on the other hand, gave an American businessman the rights to its “.nu” suffix in the 1990s in exchange for connecting it to the Internet.
 The island later claimed to have been cheated out of cash that came through the sale of the domain name to thousands of Scandinavians attracted by the suffix “nu”, which means “now” in Swedish, Danish and Dutch.
 But Anguilla realised early enough that it could not let this unexpected jackpot slip away.
 “It’s just lucky for us,” Webster said. – The New York Times",artificial intelligence integration everyday life doubt unsettling question humanity anguilla tiny caribbean island east puerto rico boom country british territory collect fee registration internet domain france japan company address forefront boom elon musk website company anguilla huge influx request domain registration anguilla government thousand dollar name auction government data anguilla government mil mil fee gross domestic product territory people square people windfall anguilla premier webster call god webster government money free healthcare citizen million dollar finish school vocational training centre government fund airport budget sport activity event facility budget citizen medical treatment island relies hard hit pandemic restriction hurricane domain income boost country potential webster anguilla control date day nation territory slice cyberspace anguilla government site domain name million official bring income domain name difference grateful domain owner island australia right suffix canadian entrepreneur mil mil money electricity create scholarship finance process united nation pacific island niue hand american businessman right suffix exchange internet island cheated cash sale domain thousand scandinavian suffix swedish danish dutch anguilla unexpected jackpot slip lucky webster york time,"[(2, 0.99444515)]",2
665645,Lifestyle,6,01/04/2024,AI copyright clash,,"FRANCE’S competition watchdog said it fined Alphabet’s Google €250mil (RM1.28bil) for breaches linked to EU intellectual property rules in its relationship with media publishers, citing concerns about the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) service.
 The watchdog said Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard, since rebranded under the name Gemini, was trained on content from publishers and news agencies, without notifying them.
 Google has pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings, the watchdog said, adding that the company has also proposed a series of remedy measures for certain shortcomings.Google said it accepted the settlement “because it is time to move on”, adding that “we want to focus on the larger goal of sustainable approaches to connecting people with quality content and on working constructively with French publishers”.
 The company said the fine was disproportionate and said the watchdog had not sufficiently taken into account its efforts “in an environment where it’s very hard to set a course because we can’t predict which way the wind will blow next”.
 The fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content in a case triggered by complaints from some of the country’s biggest news organisations, including Agence France Presse (AFP).
 The dispute appeared to be resolved in 2022 when the US tech giant dropped its appeal against an initial €500mil (RM2.56bil) fine issued at the end of a major investigation carried out by the Autorite de la Concurrence.
 In a statement, the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the settlement, including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information.
 The watchdog in particular cited Google’s AI chatbot Bard, which it launched in 2023, which it said was trained on data from unspecified media outlets and news agencies without the company informing them or the regulator.
 “Subsequently, Google linked the use of the content concerned by its AI service to the display of protected content”, the watchdog said, adding that in doing so, Google hindered the ability of publishers and press agencies to negotiate  fair prices.
 The fine comes as many publishers, writers and newsrooms seek to limit the scraping – or automatic collection of data – by AI services of their online content without their consent or fair compensation.
 The New York Times in 2023 sued Google rivals Microsoft and OpenAI, the creators of the popular artificial-intelligence platform ChatGPT, accusing them of using millions of the newspaper’s articles without permission to help train chatbots.

665679,StarBiz,6,01/04/2024,TM R&D: Industries need AI to maintain competitiveness,,"PETALING JAYA: Industries should adopt artificial intelligence (AI) to maintain their competitiveness, according to the research and innovation arm of Telekon Malaysia Bhd, Telekom Research & Development Sdn Bhd (TM R&D). 
 AI could boost productivity, facilitate better decision-making, improve customer satisfaction, and generate novel solutions, it said. 
 TM R&D chief executive officer Sharlene Thiagarajah said AI’s ability to analyse large datasets and derive insightful information could also be viewed as a useful tool for business enterprises to remain viable in the market.
 From automating routine tasks and optimising processes to extracting actionable insights from vast datasets, many are of the opinion that AI redefines efficiency and innovation, according to Sharlene. 
 Industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, among others, are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and unlock new possibilities.
 “Embracing AI represents a strategic imperative for businesses seeking to stay competitive, foster innovation and navigate the evolving technological landscape,” she told StarBiz. 
 With new AI systems in the pipeline, Sharlene said the group shares the goal of using approaches that improve productivity and automation. 
 At TM R&D, the primary focus of AI implementation has been to deliver exceptional customer service. 
 “It is also crucial to be aware of and mitigate biases that may be present in AI algorithms,” she added. 
 Moving forward, Sharlene said the company had embarked on experiments with large language models (LLM), in late 2022, to elicit user responses, paving the way for its new generative AI-powered interactive and help agent development. 
 AISHA makes use of the LLM, a subset of generative AI created to produce responses that take context into account, adjust to the conversational style of users, and generally react by understanding the meaning of phrases. 
 “This is in contrast to a traditional chatbot that often relies on pre-determined rules and structures, providing generic responses without a comprehensive understanding of the broader context of the conversation,” she added. 
 Additionally, she said TM R&D anticipates LLM to be ubiquitous across several domains and applied across other diverse business concerns. 
 “For example, the application of LLM in chat prompts and a combination of troubleshooting tools had resulted in autonomous resolution issues,” she said. 
 Aside from the LLM AI system, the group also targets to release other systems that leverage predictive analysis as well as generative AI soon. 
 On a separate note, TM R&D had inked a memorandum of understanding with ZTE Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd to collaborate on a range of R&D innovations under its latest strategic partnership programme.

664551,StarBiz,7,29/03/2024,Demand from auto and AI to lift chip industry,Resilient second quarter likely for tech sector,"PETALING JAYA: MIDF Research expects a stronger second  quarter for the technology sector as the semiconductor industry is poised to recover this year.
 In its “Awaiting the cuts 2Q24 market outlook”, the research house said it was maintain its “neutral” stance as the automotive and artificial intelligence (AI) related market could bring in a larger proportion of total sales.
 It noted for the first half of last year, the rebound in semiconductor sales mainly stemmed from the automotive and industrial sectors as well as the growing demand for a range of chips that are critical to AI systems.
 “However, the communication end markets would still command the largest market share. 
 “Moving forward, while the communication end market would still play an important role, we anticipate a higher proportion of sales coming from the automotive and AI-related end market,” it said.
 Quoting the Semiconductor Industry Association, MIDF Research said market growth is projected to continue over the remainder of the year, with annual sales forecast to increase by 13.1% in 2024 to US$588.4bil compared with last year. 
 “January semiconductor industry sales improved by 15.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) to US$47.6bil, the highest growth rate since May 2022. 
 “This indicates that the monthly sales should be on an upward trajectory to achieve the forecast, except for February given the shorter working days,” it noted.
 Meanwhile, shipments of the iPhone to China had dropped 33% in February and had notably declined by 24% y-o-y in the first six weeks of this year.
 “This has also led Apple’s market share of the Chinese smartphone market to decline to 15.7%, placing it in fourth place from the second place a year ago. 
 “On the contrary, Huawei posted a growth of 64% y-o-y thanks to its homegrown Mate 60 Pro devices,” MIDF Research said.The research house explained the concerns led Apple Inc to offer discounts on its iPhone on top of allowing its partner vendors in China to offer discounts to spur demand.
 “We view that this could have a trickle-down effect in terms of volume order and cost down from Apple to its supply chain,” it said.
 Additionally, the Biden administration’s consideration of blacklisting some Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co is likely to further strain the US-China trade relations as the United States seeks to suppress China’s AI and semiconductor ambitions. 
 The report said the companies include chipmakers Qingdao Si’eEn, SwaySure, Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co. as well as China’s leading memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc.
 “The US government is also asking the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, and Japan to further tighten restrictions on China’s access to semiconductor technology. We view that Malaysian outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) providers would not be impacted by the sanctions surrounding Huawei, but will have a positive spillover effect on Malaysia as the China +1 strategy would continue to be deployed,” MIDF Research said.
 The trade war escalation would cause Chinese semiconductor firms to look for Malaysian OSAT providers to mitigate the potential risk of broader sanctions.
 Separately, MIDF Research said there is potential for the government to award more contracts to information technology  companies  that provide e-government and information technology services.
 “We believe that MyEG Services Bhd could potentially benefit via its recently acquired 14.4% stake in HeiTech Padu Bhd,” it said.
 MIDF Research noted that Datasonic Group Bhd was awarded a six month extension contract worth RM135mil until May.

664579,StarBiz,9,29/03/2024,Experts stress importance of responsible AI growth,,"BEIJING: No country, including the United States, can single-handedly lead the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), and only global cooperation can ensure that AI will remain safe and beneficial for all, say experts and company executives at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Boao, Hainan province. 
 Their remarks were an attempt to address “AI anxiety” among sections of the Chinese AI industry following the launch of text-to-video generator Sora by US firm OpenAI.
 Zeng Yi, a researcher of the Institute of Automation, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the United Nations High-level Advisory Body on AI, said: “The US will not lead the future AI development alone, nor will China. Unless we move forward hand in hand, no country will.”
 Zeng emphasised that AI is a foundational technology and an enabler.
 “The world is vast enough to allow China, the United States and many other countries to find their own opportunities in building infrastructure and driving applications.
 “If the culture of China differs from that of the United States, then please provide a profound understanding of how a different culture might envision the empowerment of technology in the future and how we can deeply integrate science and humanity to offer more possibilities for the world.”
 The more pressing issue, he said, is how the world can unite to truly develop AI that is safer, more reliable and more trustworthy.
 Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading AI researcher, said that competition in the field is by and large healthy, but the idea of a zero-sum game is a “huge mistake”.
 “If AI can be created to be safe and beneficial, and more capable than human beings, then it can function as a source of unlimited wealth,” he said. “In that sense, there is no need to compete for such technology.”
 Russell further said that a more important issue is to coexist healthily and safely with this technology, which is still an open question for the world.

663963,StarBiz,11,27/03/2024,Microsoft Bing chief exiting role after Suleyman named AI leader,,"NEW YORK: Microsoft Corp’s Mikhail Parakhin, head of the company’s Bing search engine and advertising businesses, will exit those roles and look for a new position, a week after the software giant named Mustafa Suleyman to oversee consumer artificial intelligence (AI) work and asked Parakhin to report to him.
 Parakhin, who had been chief executive officer for advertising and web services, will report to chief technology officer Kevin Scott while searching for his next role, Microsoft said.
 Parakhin also oversaw some parts of the company’s Windows software business. That work will be shifted to Pavan Davuluri, who had been overseeing hardware and the rest of Windows. 
 Davuluri will now run all of Windows and Surface hardware, reporting to executive vice-president Rajesh Jha, who disclosed the changes in a staff email Monday. 
 Jha’s email and a spokesperson didn’t specify if Parakhin was likely to leave Microsoft or take a new role within the company.
 Parakhin’s exit from a core part of the company’s consumer AI products marks the first shuffle stemming from chief executive officer Satya Nadella’s move last week to install Suleyman, a co-founder of AI researcher DeepMind, as head of a unified push in the space.
 The move illustrated Nadella’s impatience with his team’s efforts, two people familiar with his thinking said last week. 
 Over the past year, Microsoft has baked AI into the Bing search engine, Windows, Office and other products, creating various digital assistants under the brand Copilot.

663501,StarMetro,6,26/03/2024,"Experts: Adapt to AI, don’t fear it","Workers need to retrain, upskill, innovate to work alongside machine intelligence","ALTHOUGH artificial intelligence (AI) will have a big impact on businesses and people’s lives, employees should adapt rather than fear it, say industry experts in George Town, Penang.
 Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association president Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai said AI would likely replace humans in the supply chain management and production line, but not all jobs would be at risk.
 “For example, jobs that require emotional intelligence, empathy and personal interaction as well as judgement, like journalism and human resources, are not under threat.
 “These jobs involve creativity and innovative problem-solving, which are challenging for AI to replicate,” said Wong.
 He also pointed out that jobs such as repair work that needed physical adaptability and dexterity in variable conditions were difficult for AI and robots to perform conclusively.
 “The more complex a job is and the more domains it cuts into, the less likely would AI be able to replace humans,” he said. 
 He explained that the speed and extent of AI adoption would depend on economical and ethical considerations, adaptability of workers and nature of the work.
 Wong gave the example of quality control as one area where an AI system with advanced image recognition capabilities, would be a preferred choice.
 “Here, AI should be more accurate in predicting when machines will need maintenance, reducing downtime and need for constant human monitoring.
 “In supply chain management, AI can handle forecasts, fulfilment and inventory management through data analysis and modelling,” he added.
 In 2022, it was reported that there were about 2.72 million people employed in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia, with 590,000 workers alone in the electrical and electronics industry.
 Wong thinks the debate on whether AI will replace humans will continue but that people should learn from similar claims about automation in the past.
 “In reality, automation actually pushes people to work better and find more value-added functions.
 “Those who have a positive perception will embrace it and shift their skills, but this necessitates retraining and upskilling for many workers,” said Wong.
 Small and Medium Enterprises Association Malaysia national secretary Yeoh Seng Hooi said employees needed to reskill and upskill themselves to stay relevant, especially those doing manual repetitive jobs.
 “When it comes to new development and innovation, you need the human factor as the human mind cannot be replaced.
 “We have to start training people to use their thinking cap more, instead of just hard labour,” said Yeoh. 
 He predicted that fields like warehouse management would likely go the way of AI but that human input for design, sales and marketing was still required.
 “In certain departments, the number of employees will go down but pay for skilled workers will increase and the company will still save money,” he said.
 Wong and Yeoh’s views come at a time when the impact of AI is a concern, especially on jobs and ethics.
 Recently, a list of the 12 most pressing concerns that AI poses to humanity was compiled after a three-day conference in Singapore.

663609,StarBiz,9,26/03/2024,Cook tells forum AI is key for climate battle,Apple pouring huge investments into developing tool,"BEIJING: Apple Inc chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook said artificial intelligence (AI) is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog last Sunday at the China Development Forum (CDF).
 Cook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company’s commitment to China. 
 He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple’s supply chain, stores and research in the country.
 Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint – with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon-neutral product. 
 Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.
 “We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,” Cook said of the company’s environmental goals.
 Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.
 AI “provides an enormous toolkit for every company that’s wishing to be carbon-neutral or lower their emissions by a substantial amount,” the 63-year-old chief executive officer said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person’s carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.
 Like Apple, China’s leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest. However, US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.
 The Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year’s list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li’s opening speech. 
 Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because “it’s so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming.” His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.
 “To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,” Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co, Lens Technology Co and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.
 The environmental theme to Cook’s trip – which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai – may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the United States and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok in the United States if its Chinese owner doesn’t divest.
 Apple has been on the receiving end of China’s riposte, as it’s had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.
 The company’s global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net-zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.
 Apple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. 
 When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 tonnes of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network.
 It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly in China. — Bloomberg",apple chief executive officer ceo tim cook artificial intelligence essential tool business carbon footprint climate change dialog sunday china development forum cdf cook discussion annual beijing event culmination week public display company commitment china commerce minister wang wentao plan apple supply chain store country apple ambitious target peer carbon footprint apple watch carbon neutral product cook theme remark progress road innovation cook company environmental goal apple substantial investment resource development aggressive competitor chatgpt enormous toolkit company carbon neutral lower emission substantial amount chief executive officer business individual person carbon footprint identify material recovery offer apple china tech company contest trade sanction access semiconductor nvidia corp apple chief cdf time business cook marquee name list participant time event person covid isolation china premier qiang international corporation speech cook reporter china dynamic enjoy social team weibo profile visit partner coffee business apple technology product partner share commitment innovation planet cook supplier technology shenzhen precision technology coffeemaker saturnbird coffee ground container environmental theme cook trip expansive store shanghai avoid afoul geopolitical sensitivity relation united china deteriorate threat bytedance tiktok united chinese owner divest apple china riposte navigate ban iphones chinese government business company global corporate operation neutral aim net climate impact entire business manufacturing supply chain product life cycle apple goal plastic product packaging exterior plastic wrap iphone packaging apple tonne waste impact vast manufacturing network hundred million iphones ipads china,"[(0, 0.9960678)]",0
663209,Lifestyle,5,25/03/2024,The AI conspiracy factory,"Conspiracies about monsters, asteroids, and vampires are flooding TikTok, driven by AI-generated  content.","FROM vampires and wendigos to killer asteroids, TikTok users are pumping out outlandish end-of-the-world conspiracy theories, researchers say, in yet another misinformation trend on a platform whose fate in the United States hangs in the balance.
 In the trend reported by the nonprofit Media Matters, TikTok users seek to monetise viral videos that make unfounded claims about the US government secretly capturing or preserving mythical monsters that include – wait for it – King Kong.It is the latest illustration of misinformation swirling on the platform – a stubborn issue that has been largely absent in recent policy debates as US lawmakers mull banning the Chinese-owned app on grounds of national security.
 Often accompanied by spooky background music, the videos – many of which garner millions of views – feature imperious AI-generated voices, sometimes mimicking celebrities.
 “We are all probably going to die in the next few years. Did you hear about this?” said a voice impersonating podcaster Joe Rogan in one viral video.
 “There’s this asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth,” the voice claims, citing information leaked by a government official who stumbled upon a folder titled “keep secret from the public”.
 At least one account peddling that video appeared to be deactivated after AFP reached out to TikTok for comments.
 ‘Highly engaging’
 Conspiracy theory videos, often posted by anonymous accounts, typically had the telltale signs of AI-generated images such as extra fingers and distortions, said TikTok misinformation researcher Abbie Richards.
 Peddling such theories can be  financially rewarding, Richards said, with TikTok’s “Creativity Program” designed to pay creators for content generated on the platform.
 It has spawned what she called a cottage industry of conspiracy theory videos powered by artificial intelligence tools, including text-to-speech applications that are widely – and freely – available online.
 A TikTok spokeswoman insisted that “conspiracy theories are not eligible to earn money or be recommended” in user feeds.
 “Harmful misinformation is prohibited, with our safety teams removing 95% of it proactively before it’s reported,” she said.
 Still, tutorials on platforms such as YouTube show users how to create “viral conspiracy theory videos” and profit off TikTok’s Creativity Program.
 One such tutorial openly instructed users to start by making up “something outrageous” such as “scientists just got caught hiding a sabre-toothed tiger”.
 “Financially incentivising content that is both highly engaging and cheap to manufacture creates an environment for conspiracy theories to thrive,” Richards wrote in the Media Matters report.
 Threat of AI
 Such concerns, driven by rapid advancements in AI, are particularly high in a year of major elections around the world.
 Recently, the European Union wielded its powerful Digital Services Act (DSA) to press several platforms, including TikTok, on the risks of AI – including from deepfakes – for upcoming elections in the 27-nation bloc.
 In the United States, where the app has some 170 million users – roughly half the country’s population – lawmakers overwhelmingly backed a bill recently to ban TikTok unless Chinese parent company ByteDance divested itself within six months.
 The bill, which still needs to pass the more cautious upper house of the US Congress, risks riling young voters in a key election year.
 US policymakers have repeatedly expressed concerns about TikTok’s alleged ties to the Chinese government, user data safety and its apparent impact on national security.
 According to a report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Chinese government is using TikTok to expand its global influence operations to promote pro-Beijing narratives and undermine American democracy, including through disinformation.
 “Disinformation should be part of the debate about TikTok,” said Aynne Kokas, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.
 Many experts, however, as well as young users who rely on the app as their primary source of news, oppose banning TikTok, saying it’s unfair to single out the platform.
 “There’s lots of misinformation on TikTok, just as there is on other social media platforms. Some of that misinformation is dangerous,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
 “(But) investing the government with the authority to suppress misinformation – or to ban Americans from accessing platforms that host misinformation – is not a sensible response to this problem. Nor would it be a constitutional one,” he added. – AFP",vampire killer asteroid user outlandish conspiracy theory researcher trend platform fate united hang balance trend nonprofit medium matter user viral video claim government mythical monster kong illustration misinformation platform stubborn issue absent policy lawmaker mull chinese app ground national security spooky background music video garner million view imperious voice celebrity hear voice podcaster joe rogan viral video asteroid collision earth voice claim leaked government official folder secret public account video deactivated afp tiktok comment conspiracy theory video anonymous account telltale sign image extra finger distortion misinformation researcher abbie richards theory richards tiktok creativity program pay creator platform cottage industry conspiracy theory video artificial intelligence tool text speech application tiktok spokeswoman conspiracy theory eligible earn money feed harmful misinformation safety team tutorial platform user viral conspiracy theory video profit tiktok creativity program tutorial instructed user outrageous scientist sabre tiger content cheap manufacture environment conspiracy theory richards medium matter threat concern rapid advancement major election union powerful digital service dsa press platform tiktok risk deepfakes upcoming election nation bloc app user half country population lawmaker bill ban tiktok chinese parent company bytedance month bill cautious upper house congress risk voter key election policymakers concern tie chinese government user data safety apparent impact national security report office director national intelligence chinese government tiktok expand global influence operation pro beijing narrative undermine american democracy disinformation disinformation debate tiktok aynne medium study university virginia expert user primary source news tiktok unfair single platform lot misinformation social medium platform dangerous jameel jaffer director amendment institute columbia university government authority suppress misinformation ban american platform host misinformation response constitutional afp,"[(2, 0.9965568)]",2
661551,StarBiz,5,20/03/2024,YTL AI Cloud to deploy advanced supercomputer,Data centre in Johor will speed up country’s AI adoption,"KUALA LUMPUR: YTL Power International has announced the formation of YTL AI Cloud, a specialised provider of massive-scale graphic processing unit (GPU)-based accelerated computing.
 YTL AI Cloud will deploy and manage one of the world’s most advanced supercomputers on Nvidia Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud, an artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer for accelerating the development of generative AI.
 In a statement yesterday, YTL said the YTL AI Supercomputer will be located in a 664-ha data centre facility in the YTL Green Data Centre Campus in Johor, powered by a renewable energy source from its on-site 500-megawatt solar power facility.
 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said YTL AI Cloud, the first for Malaysia, will accelerate Malaysia’s adoption of AI and spearhead the development of the country’s Sovereign Cloud. 
 “The collaboration with Nvidia is a testament to Malaysia’s attractiveness as a hub for digital investments,” he said.
 Meanwhile, Investment, Trade and Industry Minister, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the AI Cloud will create high-value, high-income jobs for Malaysians.
 “This marks a significant step forward in our mission to become a leading AI and data centre hub in the region,” he said.
 He said the initiative not only brings Malaysia closer to achieving its goals under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030, but also demonstrates Malaysia’s capability and readiness to play a significant role in the global technology landscape.
 It is to be noted that  YTL will be among the first companies to adopt Nvidia GB200 NVL72 – a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system with fifth-generation NVLink.
 The supercomputer will be interconnected by Nvidia Quantum InfiniBand networking platform.
 The platform acts as a single GPU with 1.4 exaflops of AI performance and 30 terabytes of fast memory, and is designed for the most compute-intensive workloads.
 The YTL AI Supercomputer will surpass more than 300 exaflops of AI compute, making it one of the fastest supercomputers in the world.
 “There is no doubt that AI is a critical tool that will power the global digital economy,” said Digital Minister, Gobind Singh Deo (pic).He said having one of the most powerful Nvidia cloud computing infrastructures in Malaysia is a game changer and will spark innovation and development of solutions which are instrumental to the success of the Malaysia Digital Economy blueprint.
 “Nvidia is working with YTL AI Cloud to bring a world-class accelerated computing platform to South-East Asia – helping drive scientific research, innovation and economic growth across the region,”  founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia, Jensen Huang said.

660937,StarBiz,11,18/03/2024,Apple without AI looks more like Coca-Cola than high-growth tech,,"NEW YORK: For two decades, no company better embodied the promise of the stock market than Apple Inc. Its transformation from niche computer maker to the most valuable corporation on the planet made its shares a cornerstone of investment portfolios worldwide.
 But in what seems like a blink of an eye, Apple’s sheen is starting to fade. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the story in technology now, driving the kind of growth that the company used to count on from selling its gadgets and services to eager consumers across the globe.
 This has Apple investors in a quandary. Its revenue expansion is stagnating, and the stock is underperforming the Nasdaq 100 by about 16 percentage points, the most to start a year since 2013. 
 The company still generates massive revenues, but whether that can keep increasing at the pace investors have come to expect is an open question. Apple executives say they have big plans for AI, which bulls hope will help revive growth. But so far it’s hard to gauge its prospects.
 All of which has investors wondering, if Apple’s AI dreams don’t come to fruition, what is the role of the shares today?
 “It’s become more of a value stock, a bit like Coca-Cola,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management and chief market strategist at Osaic. 
 “All the things you want that’s going to offer you a defensive profile and market rate returns for the foreseeable future until they have a new catalyst.”
 Apple remains the reliable money machine it’s always been. It’s certainly a shareholder-friendly cash flow juggernaut, and a safe haven with a bulletproof balance sheet. 
 “If you’re a long-term investor that really likes solid, stable growth, that’s very annuity like, with growing margins, improving profitability and a business that generates significant amounts of cash and still has lots of innovation runway, we think Apple is a great place to be,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.
 But investors looking to buy into the next big growth market have turned their attention to AI. Nvidia Corp is taking Apple’s place as the tech behemoth to own due to the seemingly insatiable demand for chips used to power large language models.  
 Valuation wipeout
 Apple has fallen more than 10% this year, erasing around US$330bil in market capitalisation, and ceding its position as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp, whose incorporation of ChatGPT into products like its Office software is starting to boost revenue growth. 
 Microsoft now has a market value of almost US$3.1 trillion versus Apple’s US$2.7 trillion. Nvidia, whose revenue and profits have soared amid an arms race for AI computing power, isn’t far behind at US$2.2 trillion.
 The problem isn’t so much that Apple has suddenly stopped growing, that’s been happening for a while – its revenue shrank in every quarter of its last fiscal year even as the stock was hitting records. 
 The trouble is the company hasn’t shown anything on AI at a time when iPhones sales are sluggish and the company is facing mounting regulatory threats.
 “We’re going through an incredible wave of innovation,” said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities. “The market is telling you that Apple has a lot to prove here and to date it hasn’t shown much.”
 Notoriously secretive, Apple has divulged little about its plans to incorporate AI services into its products. Chief executive officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple would “break new ground” in AI this year and market professionals are anticipating big news at the company’s annual software developer’s conference in a few months. 
 However, many investors are losing patience and turning to stocks with a clearer path in AI.
 At the core of Apple’s woes is the disappearance of revenue growth and it’s unclear what, if anything, will stoke it. The company’s first major new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro headset, isn’t expected to contribute significantly to growth for years. 
 Apple recently pulled the plug on its long effort to build an electric car. At the same time iPhone revenue has stagnated and sales in China have dropped amid a weak economy and greater competition.
 Regulatory pressures
 On top of that Apple is facing mounting pressure from regulators. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about US$2bil by the European Union over an investigation into claims it blocked music-streaming rivals on its platforms.
 In the United States, the Justice Department appears close to filing an antitrust lawsuit after five years of work building a case alleging Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads to impede competition from rivals.
 Sales in fiscal 2023 fell 3% and are projected to rise just 2% in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, revenue expanded at a 33% clip in 2021. 
 Meanwhile, Nvidia’s sales are projected to jump 79% and Microsoft’s 15% in the companies’ current fiscal years. 
 For the past couple of years, Apple has commanded a premium valuation on par with Microsoft’s. Two years ago, when tech stocks got hit hard, the shares held up far better than those of its peers. But that’s no longer the case. 
 Apple is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from about 30 times last summer. That’s similar to Walmart Inc‘s valuation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is priced at 32 times and Nvidia at 35 times. 
 That said, Microsoft trading at a record high may actually offer a good example of Apple’s long-term potential. When Satya Nadella took over the company in 2014 it was a software maker with a 20th century mindset and a languishing stock. Now it’s everywhere, from the cloud to AI, and its stock is soaring.
 “Everyone has to reinvent themselves, and it just shows you how quick the revolution in tech is,” Citizens JMP’s Lehmann said. “Microsoft finally got going, but it took them 15 years to figure it out.”
 Despite this year’s gloomy performance, it’s easy to make the case that Apple shares are poised for a rebound and that it’s too early to count it out of the AI race. 
 The company has more than US$170bil in cash on its balance sheet and its net income is expected to top US$100bil this year. 
 That gives Apple unmatched resources to push into new markets and still return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
 “It’s hard to not compare to what’s the hot thing right now,” Jensen Investment Management’s Walkush said. “If you took AI out of the picture right now, and the sensationalism, would people look at Apple differently? I think they would.” — Bloomberg",york decade company promise stock market apple transformation niche computer maker valuable corporation planet share investment portfolio eye apple sheen fade artificial intelligence story technology growth company count gadget service eager consumer apple investor quandary revenue expansion stock nasdaq percentage start company massive revenue pace investor question apple executive bull revive growth hard gauge prospect investor apple fruition role share stock bit coca cola phil blancato chief executive officer thalmann asset management chief market strategist osaic defensive profile market rate return foreseeable future catalyst apple reliable money machine shareholder friendly cash flow juggernaut safe bulletproof balance sheet term investor solid stable growth annuity margin profitability business generates amount cash lot apple kevin walkush portfolio manager jensen investment management investor growth market attention corp apple tech insatiable demand chip power language model valuation apple bil market capitalisation position valuable company microsoft corp incorporation chatgpt product office software boost revenue growth microsoft market versus apple nvidia revenue profit arm race power apple revenue quarter fiscal stock hitting record trouble company time iphones sale sluggish company regulatory threat incredible innovation mark lehmann chief executive officer citizen jmp security market apple lot secretive apple plan service product chief executive officer tim cook apple break ground market professional news company annual software developer conference month investor patience stock path core apple woe disappearance revenue growth unclear company major product category decade vision headset contribute growth apple plug effort electric car time iphone revenue sale china weak economy competition regulatory pressure top apple mounting pressure regulator month apple bil european union investigation claim music streaming rival platform united justice department filing antitrust lawsuit building apple software hardware limitation ipads competition rival sale rise current data bloomberg comparison revenue clip nvidia sale jump microsoft company current fiscal couple apple premium valuation par microsoft tech stock hard share peer apple time profit month time summer valuation time nvidia time microsoft trading record offer apple term potential satya nadella company software maker century mindset stock cloud stock reinvent quick revolution tech citizen lehmann microsoft figure gloomy performance easy apple share rebound count race company cash balance sheet net income top bil apple unmatched resource push market cash shareholder dividend stock buyback hard compare hot jensen investment management walkush picture sensationalism people apple bloomberg,"[(0, 0.9975945)]",0
660593,StarEdu,2,17/03/2024,An eye on AI,,"The Higher Education Ministry is looking into setting up a polytechnic for artificial intelligence (AI) in Malaysia.
 Its minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir said a study is being conducted on the feasibility of setting up Malaysia’s first AI polytechnic.
 “The University of Tsukuba, which is one of the leading institutes in Japan with its own AI research centre, will also be establishing a branch here.
 “As a start, the varsity will conduct its programme at Universiti Malaya this year,” he said after closing the 15th International Conference on Islamic Economics  & Finance (ICIEF) 2024 in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 22.
 In his speech, Zambry said the  education system’s curriculum  from the preschool to tertiary level is in need of urgent reform.
 TVET
 During a recent visit to Japan, Zambry said a discussion was held to understand the curriculum of the National Institute of Technology, Tokyo College (Tokyo Kosen), and to see how the ministry can upgrade technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Malaysia.
 He said there are over 50 of these institutes in Japan, and that they have produced more than 500,000 graduates in high TVET engineering.
 “One of the ministry’s main focuses is to look at the education system in providing room for students to choose their fields more effectively.
 “The stigma that TVET is a second class education must be eliminated,” he added.
 The Japanese, he said, do not look at TVET as second class education unlike how it is in Malaysia.“In Japan, at age 15, students get to decide between continuing regular schooling and attending a technical school, without needing to ponder about what field they want to venture into at the ages of 17 or 18.
 “They see high level TVET as an extremely important field of study. This is why we want to emphasise its importance.”
 Collaboration
 He also said a focus on science, mathematics and the latest technology is crucial to shape the youth into well-rounded and empowered citizens who are able to thrive in the digital economy as creators of technology rather than mere users.  
 “(But) while more focus on the latest technology is needed, we must not forget that collaboration is key. 
 “It is by fostering collaboration that young minds can learn to develop businesses and social entrepreneurship initiatives that address the critical social and environmental issues of today and tomorrow,” he said.With the increasing speed of discovery of new and modern technology, partnerships between universities, industries, civil societies and government agencies must be strengthened, he added.
 “Innovation manifests when multiple disciplines intersect. This will accelerate the pace of new discoveries and holistic solutions to challenges we face in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world.
 “Interdisciplinary collaboration is what will drive universities and colleges into incubators of change.

660221,StarExtra,8,15/03/2024,AI revolution,,"FRANCE tested Artificial Intelligence-driven video surveillance technology that will be deployed during the Olympic Games at a Depeche Mode concert last week, calling the exercise a success.
 French legislation passed in 2023 permits the use of AI video surveillance for a trial period covering the Games to detect abnormal events or human behaviour at large-scale events.
 The technology could be pivotal to thwarting an attack like the bombing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta or the Nice truck attack in 2016, officials say.
 Rights campaigners warn the technology poses a threat to civil liberties.WHAT IS AI-POWERED SURVEILLANCE?Algorithmic video surveillance uses computer software to analyse images captured by video surveillance cameras in real time.
 Four companies – Videtics, Orange Business, ChapsVision and Wintics – have developed AI software that use algorithms to analyse video streams coming from existing video surveillance systems to help identify potential threats in public spaces.
 The algorithms are trained to detect pre-determined “events” and abnormal behaviour and send alerts accordingly. Human beings then decide if the alert is real and whether to act on it.WHAT WILL THE ALGORITHMS BE LOOKING FOR?The law allows for eight different “events” to be flagged by AI surveillance software during the Games that include: crowd surges; abnormally heavy crowds; abandoned objects; presence or use of weapons; a person on the ground; a fire breaking out; contravention of rules on traffic direction.
 Within these categories, specific thresholds (number of people, type of vehicle, timing etc) can be set manually to cater for each individual event, location or threat.
 WHO WILL USE AI-POWERED SURVEILLANCE?National and local police, firefighters, public transport security agents will all have access to AI-powered surveillance.
 Software developed by Wintics and tested at the Depeche Mode concert, will be deployed in the Paris region and on public transport.
 Paris Police chief Laurent Nunez described the trial as largely a success.
 “Everything went relatively well, all the lights are green (for future use),” he said.WILL FACIAL RECOGNITION BE USED?It should not. The new law continues to ban facial recognition in most cases and French authorities have said it is a red line not to be crossed.
 Nonetheless, rights campaigners are concerned mission creep risks setting in down the line.
 “Software that enables AI-powered video surveillance can easily enable facial recognition. It’s simply a configuration choice,” said Katia Roux of Amnesty International France.
 The legal framework regulating facial recognition remained too fuzzy and technical and legal safeguards were insufficient, according to Amnesty International.
 Wintics co-founder Matthias Houllier said his software’s algorithms were not trained for facial recognition.
 “There’s no personal identification method in our algorithms,” he said. “It’s technically excluded.”
 HOW WILL PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?France’s Interior Ministry has created an evaluation committee to keep tabs on civil liberties throughout the trial period.
 Led by a high ranking official within France’s top administrative court, the committee also comprises the head of the country’s privacy watchdog, CNIL, four lawmakers and a mayor. — Reuters",france artificial intelligence video surveillance technology olympic game mode concert week exercise success french legislation permit video surveillance trial period game abnormal event human scale event technology pivotal attack olympics atlanta nice truck attack official right campaigner technology pose threat civil liberty surveillance algorithmic video surveillance computer software analyse image video surveillance camera real time company videtics business chapsvision wintics software algorithm analyse video stream video surveillance system potential threat public space detect pre event abnormal send alert human alert real algorithm law event surveillance software game surge heavy crowd object presence weapon person ground fire contravention rule traffic direction category specific threshold people vehicle timing cater individual event location threat surveillance national local police firefighter public security agent access surveillance software wintics depeche mode concert paris region public transport paris police chief laurent nunez trial success light green future facial recognition law facial recognition french authority crossed right campaigner concerned mission creep risk software enables video surveillance enable facial recognition configuration choice katia roux amnesty international france legal framework facial recognition fuzzy technical legal safeguard insufficient international wintics founder matthias houllier software algorithm facial recognition personal identification method privacy france interior ministry evaluation committee civil liberty trial period ranking official france top administrative court committee head country privacy cnil lawmaker reuters,"[(2, 0.9958418)]",2

 Tino Bao – already pursuing a doctorate in AI – created a video of his late daughter sending his wife birthday greetings and even singing her a birthday song.
 “Mummy, happy birthday. I really miss you. I hope you will always be happy and pretty,” the AI-generated Bao Rong said in Mandarin in the video, which Tino Bao posted on Facebook in January.

659560,StarBiz,11,13/03/2024,OpenAI calls Musk’s claims incoherent  in court filing,,"SAN FRANCISCO: OpenAI lambasted Elon Musk’s allegations against it, saying in a court filing that the billionaire entrepreneur’s claims “rest on convoluted – often incoherent – factual premises”. 
 The strongly worded filing is the company’s first legal response to Musk’s February lawsuit against the company, chief executive officer Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman. 
 Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp, its largest investor. 
 In the filing, OpenAI stressed that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because “there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear”. 
 OpenAI also denied Musk’s claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.
 “The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,” OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. 
 “Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganise and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.”
 OpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicised battle since well before the court case. 
 Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. 
 Musk has criticised OpenAI for its commercialisation strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft. 
 In its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc, his car company. 
 It also said in the filing that Musk was in favour of OpenAI operating as a for-profit company, but only if he controlled it. 
 “Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,” the company’s lawyers wrote.

657697,StarBiz,8,08/03/2024,Widening lead  in AI memory chips,SK Hynix investing US$1bil to capture demand,"SEOUL: SK Hynix Inc is ramping up its spending on advanced chip packaging, in hopes of capturing more of the burgeoning demand for a crucial component in artificial intelligence (AI) development: high-bandwidth memory (HBM).
 The Icheon-based firm is investing more than US$1bil in South Korea to expand and improve the final steps of its chip manufacture, said Lee Kang-Wook, a former Samsung Electronics Co engineer who now heads up packaging development at SK Hynix. 
 Innovation with that process is at the heart of HBM’s advantage as the most sought-after AI memory, and further advances will be key to reducing power consumption, driving performance and cementing the company’s lead in the HBM market.
 Lee specialises in advanced ways of combining and connecting semiconductors, which has grown in importance with the advent of modern AI and its digestion of vast troves of data via parallel processing chains. 
 While SK Hynix has not disclosed its capital expenditure budget for this year, the average analyst estimate puts the figure at 14 trillion won (US$10.5bil). That suggests advanced packaging, which could take up a 10th of that, is a major priority.
 “The first 50 years of the semiconductor industry has been about the front-end,” or the design and fabrication of the chips themselves, Lee said in an interview. “But the next 50 years is going to be all about the back-end,” or packaging.
 Being first to achieve the next milestone in this race can now catapult companies into industry-leading positions. 
 SK Hynix was chosen by Nvidia Corp to provide the HBM for its standard-setting AI accelerators, pushing the South Korean firm’s value up to 119 trillion won. 
 Its stock has gained nearly 120% since the start of 2023, making it South Korea’s second most valuable company and outperforming Samsung and US rival Micron Technology Inc.
 Lee, now 55 years old, helped pioneer a novel method to packaging the third generation of the technology, HBM2E, which was quickly followed by the other two major makers. 
 That innovation was central to SK Hynix winning Nvidia as a customer in late 2019.
 Stacking chips to derive greater performance has long been Lee’s passion. In 2000, he earned his PhD on 3D integration technology for micro-systems from Japan’s Tohoku University, under Mitsumasa Koyanagi, who invented stacked capacitor DRAM used in mobile phones. 
 In 2002, Lee joined as principal engineer at Samsung’s memory division, where he led the development of Through-Silicon Via (TSV)-based 3D packaging technologies. That work would later become the foundation for developing HBM. 
 HBM is a type of high-performance memory that stacks chips on top of one another and connects them with TSVs for faster and more energy-efficient data processing.
 But back in the pre-smartphone era, Samsung was making bigger bets elsewhere. And the norm was for global chipmakers to outsource to smaller Asian nations the tasks of assembling, testing and packaging chips.
 So when SK Hynix and US partner Advanced Micro Devices Inc introduced HBM to the world in 2013, they remained unchallenged for two years before Samsung developed its HBM2 in late 2015. 
 Lee joined SK Hynix three years later. They joked, with a measure of pride, that HBM stood for “Hynix’s Best Memory.”
 “SK Hynix’s management had better insights into where this industry is headed and they were well prepared,” said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea. 
 “When the opportunity came their way, they grabbed it with both hands.” As for Samsung, “they were caught napping.”
 ChatGPT’s release in November 2022 was the moment Lee had been waiting for. By that time, his team had developed a new packaging method called mass reflow-molded underfill, aided by his contacts in Japan. 
 The process, which involves injecting and then hardening liquid material between layers of silicon, improved heat dissipation and production yields. 
 SK Hynix teamed up with Namics Corp in Japan for the material and a related patent, according to a person familiar with the matter. — Bloomberg",seoul hynix spending chip packaging demand crucial component artificial intelligence development bandwidth memory hbm icheon firm bil south korea expand final step chip manufacture lee wook samsung electronics head development hynix innovation process heart hbm advantage memory advance key power consumption performance company lead hbm market lee specialises semiconductor grown advent modern digestion vast trove data chain hynix capital expenditure budget average analyst estimate figure bil packaging major priority semiconductor industry front design fabrication chip interview packaging milestone race catapult company industry position hynix corp hbm standard accelerator south korean firm stock south korea valuable company samsung rival micron technology lee method generation technology hbm major maker central hynix nvidia customer chip derive performance lee passion phd integration technology micro system tohoku university mitsumasa koyanagi stacked capacitor dram mobile phone lee principal engineer samsung memory division development silicon tsv packaging technology hbm hbm type performance memory stack chip top connects faster energy efficient data pre smartphone era samsung bigger bet global chipmakers asian nation task chip hynix partner micro device hbm unchallenged samsung hbm lee hynix measure pride hbm hynix memory hynix management insight industry prepared sanjeev rana analyst clsa security opportunity hand samsung chatgpt release november moment lee time team method mass reflow contact japan process liquid material layer heat dissipation production yield hynix namics japan material patent person familiar matter bloomberg,"[(0, 0.9956517)]",0
657751,Main,14,08/03/2024,Will AI replace human writers one day?,,"OVER the weekend, I read an article written by my friend who was sharing stories of his recent trip to the United States. I was mesmerized by his elaborate descriptions of his experience, so much so that I made it a point to find out more about this beautiful country where many have realised their American dream. The US is now on my travel bucket list. 
 Not only has this friend inspired me to visit the US, but his article has also reaffirmed to me that writing is a skill, and it is perfected with practice. 
 In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in various industries and sectors, including journalism and writing (with tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot). Naturally, such advancements have raised the question on whether AI will one day replace humans.  
 So, will AI replace human writers one day?
 Let’s take this friend of mine as an example. He is an introvert who loves drawing and also has a knack for writing. From reading the article about his experience in the US, I am confident that the answer to the question is no. Producing an eloquent piece demands not just grammatical flair, but it also requires innovative and creative perspectives that will resonate with the readers. For this, you need to experience the subject matter.
 The whole experience and emotions that are drawn upon will make the article unique. I can’t reiterate enough that human creativity and the nuances of human emotions are simply indispensable in crafting high-quality content that will capture the readers’ attention.  
 So, while there are many existing and potentially new technologies out there to assist us in developing content, we humans are simply irreplaceable. You can use these technologies as a guide, but don’t do it blindly. I kid you not; AI-generated content can easily be spotted.

657365,StarBiz,14,07/03/2024,OpenAI fires back with emails in Musk lawsuit,Startup alleges failed bid to merge with Tesla,"NEW YORK: OpenAI fired back at a lawsuit filed against it by Elon Musk in a blog post on Tuesday, using the billionaire’s own emails to show he backed the company’s plans to become a for-profit business and that he insisted it raise “billions” of dollars to be relevant compared with Google.
 Musk filed the lawsuit last week against OpenAI, chief executive officer Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman, alleging the start-up had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp, its largest investor. 
 In the post, OpenAI said that Musk was lashing out after trying and failing to make the company part of Tesla Inc.
 “We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired – someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,” the company said in the post. 
 It was co-authored by several of OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman, Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.
 The post also reproduced emails Musk had sent to people at the company, demonstrating that the billionaire had endorsed OpenAI’s fundraising efforts. 
 “This needs billions per year immediately, or forget it,” Musk wrote in one email, according to OpenAI.
 OpenAI, as a non-profit, raised less than US$45mil from Musk and more than US$90mil from other donors, according to the blog post. 
 Musk pushed the company to be far more ambitious in its fundraising, the emails showed. 
 At the outset, Altman and Brockman planned to raise US$100mil, OpenAI said, but Musk objected, saying the number should be higher.
 “We need to go with a much bigger number than US$100mil to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending. I think we should say that we are starting with a US$1bil funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn’t provide.”
 Musk alleges in his suit that the start-up’s close relationship with Microsoft has undermined its original mission of creating open-source technology free from undue corporate influence. 
 “To this day, OpenAI Inc’s website continues to profess that its charter is to ensure that AGI ‘benefits all of humanity’,” the lawsuit said, referring to artificial general intelligence, a powerful type of AI that doesn’t yet exist. 
 “In reality, however, OpenAI Inc has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.”
 According to the emails in the post, Musk had signed off on the idea that OpenAI wouldn’t build open-source software for artificial general intelligence and that it would not always share the science behind its technological advances. 
 “As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open,” Sutskever wrote in a 2016 email cited by the start-up. 
 “The Open in OpenAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after it’s built, but it’s totally okay to not share the science,” the email read. In his response, Musk replied: “Yup.”
 In the blog post, the OpenAI co-founders said that Musk hadn’t always been opposed to corporate influence at OpenAI. 
 They said that Musk had attempted to make OpenAI part of his auto company Tesla, writing in an e-mail: “Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero.”
 Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Musk is suing OpenAI for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and claims of unfair business practices, among other grievances. 
 He has brought the suit in the capacity of a donor to the nonprofit parent organisation as recently as 2019 and is seeking to force the San Francisco-based start-up to stop benefitting Microsoft and Altman personally.

656947,StarBiz,2,06/03/2024,Tanco to list unit developing RM2bil AI port in PD,,"PETALING JAYA: Tanco Holdings Bhd plans to undertake an “infrastructure listing” of its subsidiary, which is building a RM2bil smart container port in Port Dickson.
 In a statement yesterday, Tanco said it will be seeking permission from relevant authorities to float Midports Holdings Sdn Bhd, a 79%-owned unit of Tanco, on Bursa Malaysia in due course.
 Midports, via a tie-up with the Negri Sembilan state government, will build the port – dubbed as Malaysia’s first artificial intelligence (AI) port – on Tanco’s 480-acre landbank.
 The site, located at the midway of the Straits of Malacca, features a natural deep water access with more than 21 m in depth and is capable of accommodating the largest container ships globally.
 On March 4, Midports entered into a joint venture (JV) with Menteri Besar Negri Sembilan (Pemerbadanan) (MBINS) to develop the container port.
 Following this, a JV company will be set up to undertake the construction and future operations of the port.
 The JV company will be 80% owned by Midports with the balance 20% by MBINS.
 Tanco group managing director Datuk Seri Andrew Tan Juan Suan said the AI port will offer logistical advantages.
 This will be done by significantly reducing transportation costs for gateway containers for businesses currently dependent on distant ports.
 It will also enhance speed and efficiency for transshipment containers.
 “We have started our groundwork and invited foreign industrialists to the smart AI container port location.
 “These industrialists have expressed positive feedback and interest for the potential development of new industrial park(s) in close proximity to the smart AI container port in order to establish a more conducive trade and logistic ecosystem to accelerate the state’s industrialisation plans,” he said.

656629,StarBiz,15,05/03/2024,Nvidia becomes Tesla successor as market flips from EVs to AI,,"NEW YORK: Nvidia Corp’s rise is captivating the stock market and driving the S&P 500 Index to new highs. 
 But it also raises cautionary reminders of another investor darling that soared on dreams of a technological transformation, only to tumble back to earth when those hopes turned to disappointment.
 That stock belongs to Tesla Inc, which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles (EVs) were going to take over the world.
 Back then, Elon Musk’s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co in market capitalisation to become America’s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it “the next Apple Inc”.
 Now, Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their 2021 peak, and other EV stocks that raced higher with it are shadows of their former selves.
 All of which should be sobering for Nvidia investors who see the stock as a limitless bet on an artificial intelligence future. The firm’s shares have added 66% this year after more than tripling in 2023.
 There are plenty of differences between Nvidia and Tesla, from the products they make to the personalities of the men that run the companies. But the parallels are striking.
 Nvidia’s rise from a niche chipmaker to one of the biggest companies in the world is based on the premise that its phenomenal sales growth over the past year has staying power.
 Tesla’s big breakout rally, which occurred in 2020 and put its valuation well over US$1.2 trillion, was pinned on the assumption that EVs would be adopted widely and quickly and that it would be the company to dominate that market.
 But reality has interrupted that story. Demand for EVs is slowing as a wave of enthusiastic first adopters have already bought them, and more price-conscious, change-averse consumers are taking longer than expected to convert to a new technology.
 As a result, Tesla is down 31% from its recent high in July and is one of the biggest percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year.
 “There’s all this potential about the driverless car, the cybertruck and the stock is getting hit. Why? They are losing market share and they are losing margins. In the tech world that is the kiss of death,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital.
 For Nvidia, it’s too early in the hype cycle for any signs of a slowdown. The Santa Clara, California-based company has delivered blow-out results for four consecutive quarters, fuelled by what appears to be insatiable demand for its chips used to train large language models that power AI applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 After more than tripling last year, the stock in 2024 is again the best performer in the S&P 500 Index, with a 66% advance.
 Nvidia’s market value of more than US$2 trillion trails only two American companies: Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp.
 The talk of broad-based use of AI across industries and businesses brings to mind the excitement around the Internet and the years leading into the dot-com bubble.
 But unlike that era, when Internet companies were valued on new metrics like “clicks” while bleeding cash, Nvidia is pumping out massive profits.
 Net income jumped more than 500% to nearly US$30bil last year and is projected to double in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Those big profits and sales, along with the company’s ability to continually beat estimates, have helped keep a lid on valuation metrics.
 Still, Nvidia has the highest price-to-sales ratio in the S&P 500, at 18.
 Currently, the semiconductor manufacturer has a sizable lead in the types of graphics chips that excel at crunching large amounts of data used in AI models.
 But its competitors are eager to grab a piece of that market. Advanced Micro Devices Inc recently released a line of accelerators, and even Nvidia’s customers like Microsoft Corp are racing to develop chips.
 “If you really believe in this AI frenzy, you can visualise a future 10 years from now where AI is embedded in a lot of places, and you need these massive systems running chips that can only be delivered by Nvidia,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital.
 “Even if there’s a perception of a pause in buying, the stock will get hit.”
 None of this is meant to dismiss the disruptive power of electric cars or AI. But it does raise the question of whether investors are paying for future growth that may never arrive. — Bloomberg",york nvidia rise stock market high cautionary reminder investor dream technological transformation tumble earth disappointment stock belongs tesla mania investor electric vehicle elon musk company phenomenon carmaker motor motor market capitalisation america biggest auto manufacturer analyst industry apple tesla share stock shadow nvidia investor stock limitless artificial intelligence future firm share plenty difference tesla product personality company parallel nvidia rise niche chipmaker biggest company premise phenomenal sale growth power tesla rally valuation assumption ev company market reality story demand enthusiastic adopter price conscious change averse consumer convert technology result tesla july biggest percentage decliners potential driverless car cybertruck stock market share margin tech kiss death sameer bhasin principal capital nvidia hype cycle sign slowdown santa clara california company blow consecutive quarter insatiable demand chip language model power application chatgpt stock performer advance nvidia market trail american company apple microsoft corp talk broad industry business brings excitement internet dot bubble era internet company metric click cash nvidia massive profit net income double current data bloomberg profit sale company ability beat estimate lid valuation metric nvidia price sale semiconductor manufacturer sizable lead type graphic chip amount data model competitor eager grab piece market micro device accelerator customer corp racing chip frenzy visualise future lot massive system chip sameer bhasin principal capital perception stock meant dismiss disruptive power electric car question investor future growth arrive bloomberg,"[(0, 0.99599916)]",0
656188,StarMetro,7,04/03/2024,AI initiative for local schools,Association plans to revolutionise teaching using new technology,"PENANG will have an Artificial Intelligence for Schools programme (AI4S), specifically for talent development in the near future.
 The programme under the “Penang 5G Digital Library” initiative by Persatuan Kebajikan 88 Kapten Pulau Pinang (88 Captains) would be able to revolutionise teaching through the use of AI-powered tools and methods, according to the plan.
 88 Captains chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ooi Eng Hock said with AI4S, teachers and educators could personalise learning, improve students’ outcomes and better prepare children in the digital age.
 “AI should supplement their efforts, not be a substitute for them.
 “In addition, to resonate with the recent launch of AI for Rakyat by the Prime Minister, 88 Captains would like to kick off a new programme called AI for Schools to provide infrastructure and guidance by professionals for schools as an extension of our 5G School Digital Library programme,” he said in his speech at the 88 Captains Chinese New Year lunch.
 Ooi said 88 Captains was on the verge of achieving its target to implement the Penang 5G School Digital Library programme in 88 schools in Penang.
 The programme had been implemented in 72 schools  in the state, Ooi said.
 He added that the association received an overwhelming response from the schools, based on the request from Deputy Chief Minister II Jagdeep Singh Deo who wanted 88 Captains to consider expanding the programme beyond 88 schools.
 “We will also support the construction of new schools in Penang, namely SJK (C) Kwang  Aik, SJK (T) Ladang Juru and the building of  ViTrox College,” he said.
 During the lunch event, 16 donors presented mock cheques  of RM150,000 each to the 88 Captains Education Fund (2024-2025), totalling RM2.4mil.
 Also present were Penang governor Tun Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak and his consort Toh Puan Khadijah Mohd Nor, Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Dr Mohamad Abdul Hamid, several state executive councillors and state assemblymen among other dignitaries.
 Chow, in his speech, praised 88 Captains for their efforts in helping improve talent development among youths in Penang.
 He said he could remember that the 88 Captains was established on April 7, 2022, and since then, it has been growing from strength to strength with a mere 58 members.
 “In almost two years, I would say that you have experienced remarkable growth and attained many achievements that are beneficial to Penang and especially to our next generation,” he said.
 Chow added that in November last year, he was at the same location to witness the inaugural scholarship distribution ceremony by 88 Captains with a total allocation of RM500,000.
 He said 10 of the brightest minds from Universiti Sains Malaysia, UOW KDU Penang University College, Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management & Technology and AIMST University were the recipients and beneficiaries of the scholarship.
 He described it as not only an investment of some of Penang’s brightest minds but was optimistic that the money was well spent to secure the future of the younger generation.
 He also acknowledged private entities, that were part of the programme, for providing equipment and expertise to realise the Penang 5G School Digital Library programme.

656204,Lifestyle,5,04/03/2024,Tackling everyday  problems with  AI,"As Singapore shuns heavy regulation and works with Big Tech to build AI tools, some say it could become too reliant on tech firms.","BOOKING a badminton court at one of Singapore’s 100-odd community centres can be a workout in itself, with residents forced to type in times and ­venues repeatedly on a website until they find a free slot. Thanks to AI (artificial intelligence), it could soon be easier.
 The People’s Association, which runs the community centres, worked with a government tech agency to build a chatbot powered by generative artificial intelligence to help residents find free courts in the city-state’s four official languages.
 The booking chatbot, which could be rolled out shortly, is among more than 100 generative AI-based solutions spurred by the AI Trailblazers project, launched last year to find AI-based solutions to everyday problems.
 The project, backed by Singapore government agencies and Google, has also led to the development of tools to scan job applicants’ CVs, develop ­customised teaching curriculums, and generate transcripts of customer service calls.
 It is part of the South-East Asian nation’s AI strategy that is light on regulation and keen on “AI for all”, said Josephine Teo, minister for communications and information.
 “Regulations are certainly part of good governance, but in AI, we have to make sure there is good infrastructure to ­support the activities,” she said at a briefing last month at Google’s Singapore office where some of the new tools were demonstrated.
 “Another very important aspect is building capabilities ...(and) making sure that people not only have access to the tools, but are provided with opportunities to grow the skills that will enable them to use these tools well,” Teo said.
 With an explosion in the use of generative AI globally, governments are racing to curb its harms – from election disinformation to deepfakes – without throttling innovation or the potential economic benefits.
 In Singapore, the focus is on AI adoption in the public sector and industry, and building an enabling environment of research, skills and collaboration, said Denise Wong, an assistant chief executive at Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which ­oversees the country’s digital strategy.
 “We are not looking at regulation – we see a trusted ecosystem as critical for the public to use AI confidently,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 “So we need an ecosystem where companies are comfortable, that allows for innovation and to deploy in a way that is safe and responsible, which in turn brings trust,” she said.
  Responsible AIWith its stable business ­environment, Singapore ­consistently ranks near the top of the global innovation index, climbing to fifth place last year on the strength of its institutions, human capital and infrastructure.
 On AI, Singapore was an early adopter, releasing its first national AI strategy in 2019 with the aim of individuals, businesses, and communities using AI “with confidence, ­discernment, and trust”.
 It began testing generative AI tools in its courts last year, and uses them in schools and in government agencies, and released its second national strategy in December, with the mission “AI for the public good, for Singapore and the world”.
 Also last year, Singapore set up the AI Verify Foundation to develop testing tools for responsible use, and a generative AI sandbox for trialing products. IMDA, along with technology companies IBM, Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, are among its primary members.
 The toolkit, on code-sharing platform GitHub, has drawn the interest of dozens of local and global companies, Wong said.
 “It provides users the means to test on parameters they care about, like gender representation or cultural representation, and nudges them toward the desired outcome,” she added.
 In tests by tech firm Huawei, the toolkit highlighted racial bias in the data, while tests by UBS bank prompted reminders that certain attributes in the data could affect the model’s fairness, according to IMDA.
 “We want to enable everyone to use AI responsibly. But governments cannot do this on their own,” Wong said.
  Goldilocks modelWorldwide, there are more than 1,600 AI policies and strategies from 169 countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
 The United States has opted for a ­market-based model with minimal regulation, while Europe has embraced a rights-based approach, and China has prioritised sovereignty and security, said Simon Chesterman, a senior director at AI Singapore, the lead government programme.
 Singapore has taken a different path.
 “For small jurisdictions like Singapore, the challenge is how to avoid under-regulating – meaning you expose your ­citizens to risk – or over-­regulating, meaning you might drive innovation elsewhere and miss out on the opportunities,” he said.
 “In addition to this Goldilocks idea of regulation, there is a real willingness to partner with industry ... because industry standards and choices will always be the first line of defence against problems ­associated with AI,” he said.
 “It also increases the chances that Singapore can reap the benefits of the new knowledge economy.”
 The 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations’ guide to AI governance and ethics, released this month, recommends principles of transparency, fairness and equity, accountability and integrity, and “human-­centricity”.
 Yet member countries including Singapore, Cambodia and Myanmar have been criticised for using AI to enhance surveillance, including with facial recognition and crowd analytics systems, and patrol robots.
 A second edition of the AI Trailblazers project will be launched in Singapore this year, and help up to 150 more organisations build generative AI solutions for everyday ­challenges, Teo said.
 While these collaborations between the government, industry and academia can accelerate technological ­progress, there are risks, warned Ausma Bernot, a researcher at Griffith University in Australia.
 “There is the possibility of becoming overly reliant on these corporations in the medium- to long-term,” she said.
 “The challenge is striking a balance between cooperation and maintaining sovereign ­control over critical AI infrastructure.”
 At the Trailblazers event, a short film on the People’s Association’s booking chatbot created a buzz of excitement.
 There were more than 140,000 badminton court bookings in 2022, so a tool that can help do it easily is welcome, said Weng Wanyi, director of the National AI Office.
 “It will save time and effort,” she said. “At the end of the day, it’s about solving real problems with technology.” – Thomson Reuters Foundation",badminton court odd community centre resident type time venue free slot artificial intelligence easier people community centre government tech agency chatbot generative artificial intelligence resident free court city official chatbot generative solution trailblazer solution project singapore government agency development tool scan job applicant customised teaching curriculum transcript customer service south east asian nation strategy light regulation keen josephine teo minister communication regulation governance infrastructure support activity month google singapore office tool aspect building capability people access tool opportunity skill enable tool teo explosion generative government curb harm election disinformation innovation potential economic benefit adoption public sector industry environment skill collaboration denise wong assistant chief executive infocomm medium development authority oversees country digital strategy regulation ecosystem critical public thomson reuters ecosystem company comfortable innovation deploy safe responsible brings trust responsible aiwith stable business environment top global innovation strength institution human capital infrastructure adopter national strategy aim individual business community confidence discernment trust generative tool court school government agency national strategy mission public singapore singapore verify foundation testing tool responsible generative sandbox trialing product imda technology company microsoft google salesforce primary toolkit code platform github drawn local global company user parameter gender representation cultural representation nudge outcome test firm huawei toolkit racial bias data test ubs bank reminder data affect model fairness imda enable government wong goldilocks policy strategy country economic operation development oecd opted market model minimal regulation europe right approach china sovereignty security simon chesterman senior director singapore lead government programme path jurisdiction challenge avoid expose citizen risk drive innovation opportunity addition goldilocks idea regulation real willingness partner industry industry standard choice defence increase chance reap benefit economy association east asian nation governance ethic month principle transparency fairness equity accountability integrity human centricity country singapore cambodia myanmar enhance surveillance facial recognition crowd analytics system robot edition trailblazer singapore organisation generative solution everyday challenge collaboration government industry academia accelerate technological progress risk bernot researcher griffith university possibility reliant corporation term challenge balance cooperation sovereign control critical infrastructure trailblazer event short film people chatbot buzz excitement badminton court booking weng wanyi director national office save time effort day real technology thomson reuters,"[(2, 0.99748254)]",2
655615,StarBiz 7,6,02/03/2024,Nvidia: The mother of  all artificial intelligence,,"NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), one of the greatest stock market finds in recent times continues to defy the odds, with not only mind-blowing share price performance but one that is backed by fundamentals.
 The company is a leader in high-end graphic processing units (GPUs) semiconductor chips with a staggering 75% global market share. These chips enable artificial intelligence (AI) applications as well as machine learning capabilities, which is today’s buzzword in the technology industry. 
 But it is not that NVDA was born yesterday that it has now reached the pinnacle of success but the company itself has been around for more than three decades. 
 Founded by three computer scientists including its current owner, Jensen Huang, in 1993, the company went public in 1999 and focused on graphic-based computing and video games. 
 NVDA’s biggest breakthrough was just a couple of years ago when ChatGPT’s generative AI chatbot was released to the public, which is powered by 10,000 NVDA GPUs. 
 Not only that, but these GPUs are also an important part of data centres, a business that is now a dominant part of NVDA’s success. 
 A blowout quarter
 For the recently released fourth-quarter (4Q) 2023, NVDA reported a staggering 263% growth in revenue to US$22.1bil, well ahead of the market forecast, while earnings per share leap-frogged almost five-fold to US$5.16, marginally ahead of the street forecast. 
 Data centre revenue alone accounted for more than 80% of the quarterly revenue as revenue surged 409% to US$18.4bil! Another interesting take from its quarterly announcement is how dominant NVDA is in the business as gross margins hit 76.7% in the quarter. 
 According to NVDA’s website, the company’s business model is now being fuelled by multiple demand drivers and this includes demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialised ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer Internet companies, vertical industries, led by automotive, financial services, and healthcare sectors. 
 One of NVDA’s products, the NVIDIA RTX, which was introduced less than six years ago, is now a massive PC platform for generative AI, enjoyed by more than 100 million gamers and creators. 
 Sustainable – for now
 Post-4Q23 earnings, NVDA guided an even stronger 1Q24 with revenue at US$24bil – almost 10% above the consensus estimate while gross margins are expected to be maintained at the 77% range. 
 The question on investors’ minds is of course whether NVDA can continue to grow exponentially and at the same time maintain its sky-high margins. 
 NVDA has clearly demonstrated an incredible growth trajectory. Given the undeniable potential and necessity of AI across various industries, and considering NVDA’s leading position in the market, its unique competitive advantages and partnerships, and its technological prowess, it’s reasonable to assume that the company will continue to experience robust growth.
 An AI bubble?
 NVDA, which has rallied almost 57% this year alone, and more than five-bagger since the start of 2023, has reached an unprecedented valuation with a total market capitalisation of close to US$2 trillion, which is even larger than Russia’s annual gross domestic product. 
 It is now the world’s fourth most valuable company after Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco, and ahead of other larger tech names like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. 
 Post-4Q earnings, NVDA added US$272bil in market capitalisation alone – making it the single largest one-day value gain ever. 
 Trading at a trailing forward 12-month price-earnings ratio of about 37 times, NVDA is no longer a cheap stock relative to earnings growth but most analysts have maintained a “strong buy” call with a 12-month forward price target of about US$850 – approximately 8% upside from its current price. 
 NVDA is not alone in the business that it is in and there are other market players which include companies like Intel and AMD, while hyperscalers, including cloud service providers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are also developing and using application-specific integrated circuits, build for their own specific AI needs. 
 With the world moving towards innovation and technology-driven solutions, the market capitalisation of these companies has simply gone exponential. 
 However, as more companies enter the market providing solutions similar to or in competition with NVDA, mainly due to the super-normal profits that the company is presently enjoying, NVDA’s future profit growth will slow and margins can only trend lower. 
 Super margins don’t last
 Making more than 75 US cents to the US dollar is insane for any business and bound to attract competition. The competition may take time to establish itself but sooner or later this will eat into the incumbent’s huge market share. 
 Take Tesla for example, which can be said to have revolutionised the automotive sector with its electric car offering but competition coming from other automotive companies, especially those from China, has seen Tesla reducing its selling prices and its margins have dropped from a high of almost 30% to less than 18% in the latest quarter. 
 Locally, the pandemic too had taught us a lesson as the surge in demand for rubber gloves drove prices to the roof, and companies in the sector saw gross margins surge from below 20% to as high as 70%-80% but turned negative in recent quarters due to lower average selling price and subdued demand. 
 In both of the above examples, the share price of Tesla today is half of what it was at the peak, and in our local example, the share price of our glove companies has more or less collapsed by as much as 90%. 
 Given the above scenario, while NVDA is now the darling stock of the US stock market and perhaps to a larger extent having a spillover effect on other stocks, the end is near for the share price to peak and when the first evidence of lower gross profit margin and slowing topline growth kicks in, investors will be in for a rough downhill ride.

655642,StarBiz 7,12,02/03/2024,Wall Street hunts for more AI gold post-Nvidia rally,,"MONEY managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market’s interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as a stunning rally by Nvidia sparks a search for other companies that are capitalising on the technology.
 Shares of Nvidia – whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry – are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. 
 The run has pushed its market value to roughly US$2 trillion, making it the third-largest US company by market cap after Microsoft and Apple.
 It has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves.
 Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.
 “It’s not a fad,” said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments’ Large Cap Focused Fund.
 “There are too many cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.”
 Excitement over AI helped power the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.
 Further signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank’s analysts have estimated AI technology could add 1.5 percentage points to US productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.
 A Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is “a Year of Investment for AI,” the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.
 Bido’s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and MongoDB, whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs. — Reuters",money manager cash stock market artificial intelligence rally search company technology share chip standard industry pushed market largest company market cap microsoft apple wall street search company move investor chip industry betting firm chain stay francisco bido senior portfolio manager investment fund company technology top bottom line excitement power composite record thursday record index sign fixation easy spot mention conference call fourth quarter goldman bank analyst technology add percentage productivity growth widespread adoption decade morgan survey chief officer investment bank note week cio machine top priority time bido fund play rival chipmaker micro device database product change data infrastructure reuters,"[(0, 0.15338913), (6, 0.8389814)]",6
655142,StarBiz,10,01/03/2024,Alibaba unveils big cloud price cuts on AI rivalry,,"Beijing: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is rolling out its second major cost cuts for cloud services in years, aiming to win back users from rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd competing to provide the tools critical to training artificial intelligence (AI).
 The Chinese internet pioneer slashed prices starting yesterday on scores of internet-based products and services by as much as 55%, and by 20% on average. 
 The discounts span more than 100 product specifications, including data storage and elastic computing products that provide online processing power to clients, Alibaba executives said during a briefing.
 The cuts mark one of the more aggressive moves by Alibaba to regain leadership from Tencent and Baidu Inc in the cloud business, which is essential in the development of generative AI. 
 The price cuts come after Alibaba called off a spin-off and initial public offering for the formerly fast-growing unit.
 It’s now focusing on growing the public cloud – the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers – given US sanctions curtailing the supply of advanced chips to Chinese firms. Chief executive officer Eddie Wu has taken direct control of the unit and revamped major lines.
 Alibaba has struggled over the past year to revamp its vast eCommerce, logistics and cloud empire in the face of fierce competition and geopolitical risks. 
 The company announced cuts from 15%-50% for core products of the Alibaba Cloud in April last year, in a move aimed at capitalising on the demand for raw computing power needed for AI models such as Alibaba’s own Tongyi Qianwen.
 “We see tremendous growth prospects of China’s digital market,” Liu Weiguang, president of the unit’s public cloud segment, said in the statement. 
 “That’s why we decided to launch the price reduction campaign to lower the threshold of cloud services for more enterprises and developers to reap the technological dividends and accelerate the adoption of advanced public cloud services across various industries in China.” — Bloomberg",major cost cut service win user tencent holding provide tool critical training artificial intelligence chinese internet pioneer price yesterday score product service average discount span product specification data storage elastic computing product online processing power client executive cut aggressive move leadership tencent baidu cloud business essential development generative price cut alibaba spin initial public offering unit public cloud domestic service arm enterprise customer sanction supply advanced chip chinese firm chief executive officer direct control unit major line revamp vast ecommerce logistics empire fierce competition geopolitical risk company cut core product cloud april move demand raw power model tongyi tremendous growth prospect digital market liu president unit public cloud segment statement launch price reduction campaign threshold cloud service developer technological dividend accelerate adoption public cloud service industry bloomberg,"[(6, 0.9927667)]",6
654760,Lifestyle,14,29/02/2024,Evaluating a dog’s personality with AI,,"ASSISTANCE dogs can be trained to accompany people with visual, hearing, motor or psychological impairments or disabilities. But some dogs are more suited to this task than others. American and British researchers have created an innovative tool to help trainers spot them.
 Scientists at the University of East London and the University of Pennsylvania have developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that evaluates a dog’s personality. The tool is based on data from almost 8,000 Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaires (C-BARQ). 
 For over 20 years, this test has been a benchmark in the evaluation of potential working dogs.
 But some of the 100 questions that make up the C-BARQ are subjective, which can bias the results of the questionnaire. 
 Artificial intelligence can remedy this problem by “adjust(ing) for outlying responses”, as James Serpell, a professor of ethics and animal welfare emeritus at the UPenn School of Veterinary Medicine, explains in a news release.
 The algorithm devised by Professor Serpell and colleagues groups the C-BARQ results into five main categories: “Excitable/attached”, “anxious/fearful”, “aloof/predatory”, “reactive/assertive” and “calm/agreeable”. These categories give an idea of a pooch’s personality and, therefore, of its professional potential.
 After all, assistance dogs need to be able to perform different actions and adapt to any environment to help their owners on a daily basis. They need to be patient and have good stress management skills. 
 This is why trainers prefer calm dogs who are docile by nature. Generally speaking, a dog with a strong character will be much harder to train.
 The researchers are convinced of the potential of their canine personality test algorithm, although they consider that more research is required. 
 “The novel AI-based methodology in this research may be    useful in the future to enhance the selection and training of dogs for specific working and non- working roles,” the scientists write in a paper, published in the journal Nature.
 Indeed, while this AI software has been designed to facilitate the selection of future assistance dogs, it could also be used in shelters to reduce the likelihood of adoptive families reconsidering their choice because they don’t get on with their new canine companion. – AFP Relaxnews",assistance dog accompany people visual motor psychological impairment disability dog task american british researcher innovative tool trainer scientist university london university pennsylvania artificial intelligence algorithm dog personality tool data canine behavior assessment barq test benchmark evaluation potential dog question subjective bias artificial intelligence remedy response james ethic animal welfare emeritus upenn school veterinary medicine news release algorithm professor serpell colleague main category excitable anxious fearful aloof predatory reactive assertive calm agreeable category idea personality professional potential assistance dog action environment owner daily basis patient stress management trainer calm dog docile nature dog strong character harder train researcher potential canine personality test algorithm methodology future enhance selection dog specific role scientist paper journal nature software facilitate selection future assistance dog shelter likelihood adoptive family choice canine companion afp relaxnews,"[(2, 0.586939), (3, 0.40702066)]",2
654454,Main,11,28/02/2024,LEADING THE INDUSTRY WITH EMERGING AI TECH,AIA Malaysia is leveraging on AI to increase efficiencies and improve customer experience,"FEAR, distrust and misconceptions towards artificial intelligence (AI) is prominent in all industries, including the insurance sector.
 Even some insurance professionals may be apprehensive as they believe AI and automation may be a threat to their livelihood. 
 Visions of robots developing human personalities and taking over the world, have bled from the world of science fiction into our daily reality, colouring our perception of AI and the value it can bring to our everyday life. 
 But the fact of the matter is,  AI is here to stay. However, in AIA, AI is seen as an enabler rather than a replacer. 
 “We’re constantly looking for ways to elevate our customer experience and improve the business interactions of our Life Planners (agents),” shares AIA Malaysia chief executive officer Ben Ng.
  “As emerging technologies reshape the world and consumer behaviour and expectations evolve, it is imperative for companies like us to move forward and continuously improve our capabilities.
 “We started to explore the use of AI to focus on the easing of processes, with the ultimate goal of creating a more seamless and convenient experience for our customers and Life Planners,” adds AIA Malaysia chief agency distribution officer Leong Chee Soong.
 Noting that the company has focused heavily on digitisation in the past four years, Ng says the company has relied heavily on data insights and analytics to increase efficiencies. 
 “We have invested a lot of time, effort and funds into technology and data analytics as technology allows us to have efficient, meaningful and personalised engagements with our customers and Life Planners,” says Ng. 
 Leong concurs, saying that the insurer utilises AI to ultimately streamline operations, and build a higher quality team of Life Planners who embrace their role as professional health and wealth advisors to customers.  
 “This in turn translates into higher trust from our customers – who are the centre of everything we do. After over 75 years of doing business in Malaysia, AIA wants to enable people to be the best versions of themselves, supported by our wide range of Total Health and Wealth Solutions and various services.”
 Revolutionising agency recruitment with AI Virtual interviews are incredibly convenient and timesaving for both hiring managers and candidates. But imagine, virtual interviews conducted by AI? It gives new meaning to the phrase: anytime and anywhere. 
 AIA Malaysia’s newly launched platform, AI Recruiter, features an AI Interview function which allows AIA to interview candidates to join its agency force in a convenient and efficient manner - using AI to schedule interviews which can take place virtually at any time of the day.
 The interview, fully conducted by AI, will then assess the responses and recommend the next course of action for AIA to take.
 It helps the insurer attract a wider talent pool, screen and filter a large number of candidates in a short duration of time, as well as reduce the hassle of scheduling.
 As for the potential candidates? They get to control where and when the interview takes place – giving them time to prepare, familiarise themselves and be comfortable before the interview.  
 AIA is the first insurer in Malaysia to introduce AI into its agency recruitment process which was developed to complement the company’s recruitment programme, AIA Elite Academy. 
 With the development of the AI Interview feature, AIA is now able to consume big data and analyse large datasets to make informed and real time recommendations to agency leaders in terms of their candidate’s likelihood of success in AIA’s Elite Academy programmes.
 AIA Elite Academy was launched in 2018 as an exclusive and first-of-its kind recruitment programme geared at developing a new generation of high performing Life Planners.
 The programme prides itself on a time-proven syllabus that features best-in-class training, and the necessary tools and skill sets that empowers AIA Life Planners to grow professionally and be successful entrepreneurs.  
 Leong shares that the AI system looks beyond the candidate’s background in terms of demographics, education, experience, and analyses their motivation level, adaptability to different environments, networking ability as well as a host of competencies and soft skills that can boost chances to succeed in this industry. 
 “The AI Interview eliminates unconscious human biases that may be present in any face-to-face interviews in any recruitment setting. This helps our agency leaders (recruiters) assess candidates in a neutral, impartial and a more holistic way prior to joining the company.
 “However, we do not take the AI’s decision as the final say. We will still assess and review their recommendation as the final decision lies with us,” says Leong.
 He adds that the entire process is simple and straightforward to navigate. The candidate begins by selecting either English, Bahasa Malaysia or Mandarin to begin the process. They would then have to answer a series of questions that will vary according to their work experience. Candidates are allowed to practise and review their answers before submitting. 
 It takes at most one day for candidates to complete the interview as opposed to the previous average turnaround time of eight days. Furthermore, agency leaders can view the interview results within an hour after the interview is completed.
 “While the implementation of AI Interview is still in its early days, we found that Elite Pro Life Planners (the highest segment of AIA Elite Academy recruits) who have gone through the AI Recruiter platform were 1.5 times more productive than those who went through traditional face-to-face interviews – demonstrating positive results even in its initial stages,” says Leong.
 He adds that AIA Malaysia has noticed a hike in quality hires and operations efficiency since launching its AI-based recruitment process in August last year.
 Meet Aisya and Alexis
 The increased awareness on how conversational chatbots have revolutionised and boosted customer service led AIA Malaysia to rollout another AI feature – AI Talk Bots dubbed ALEXIS for its conventional business and AISYA for its takaful - as part of its efforts to improve customers’ digital experiences.
 But AIA Malaysia isn’t merely implementing the AI feature for its own convenience. The insurer is actually ensuring that customers have positive experiences, while making sure their insurance coverage remains uninterrupted. The AI Talk Bot will contact customers with gentle reminders that their policy is due for payment.
 “AI Talk Bots have significantly expanded AIA’s customer outreach, enabling over 3,000 calls per day collectively. In 2022, AIA’s Customer Contact team achieved 12% of their attempted outreach to customers for policy payment reminders.
 In comparison, since the launch of the AI Talk Bots, the attempted customer reach has increased by three folds in just four months,” shares Ng.
 Capable of more than just a recorded message, the AI Talk Bots offer a personalised experience for each customer, holding all the relevant account information for them during the call to respond to their queries when asked in real-time. 
 “79% of AIA customers have completed their payments within 24 hours after receiving a call since the deployment of AI Talk Bots,” adds Ng. 
 “The algorithm of our database enables the system to provide customers with prompt, consistent and timely human-like conversations, contributing to an overall improved experience. 
 In the near future, we are looking at expanding the AI Talk Bot’s functionality for more complex customer-related reminders and interactions like inactive policies reminders and welcome calls,” says Ng.
 Identifying customer triggers
 As the main feature in AIA’s Life Planner App (ALPA) one-stop platform, Leong notes that the AI-powered Customer360° empowers Life Planners to have a complete view of their customers and even identifies significant event triggers across a customer’s life stages. 
 This allows them to easily identify and prioritise customers who may require additional protection coverage and initiate timely conversations. “Since Customer360°’s launch, over one (1) million customers have been tagged by the AI models in ALPA.
 “This has led to an increase in existing customers opting to repurchase an insurance or takaful plan from AIA – after being approached by their Life Planners,” Ng points out.
 Leong notes that this feat can only be achieved through meaningful engagements and a deeper understanding which then enables the Life Planners to customise and carefully craft needs-based solutions for their customers.
 “Our Life Planners need not carry a single piece of paper to keep track of their customers’ needs - in line with our environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts as well.”
 He explains that Customer360° gives AIA Life Planners indicators derived from its in-house propensity model to help them address specific event triggers in a customer’s life cycle, which helps Life Planners be more efficient and targeted in their outreach.

654076,StarBiz,9,27/02/2024,AI explodes data centre energy use,Experts say a Google-created technique may help,"NEW YORK: Tech giants are racing to ward off a carbon time bomb caused by the massive data centres they’re building around the world.
 A technique pioneered by Google is gaining currency as more power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) comes online: Using software to hunt for clean electricity in parts of the world with excess sun and wind on the grid, then ramping up data centre operations there.
 Doing so could cut carbon and costs.
 There’s an urgent need to figure out how to run data centres in ways that maximise renewable energy usage, said Chris Noble, co-founder and chief executive officer of Cirrus Nexus, a cloud-computing manager tapping data centres owned by Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
 The climate risks sparked by AI-driven computing are far-reaching – and will worsen without a big shift from fossil fuel-based electricity to clean power. 
 Nvidia Corp chief executive officer Jensen Huang has said AI has hit a “tipping point.” He has also said that the cost of data centres will double within five years to power the rise of new software.
 Already, data centres and transmission networks each account for up to 1.5% of global consumption, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
 Together, they’re responsible for emitting about as much carbon dioxide as Brazil annually.
 Hyperscalers – as the biggest  data centre  owners like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are known – have all set climate goals and are facing internal and external pressure to deliver on them.
 Those lofty targets include decarbonising their operations. 
 But the rise of AI is already wreaking havoc on those goals. 
 Graphics processing units have been key to the rise of large language models and use more electricity than central processing units used in other forms of computing.
 Training an AI model uses more power than 100 households in a year, according to IEA estimates. 
 “The growth in AI is far outstripping the ability to produce clean power for it,” he said.
 Moreover, AI’s energy consumption is volatile and more akin to a sawtooth graph than a smooth line that most data centre  operators are used to. That makes decarbonisation a challenge, to say nothing of ensuring grid stability. 
 AI’s growth is being driven by North American companies, keeping computing power – and energy usage – concentrated there, said Dave Sterlace, account director for global data centres at Hitachi Energy. 
 That’s a trend he didn’t expect two years ago. 
 Load shifting
 To lower data centre CO2 emissions, hyperscalers and other  data centre  providers have financed massive amounts of solar or wind farms and used credits to offset emissions.
 In the case of credits, some have failed to have a meaningful impact on emissions. 
 But that alone won’t be enough, especially as AI use ticks up.
 That’s why operators are turning to the strategy employed by Alphabet Inc unit Google called load shifting. The idea: Lower emissions by upending the way data centres function. 
 Today, most data centres seek to operate in a “steady state,” such that their energy consumption is fairly stable. 
 That leaves them at the mercy of the grid they’re connected to and whatever the day’s mix of natural gas, nuclear and renewable power generation is given the lack of transmission lines between regions. 
 To break their reliance on dirtier grids, tech giants are looking for opportunities to shift daily or even hourly  data centre   operations around the world in an effort to soak up excess renewable energy production.
 Google launched the first effort to match its power usage at certain data centres with zero-carbon power on an hourly basis in a bid to get its machines running on clean energy 24/7.
 No one has fully achieved that goal yet. 
 And, to be sure, the strategy of shifting loads around the world might be complicated by countries pushing for data sovereignty policies that attempt to restrict and safeguard the flow of data across borders. 
 But what Cirrus Nexus and Google are testing could still be a critical piece of the puzzle for cutting emissions. 
 Manhattan-based Cirrus Nexus scours the world’s power grids and measures emissions in five-minute increments to find the least polluting computing resources for itself and its clients in industries that range from pharmaceuticals to accounting.
 The company had a chance to put that search into practice last summer.
 The Netherlands was in the midst of its sunniest June on record, causing the cost of solar power on the grid to drop. That made it cheaper and less carbon-intensive to run servers. 
 Cirrus Nexus then shifted its computing load to California once the sun went down in the Netherlands, allowing it to draw on solar power just coming online for the day in the Golden State.  
 By chasing the sun from Europe to the US West Coast and back again, the company was able to slash computing emissions for certain workloads for itself and clients by 34% rather than relying on servers in either location alone, according to company data shared with Bloomberg Green.
 Making operations flexible to do that comes with both benefits and risks. Being able to pursue spare zero-carbon megawatts can help reduce stress on grids, such as during a heat wave or frigid winter storm. Blackout worry
 But data centres need to cooperate with utilities and grid operators because big swings in demand can throw electric systems into disarray, boosting the odds of blackouts. 
 Dominion Energy, which is seeing  data centre   demand soar at its Virginia utility, is working on a programme to harness load shifting at data centres to ease stress on the grid during extreme weather.
 In recent years, Google and Amazon have tested shifting  data centre  use for their own operations and for clients that use their cloud services. Cirrus Nexus, for instance, uses cloud services offered by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. 
 In Virginia, Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy Corp  that guarantees more than 90% of the power for its area  data centre  will be zero-carbon energy.
 Reaching 100%, though, remains a formidable goal for it and other hyperscalers.
 Google’s data centres run on carbon-free energy about 64% of the time, with 13 of the regional sites getting to 85% and seven at just over 90% globally, said Michael Terrell, who leads Google’s 24/7 carbon-free energy strategy. 
 “But if you’re not displacing fossil assets, then you’re not completely achieving your climate goals,”  said Terrell. — Bloomberg",york tech giant ward carbon time bomb massive data centre building technique google gaining currency power hungry artificial intelligence online software hunt clean electricity excess sun wind grid data centre operation carbon cost urgent figure data centre renewable energy usage chris noble founder chief executive officer cirrus nexus cloud computing manager data centre google microsoft amazon climate risk worsen shift fossil fuel electricity clean power nvidia corp chief executive officer jensen huang cost data centre double power rise software data centre transmission network global consumption international energy agency iea responsible carbon dioxide hyperscalers biggest data centre owner microsoft amazon climate goal internal external pressure deliver lofty target operation rise havoc goal graphic unit key rise language model electricity central unit form training model power household estimate growth ability clean power energy consumption volatile akin sawtooth data centre operator challenge grid stability growth north american company power energy usage dave sterlace account director global data centre energy trend load lower data centre emission hyperscalers data centre provider massive amount solar wind farm credit emission credit meaningful impact emission tick operator strategy unit google load idea lower emission data centre data centre operate steady energy consumption stable leaf grid day natural gas nuclear renewable power generation lack transmission line region reliance dirtier grid tech giant opportunity data centre operation effort soak excess renewable energy production google effort match power usage data centre power hourly basis bid machine clean energy goal strategy load country data sovereignty policy restrict safeguard flow data border nexus google critical piece puzzle emission cirrus nexus power grid measure emission increment resource client industry pharmaceutical company chance search practice summer midst sunniest june record cost solar power grid drop cheaper carbon intensive server load california sun solar power online day golden chasing sun europe coast company slash emission client server company data bloomberg green operation flexible benefit risk spare carbon megawatt stress grid heat frigid winter storm blackout data centre utility operator swing throw electric system disarray odds blackout dominion energy data centre demand virginia utility programme harness load data centre stress grid extreme weather google amazon data centre operation client service nexus instance cloud service amazon microsoft google virginia microsoft deal constellation energy corp guarantee power data centre carbon energy remains formidable goal hyperscalers data centre free energy time regional site lead carbon free energy strategy fossil asset climate goal,"[(0, 0.37339237), (4, 0.62473494)]",4
653364,StarHealth,5,25/02/2024,What AI really is,"Is artificial intelligence a boon or bane to humanity, especially when it comes to healthcare?","EVERYBODY wants Artificial Intelligence (AI), and everybody wants it now. 
 As with most hype, it is worth taking a step back to understand what AI is, and perhaps just as importantly, what it is (or is not) suitable for. 
 The term “Artificial Intelli-gence” was coined in 1955 by Professor John McCarthy of Stanford University in the United States, who defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”.
 The concept has evolved to one in which machines simulate human intelligence in areas such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making. 
 These are done via algorithms and data analysis – the ability to recognise patterns, as well as provide analysis and insight that mimic the functions associated with human intelligence.
 What is a good AI?
 Just as how a human brain has certain prerequisites in order to function well, there are various factors that determine success in an AI.
 AI algorithms require high- quality and diverse datasets for proper training. 
 Narrow AI – i.e. where AI is used for one particular thing, e.g. AI for website chatbots – may not require as large a dataset, but still requires quality input.
 The basics are important – the data used to train AI must be of sufficient quality and with minimal bias. 
 Poor input will lead to poor output. 
 The data itself should be collected in a way that builds on trust, and should adhere to privacy and ethical guidelines.
 After data collection, the next steps are calculations – the processing of large datasets and the training of complex models that require very high computational resources. 
 High-performance processors accelerate the training and inference processes, enabling faster and more efficient computations.
 The need for such processing power is the driving force behind the high valuation of Nvidia, one of the top tech companies with a market capitalisation at more than US$1.8 trillion (RM8.6 trillion, at the time of writing).
 Dealing with datasets and AI require appropriate skillsets. 
 These include expertise in machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. 
 Researchers and data scientists have to design and optimise algorithms to achieve specific goals, such as classification, regression, clustering or reinforcement learning, depending on the application domain and task requirements.
 Specific domain expertise is crucial in understanding the context and utilisation of AI in specific sectors, e.g. healthcare professionals for AI in medicine, financial analysts for AI in finance, etc. 
 This is important to ensure that mistakes are minimised and results can be utilised in real-world contexts.
 All of the above can – and should – only be allowed if there is adherence to ethical principles and regulatory standards. 
 This is to ensure fairness, transparency, accountability and privacy protection. 
 Ethical AI frameworks promote responsible AI practices, mitigate biases and address societal implications. 
 This is the rationale for the European Union introducing its AI Act, the first major legislation that codifies AI protections into law.
 The advantages of AI
 The primary value of an AI is the ability to process and analyse vast amounts of data at speed far beyond that of the human mind.
 This is particularly useful in repetitive or mundane tasks, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex and creative endeavours.
 AI can also analyse complex datasets to identify patterns, trends and correlations that may not be apparent to humans. 
 Future outcomes and trends can be identified by analysing historical data and identifying predictive patterns. 
 At a more granular level, AI systems can perform tasks with a high degree of accuracy and precision, often surpassing human capabilities. 
 In fields such as medical diagnosis, radiological image recognition and quality control, AI algorithms can achieve levels of accuracy that are difficult for humans to replicate consistently.
 At a more personal level, AI algorithms can tailor experiences and recommendations to individual preferences and behaviours. 
 In fields such as ecommerce, entertainment and healthcare, personalised recommendations based on AI analysis can enhance customer satisfaction and engagement.
 The downside of AI
 One of the primary criticisms of AI is the potential for bias; AI learns from historical data, which may contain biases inherent in the data and the collection process. 
 If this data reflects societal biases or systemic inequalities, AI algorithms can perpetuate, and even exacerbate them. 
 There are various examples of biased training data leading to discriminatory outcomes in loan approvals, and even court decisions.
 The algorithms are also complex with minimal transparency and interpretability. 
 It is not wrong to say that very few people actually understand what happens with an AI, and for the majority of us, it is very important to be cognisant of what we do not know – there is no room to blindly trust or apportion infallibility to an AI without knowing how it arrives at a decision, especially without accountability, fairness and trust.
 The increasing ubiquity, overreliance and dependency on AI can lead to complacency and a lack of critical thinking. 
 One must not overlook the errors, biases and limitations of AI, such as its inability to make decisions based on moral or value judgements.
 AI in healthcare
 Given the context above, one can start to imagine the opportunities and limitations of AI in enhancing healthcare delivery.
 Healthcare is rich in data: symptoms can be analysed for diagnosis, treatment can be identified at genetic level, AI-powered remote devices can monitor signs, algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify potential drug candidates – the list goes on.
 However, it is not a panacea and should be recognised as such.
 There is bias within algorithms, data privacy and security concerns, misinterpretation of data within training modules that are not properly validated, overreliance on technology by practitioners, increasing inequality due to cost considerations – once again, the list goes on.
 AI is changing the world, even as it is changing in its own nature over time. 
 There is tremendous potential, but this has to be viewed alongside the challenges of data privacy, bias and regulatory issues to ensure that AI is implemented ethically and responsibly in all its settings, including healthcare. 
 As I wrote at the start of this column, it is worth taking a step back to understand what AI is, and just as importantly, what it is not.

653414,Lifestyle,5,25/02/2024,What’s the real threat of AI?,Maybe it’s not an army of robots. Maybe it’s AI simply making life so easy that we lose the motivation to live.,"EARLIER this week, Open AI – the creators of ChatGPT, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) that, as we all know, is coming for our jobs – released Sora, a text to video app that “dances on the edge of reality and dreams” – or so says Microsoft Co-pilot, an AI that is powered by ChatGPT.
 But to put it simply, Sora looks incredible.
 Puppies playing in the snow, a woman waking up with her cat licking her, landscape shots of a pre-war Swiss village – if someone didn’t tell me all of it was generated by AI, I would have no clue.
 And keep in mind 10 months ago the best we could do with text to video was a warped and morphing version of Will Smith eating noodles like an AI generated monster (if you haven’t seen it, look it up and prepare to feel nauseous). As I’ve said before, AI is progressing faster than any tech we’ve ever built.
 Which is great. AI is going to be a terrific tool for productivity – it already is in an increasing number of fields. 
 And when people talk about AI companies they’re really not looking at it correctly; it’s like calling companies “Internet companies” back in the early 2000s. Would you call any company an Internet company now? They’re all Internet companies. The Internet is table stakes. That’s what AI is going to be. Every company will use AI in some capacity.
 But this particular aspect of AI, this text to video technology, is incredible. And it has vast implications for the industry I work in, namely film and TV. It’s a good thing SAG (Screen Actors Guild, the American actors union) went on strike last year and hopefully got some favourable terms to avoid human actors being replaced by AI – because that’s what watching Sora immediately makes me think.
 Actors are expensive. But they’re worth it because they pull in the audience. But what if we can now just generate an actor with the charisma of Brad Pitt, the biceps of Henry Cavil, and the cool of Timothy Chalamet? Finished.
 This is when text to video could conceivably get really good. Instead of watching stories about people and events that never really happened, we’ll be watching stories about people and events that never happened starring people that never existed.
 Then what happens when AI can write just as well or better than human writers? It will never happen, people say. I say, never say never. And look at how good AI has become in two years. I see it as inevitable. At some point in my lifetime, we will watch a fully AI-generated film from script to visuals to direction.
 Now let’s take this a little further.
 What if Netflix can read your face and tell what kind of film you want to watch? What if from this reading of your mood, AI generates a script, based on your preferences AI generates a cast for your film, and then AI executes all of this for your viewing pleasure?
 Now we’re all siloed and not even media brings us back together because I’m watching a film tailored to myself and so is everyone else watching things tailored to them. Maybe Netflix makes us the stars of the films we watch, depending on how narcissistic we are, maybe that’s a thing we want to see. We trick ourselves into believing we’re the heroes in the stories we watch.
 You might think this is farfetched, but I believe we’ll get there faster than we think. AI is going to bring a lot of good. It will make our lives easier in so many ways, its potential uses for improving healthcare and medicine is incredible. Actually, we’re already feeling its effects and have been for a few years, as AI and machine learning are already a part of many businesses.
 But the fears that AI will destroy our civilisation are still there, the idea that AI will rise up against humankind and build an army of robots to battle us. Maybe AI doesn’t have to do that to destroy our civilisation. Maybe all AI has to do is make it too easy for us to get what we want, and watch as we drift off into our own little bubbles and slowly die off. Maybe that’s the real threat of AI.

652246,StarMetro,10,22/02/2024,AI course partnership boon for state’s tech ambitions,"S’gor hopes to nurture talents in data analytics, machine learning","A total of 31 final-year  degree students graduated  from a course aimed at giving them intensive training in  data analytics and machine learning.
 The AI Nusantara programme at Universiti Selangor (Unisel) in Kuala Selangor was taught by Selangor Digital School (SDS).
 It is a collaboration between Selangor Information Technology and Digital Economy Cooperation (Sidec), which is a subsidiary of Invest Selangor Bhd, and The Hive Southeast Asia, which offers early-stage financing for startups.
 The month-long programme came with internship placements with 105 leading tech companies that have agreed to cooperate with Sidec and SDS.
 One of the students at the  graduation ceremony held at I-City in Shah Alam was Unisel computer science (industrial computing) student Aleeya Umairah Mohd Isa, 21.
 She said the AI Nusantara programme exposed her to apps used by consumers on a daily basis.  
 “It helped me learn beyond classroom walls,” she said.
 Currently serving her internship at a smart home solution and security company, Aleeya said she hoped to reach the level of the company’s top programmer who could not only write software but create new products as well.  
 Another graduate, Unisel information technology student Mas Nor Zalia Elisa Mat Zahid, 21, said she signed up for the free programme as she viewed it as an opportunity to get a jump start in the job market. 
 Guests of honour at the ceremony were Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari and state investment, trade and mobility committee chairman Ng Sze Han. 
 Also present was Sidec chief executive officer Yong Kai Ping, who said SDS aimed to nurture 600 talents this year. 
 “The programme is designed to address the shortage of workforce in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, particularly in digital marketing and prompt engineering. 
 “Our goal is to see these students working in leading tech companies and not end up in other fields,” said Yong.
 Ng, in his speech, said the programme was helping to create a tech-savvy workforce that would be much needed in smart cities. 
 Amirudin, who presented certificates to the graduates, said the programme was a step in the right direction towards Selangor developing its own technology hub with an aim to providing the private sector with a capable workforce.
 A memorandum of understanding stipulating the credits of cloud services between YTL Power International Bhd and SDS was also handed over during the ceremony.",total final degree student intensive training data analytics machine nusantara programme universiti selangor unisel kuala selangor selangor digital school sd collaboration selangor technology digital economy cooperation sidec subsidiary invest selangor bhd hive southeast asia stage financing startup month internship placement tech company cooperate sidec sd student graduation ceremony city shah alam unisel computer science industrial student aleeya umairah mohd isa nusantara programme apps consumer daily basis classroom wall internship smart solution security company aleeya level company top programmer write software create product graduate unisel technology student ma zalia zahid free programme opportunity jump job market ceremony selangor mentri besar datuk seri amirudin shari investment trade mobility committee chairman sze han sidec chief executive officer sd nurture talent address shortage workforce artificial intelligence field digital marketing prompt engineering goal student tech company speech programme tech savvy workforce smart city certificate graduate step direction selangor technology hub aim private sector capable workforce memorandum credit cloud service power international bhd sd ceremony,"[(3, 0.99409914)]",3
652302,StarBiz,14,22/02/2024,AI model backed by Asia’s richest person to  launch in March,,"MUMBAI: A consortium backed by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd and India’s top engineering schools aim to launch its first ChatGPT-style service next month.
 This is a big step in the country’s ambitions to become a player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
 The BharatGPT group, encompassing an arm of India’s most valuable company and eight affiliated universities, offered a sneak peek of the large language model on Tuesday during a technology conference in Mumbai. 
 In a video played before delegates, a motorcycle mechanic in southern India queried an AI bot in his native Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code.
 If successful, the model – dubbed Hanooman after the half-monkey Hindu deity – will represent an advance for India in the accelerating race to develop potentially transformative AI technology. 
 BharatGPT envisions the model working via 11 local languages in four main fields: health care, governance, financial services and education. 
 It developed the model in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology universities including in Bombay, backed by wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and India’s government. 
 A swath of startups such as Sarvam and Krutrim, backed by prominent venture capital investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and billionaire Vinod Khosla’s fund, are also building open-sourced AI models customised for India. 
 While Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI are building ever-larger large language models (LLMs), those efforts involve workarounds because of computational constraints and simpler models affordable to smaller businesses and government departments.
 “It’s a different genre of LLMs,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, chairman of IIT Bombay’s department of computer science and engineering.

652044,Main,4,21/02/2024,‘AI cannot replace journalists’,Fahmi: It lacks the human factor of interaction among people,"PUTRAJAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) cannot replace professional journalism due to its limitations and “lack of human heart”, says Fahmi Fadzil.
 The Communications Minister said the human factor of interacting between people was an important part of being a journalist that AI could not replicate.
 “Journalists’ jobs can never become redundant as while AI is able to chug out professional articles quickly, it lacks the personal connection and touch that only human journalists are able to incorporate into stories.
 “This includes things such as being able to have one-to-one interviews and the ability to express unique experiences when they travel to the site for the story.
 “AI is mostly only able to write about 60% of an article based on facts as the remaining parts can only be filled by the human mind with emotions and personal experiences,” he said here yesterday.
 Instead of doom, Fahmi suggests that journalists utilise AI to reduce their workload by helping to craft better stories with quicker and easier verifying of facts.
 To this, Fahmi said he plans to hold discussions with the Malaysian Press Institute on creating more AI training sessions and modules for journalists in the country.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi said there are no plans to allocate funds for “exclusive deals” that encourage popular foreign artistes to perform in the country.
 Such deals were handled entirely by private companies, he said, explaining that the government’s role was to approve applications by these companies.
 “Most of these exclusive concert events are organised and agreed upon between private companies that sign contracts to bring in artistes to perform in a single country at a region.”
 Citing an example, he said the concert by British rock band Muse in Malaysia last year was a result of discussions held among the organisers.
 Fahmi said his ministry would focus only on simplifying the approval procedures as there had been complaints about the slow process.
 “Any decision to allocate funding to bring in foreign artistes is entirely up to the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry,” he said.
 Fahmi was asked if the government would consider allocating funds to secure exclusivity deals with popular celebrities to perform in Malaysia.",putrajaya artificial intelligence professional journalism limitation human heart fahmi fadzil communication minister human factor people replicate journalist job chug professional article personal connection touch human journalist story interview ability unique experience site story write article human mind emotion personal experience yesterday doom fahmi journalist workload craft story easier fahmi plan discussion malaysian press institute training session journalist country plan allocate fund exclusive deal popular foreign artiste country deal private company government role application company exclusive concert event agreed private company contract artiste single country region concert british rock band muse malaysia result discussion organiser ministry focus approval procedure complaint slow process decision allocate funding foreign artiste tourism culture ministry fahmi government fund secure exclusivity deal popular celebrity malaysia,"[(3, 0.8705346), (4, 0.12338477)]",3
651358,StarBiz,6,19/02/2024,AI still useful in finance sector despite deepfake and bias risks,,"New York: A bank uses biased artificial intelligence (AI) outputs in a mortgage lending decision. An insurance firm’s AI produces racially homogeneous advertising images. Users of an AI system complain about a bad experience.
 These are just a few of the potential risks AI poses for financial institutions that want to embrace the emerging technology, according to a series of papers released last Thursday. 
 The papers, by FS-ISAC, a nonprofit that shares cyber intelligence among financial institutions around the world, highlights additional pitfalls as well, including deepfakes and “hallucinations,” when large language models provide incorrect information presented as facts.
 Despite those risks,  the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) outlines many potential uses for AI for financial firms, such as improving cyber defenses. The group’s work outlines the risks, threats and opportunities that artificial intelligence offers banks, asset managers, insurance firms and others in the industry.
 “It was taking our best practices, our experiences, our knowledge, and putting it all together, leveraging the insights from other papers as well,” said Mike Silverman, vice-president of strategy and innovation at FS-ISAC.
 AI is being used for malicious purposes in the financial sector, though in a fairly limited way. For instance, FS-ISAC said hackers have crafted more effective phishing emails, often refined through large language models like ChatGPT, intended to fool employees into leaking sensitive data. In addition, deepfake audios have tricked customers into transferring funds, Silverman said. 
 FS-ISAC also warned of data poisoning, in which data fed into AI models is manipulated to produce incorrect or biased decisions, and the emergence of malicious large language models that can be used for criminal purposes.
 Still, the technology can also be used to strengthen the cybersecurity of these firms, according to the reports. 
 Already, AI has shown to be effective in anomaly detection, or singling out suspicious, abnormal behavior in computer systems, Silverman said. 
 In addition, the technology can automate routine tasks such as log analysis, predict potential future attacks and analyze “unstructured data” from social media, news articles and other public sources to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, according to the papers. 
 To safely implement AI, FS-ISAC recommends testing these systems rigorously, continually monitoring them, and having a recovery plan in the case of an incident. — Bloomberg",york bank artificial intelligence output mortgage lending decision insurance firm homogeneous advertising image user system complain bad experience potential risk pose financial institution technology series paper thursday paper isac nonprofit share intelligence financial institution highlight additional pitfall deepfakes hallucination language model incorrect risk financial service analysis center isac potential financial firm cyber defense risk threat artificial intelligence offer bank asset manager insurance firm industry practice knowledge insight paper silverman vice president strategy innovation isac malicious purpose financial sector limited instance isac hacker effective phishing email language model fool employee sensitive data addition audio customer fund silverman isac data data model incorrect decision malicious language model criminal purpose technology cybersecurity firm effective anomaly detection suspicious abnormal behavior computer system silverman addition technology routine task analysis potential future attack unstructured data social medium news public source potential threat vulnerability paper implement isac system monitoring recovery plan incident bloomberg,"[(2, 0.4934982), (5, 0.50158554)]",5
651330,StarBiz,12,19/02/2024,OpenAI in investor deal valuing it at US$80bil,,"San Francisco: OpenAI has concluded a deal with investors that reportedly values the California start-up at US$80bil or more, after a roller-coaster year for the inventor of ChatGPT.
 The agreement, reported by The New York Times but not yet confirmed by OpenAI, would mean the value of the company – a world leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) – would have nearly tripled in under 10 months.
 The reported deal would have the San Francisco-based firm selling existing shares to investors led by Thrive Capital.
 It would permit executives and employees to sell shares at a highly favorable price, just three months after the firm survived a major crisis when company co-founder and chief executive Sam Altman was fired and then brought back only days later.
 OpenAI led a revolution in AI when it placed its ChatGPT programme online in late 2022.
 The immediate success of the interface sparked tremendous interest in the cutting-edge technology, capable of producing text, sounds and images upon demand.
 Microsoft, already an investor in the start-up, redoubled its involvement. The software giant has injected some US$13bil into OpenAI in the past few years.
 It is locked in fierce competition with Google to roll out new tools using AI’s generative abilities, to the point that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in January launched an investigation into the enormous investments by Microsoft, Google and Amazon in the specialised startups.
 OpenAI, founded as a non-profit in 2015, faced a major crisis last November.
 Its board fired chief executive officer Sam Altman, one of Silicon Valley’s more charismatic figures, accusing him of a lack of “transparence”.
 In the following days, Microsoft tried to hire him, while both executives and a majority of OpenAI employees demanded that those behind Altman’s ouster resign and that he be rehired.
 Within the week, Altman was back at work while several board members resigned.
 Last Friday, OpenAI – developer not only of ChatGPT but of image-generating DALL-E – released a new tool named “Sora,” which can create realistic videos of up to a minute on simple demand. — AFP",san francisco penai deal investor value roller coaster inventor chatgpt agreement york time openai company leader generative artificial intelligence month deal san francisco firm share investor thrive capital permit executive employee share favorable price month firm major crisis company founder chief executive sam altman brought day revolution chatgpt programme online late success interface tremendous edge technology capable text sound image microsoft investor start involvement software giant bil openai fierce competition google roll tool generative ability federal trade commission january investigation enormous investment microsoft google amazon startup profit major crisis november board chief executive officer altman silicon valley charismatic figure lack transparence day hire executive majority employee altman ouster resign week board friday developer chatgpt image dall tool sora create realistic video minute simple demand afp,"[(2, 0.9927013)]",2
651528,Lifestyle,5,19/02/2024,Anti-AI tool for artists,,"Unveiled last year and now available for download, Nightshade is a tool capable of “fooling” the artificial intelligence (AI) models currently used for automatic image generation.
 The idea is to help artists prevent their work from being misused without their knowledge or consent.
 Unless specifically blocked, generative AI models can now be trained on any content found on the Internet.
 This obviously poses a number of problems for artists and content creators who do not want their work to be used as part of the AI training process. 
 Effective solutions to “trick” these generative AI models include Nightshade.
 This tool has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of Chicago and is designed to enable artists to invisibly alter the pixels representing their work in order to disrupt AI models that are prone to using such images without authorisation in their learning process.
 Its creators even describe it as a veritable potential “poison pill” for these models, with serious malfunctions that could affect the training data and even render them unusable should such activity become widespread.
 The models referred to are those on which the best-known image-creating AIs, such as Midjourney and Dall-E, are based.
 In practice, these images would no longer be interpreted correctly, with a dog being mistaken for a cat, a house for a cake, and so on.
 Nightshade’s aim, ultimately, is not to disrupt AI models but to ensure that licensing images from their creators one day becomes the norm. The tool is now available to download from the university website.
 Nightshade joins Glaze, another solution the same researchers previously created that enables image manipulation so that models trained for AI do not pick them up.
 Of course, these tools will only be effective as long as these models are unable to detect, recognise and decode these manipulations.
 The day that AI is powerful enough to get past them, other solutions will need to be found. – AFP Relaxnews",unveiled download nightshade tool capable artificial intelligence model automatic image generation idea knowledge consent generative model content internet pose content creator process effective solution generative model tool team researcher university chicago enable artist pixel disrupt model image process creator veritable potential poison pill model malfunction data render unusable activity widespread model image ai midjourney dall practice image mistaken cat house cake nightshade aim disrupt model image creator day tool download university website nightshade glaze solution researcher enables image manipulation model pick tool effective model unable detect recognise decode manipulation day powerful solution relaxnews,"[(2, 0.990318)]",2
651163,Main,35,18/02/2024,Tech giants ink pact on AI deepfakes,Companies commit to detecting deceptive content that trick voters during polls,"MUNICH: Major technology companies signed a pact to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world.
 Executives from Adobe, Ama­zon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference on Friday to announce a new frame­work for how they respond to AI-generated deepfakes that deli­­berately trick voters. 
 Twelve other companies, inclu­ding Elon Musk’s X, are also signing on to the accord.
 “Everybody recognises that no one tech company, no one government, no one civil society organization is able to deal with the advent of this technology and its possible nefarious use on their own,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in an interview ahead of the summit.
 The accord is largely symbolic but targets increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video “that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote”.
 The companies are not committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content when it is created or distributed on their platforms. 
 It noted that the companies will share best practices with each other and provide “swift and proportionate responses” when that content starts to spread.
 The vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies. 
 But disappointed advocates were looking for stronger assurances.
 “The language isn’t quite as strong as one might have  expected,” said Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Centre. 
 “I think we should give credit where credit is due and acknowledge that the companies do have a vested interest in their tools not being used to undermine free and fair elections. 
 “That said, it is voluntary, and we’ll be keeping an eye on whether they follow through.”
 Clegg said each company “quite rightly has its own set of content policies”.
 “This is not attempting to try to impose a straitjacket on everybody,” he said. 
 “And in any event, no one in the industry thinks that you can deal with a whole new technological paradigm by sweeping things un­­der the rug, tr­ying to play whack-a-mole and fin­ding everything that you think may mislead someone.”
 Several political leaders from Europe and the United States also joined Friday’s announcement.
 European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said while such an agreement cannot be comprehensive, “it contains very impactful and positive elements”.
 She also urged fellow politicians to take responsibility in not using AI tools deceptively and warned that AI-fuelled disinformation could bring about “the end of democracy, not only in the EU member states”.

651160,StarEdu,4,18/02/2024,Building our ownAI talents,Tech crucial in realising Malaysia’s high-income ambition,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) education will play a significant role in Malaysia’s goal of becoming a high-income nation.
 This, said Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Faculty of Information Science and Technology senior lecturer Dr Lailatul Qadri Zakaria, is because AI can contribute to the country’s economic growth, innovation and competitiveness in many different ways.
 The adoption and deployment of AI technologies, she added, drive innovation and productivity across various economic sectors; transform manufacturing, healthcare, finance, agriculture and logistics industries; and address many of the social challenges we are currently facing.
 “Countries with a skilled AI workforce and supportive ecosystem are more likely to attract foreign investment and talent.
 “It also presents opportunities for Malaysian entrepreneurs and startups to develop innovative AI-driven solutions and create new businesses,” she said.
 The Academy of Sciences Malaysia, in a reply to StarEdu, said integrating AI into education and training programmes is vital for developing a skilled workforce capable of thriving in the digital economy. 
 “This not only addresses unemployment challenges but also positions Malaysia as a competitive player in emerging AI-related fields. 
 “Moreover, leveraging AI in public services, such as healthcare and transportation, can significantly improve efficiency and enhance the quality of life for citizens through smart city initiatives,” ASM said.
 Lailatul Qadri, who does research with AI, said those possessing a degree that specialises in AI will find it very easy to find a job upon graduating as they are part of an important talent pool for Malaysia. 
 AI, she added, opens many career opportunities across various industries.
 Indeed, such a degree can lead you to creating your own social media filter, a chatbot to answer texts automatically or even Malaysia’s own version of ChatGPT.
 “There is a high demand for AI experts globally. Data analysts, software developers, and AI ethics consultants are just some of the vacancies to fill,” Lailatul Qadri said, adding that many multinational companies and research institutions actively recruit AI talents from around the globe, offering opportunities for international collaboration and experience.
 The country’s efforts to develop research in the field of AI and to become a national and global research hub led to the conceptualisation of the UKM Centre for AI Technology in 2005.
 Lailatul Qadri said research groups at the centre focus on different areas such as data mining and optimisation, pattern recognition, knowledge technology, and vision system and mixed reality.
 The centre, she said, had also contributed to the drafting of the Malaysian AI Roadmap.Showing how serious the country is in growing our AI talent, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had also announced the establishment of Malaysia’s first AI Faculty in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) when tabling Budget 2024.
 The faculty will begin its academic programme this October at the university’s Kuala Lumpur campus, said UTM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Fauzi Ismail.
 “Some 120 students will be the faculty pioneers (and) start their lessons for the 2024/25 academic year in October.
 “The duration of their course will be about three years,” he said at the Skudai campus in January.
 Talent critical
 Asia Pacific University Of Technology & Innovation (APU) vice-chancellor Prof Dr Ho Chin Kuan said big tech companies like Tesla and Telekom need AI talent to design and build the applications.
 Besides big tech companies, he said banks were also using AI for fraud detection and customer loan disbursement.
 It is also being used to optimise field logistics, he added.
 While some jobs are becoming obsolete, Prof Ho said those with a degree in AI will always be in demand so long as there is automation.
 “Now, they are even looking into using AI to generate other AI,” he said.
 Prof Ho added that studying AI was not a top choice for school leavers a decade ago.
 “Back then, courses such as data science and software engineering were more popular,” he said, adding that today, the enrolment in AI programmes is shooting up across the board.
 “More are realising the need to learn AI which will lead to a continued rise in enrolment demand.
 “In fact, it is now a challenge for many universities to get good talent to come and teach AI,” Prof Ho said, adding that one needs passion to learn AI.
 He said the university started its AI programme back when there was a boom in cloud computing.
 This, he said, was necessary for AI as a normal computer would not be able to handle an AI workload.
 While interest in AI has been growing over the past few years, Prof Ho said it is not a recent innovation.
 “What’s happened now compared to 20 or 30 years ago is that the computing power has grown so much and it’s easier to achieve more functionalities for AI today,” he added.
 Prof Ho said APU offers a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a specialisation in AI.
 “Once students have mastered the basics (of computer science), we teach them how to incorporate intelligence when managing different modalities. 
 “For example, we teach students how to incorporate intelligence for recognising images just like what humans do. We teach students the technique of getting machines to understand text, image and sound data,” he said, adding that upon graduation, these students would be able to incorporate AI into all sorts of modalities.
 “The whole idea of the programme is to produce engineers who can design, develop, deploy and maintain AI systems,” said Prof Ho.
 Ultimately, he added, the idea is for the graduates to be technology developers.
 The university, like many other higher education institutions around the world, also incorporates AI-based subjects into its other degree programmes to create graduates who are technology users.
 This, said Prof Ho, is crucial as technology has a presence in a myriad of industries from engineering to finance and accounting.
 At UKM, there are two AI tracks offered to  undergraduates as part of the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science (Hons) programme, said Lailatul Qadri.
 They can choose between Data Science and Intelligent Machines which will be taught in their second year, she said.
 She said the number of students enrolled in the programme have been increasing over the years.
 Currently, there are 234 students in the programme.
 “The demand is very high and we have added seats but due to resource constraints, we cannot increase the spots by too much.
 “We cannot compromise quality for quantity,” she added.
 Lailatul Qadri said the faculty provides certain courses, such as Introduction to Information Technology that talks about basic AI, for students outside the faculty.
 Other faculties, such as the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, also conduct their own AI-based courses.
 “AI can be used across multiple disciplines, from computer science and engineering to healthcare, business, and social sciences. 
 “Integrating AI into courses across faculties can provide students with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills relevant to various career paths.
 “UKM is paying more attention to including AI into other programmes which aligns with global trends and the changing needs of the job market, research community, and society as a whole,” she added.
 Lailatul Qadri said that AI learning is very open nowadays.
 Even the government has launched “AI for Rakyat” (see infobox), a free module for Malaysians to learn the basic use and ethics of AI.
 “The resources are all available on the web for free,” she said, adding that what is needed is interest, patience and a strong foundation in mathematics.
 “Awareness of AI is so important right now so that people do not get scammed,” she said.
 Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology Department of Multimedia lecturer Prof Dr Rahmita Wirza O.K. Rahmat said graduates who possess AI skills can expect to see their career prospects become even more promising.
 “As the demand for AI continues to increase rapidly, so does the scope for job opportunities in this field,” she said.
 However, she advised students not to “become so obsessed” with AI that they indirectly ignore the importance of fields of science other than AI. 
 “Also, ensure that existing AI systems or applications are not misused by emphasising ethical awareness,” she said.Futureproof talents
 I initially didn’t know much about AI except that it was a new thing in IT. It was only after taking classes during my computer science degree programme that I realised how broad the field is and learnt about the many opportunities in AI. What I found attractive about AI is that it’s a new technology. So we are still learning through trial and error when we encounter problems. Even when you search for solutions online, sometimes there are no answers. It is stressful but at the same time, it is very interesting and fruitful when we are able to solve a problem. I still need to learn a lot more about the field because it is so vast. I am planning to pursue a master’s in AI when I am done with my degree. Only then will I join the corporate world. – Nur Sahira Sofea Azizan, 21AI is rapidly growing so I’m interested in how this latest technology can help solve real-world problems and ease the burdens of humanity. I have an interest in problem-solving and I think AI is the future. Nowadays, we use a lot of technology to help in our jobs. For example, in the medical field, there is medical imaging to help diagnosis. This is just one of the ways we can use AI to mimic human intelligence and to help society. I see myself going down this path. I want to use AI to contribute to the community too.– Shahrizal Ibrahim Jamaludin, 23I chose to study AI as it has become so important in our daily lives. AI technology is exploding with so many new things. Youths nowadays are already moving away from using search engines. Instead, many prefer keying prompts in generative AI tools like ChatGPT to search for something. I want to be a part of this growth. Maybe I will join a startup company after graduating to gain more skills and experience in this fast evolving field.– Muhammad Haikal Abdul Razak, 22Malaysia and AI> AI adoption is at an early to nascent stage at the national level with many companies already using AI to innovate their operations and business services.

651156,StarEdu,5,18/02/2024,"Zambry: Need for more AI, high-tech grads",,"Graduates in certain fields, especially artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programmes and the high-tech sector, need to be increased to meet industry and investor demands, says Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
 “There are certain areas that require more manpower due to the mismatch in skills driven by changes in the industry,” he said during a networking luncheon with the diplomatic missions in Malaysia on Feb 5.
 The gathering was to brief foreign diplomats from 72 missions about the future of the Malaysian higher education landscape as well as address issues and challenges faced by international students in completing their studies locally.
 During the event, Zambry shared that at a recent dialogue session with the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti), the Higher Education Ministry had recommended that foreign students be allowed to work in Malaysia post-graduation.
 “It serves our purpose in ensuring the physical and emotional welfare of our students who will go on to make great contributions in the workforce.
 “I have raised it during our dialogue and am pleased that Miti has taken it on for the good of everyone,” he said.
 On Feb 3, Investment, Trade And Industry Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the number of local graduates in the high-tech sector was insufficient to meet the demands of investors.
 Allowing foreign graduates from local higher education institutions (HEIs) to work temporarily in the country could address the need for more skilled workers, he said.
 Zambry said following the ministry’s discussion with Tengku Zafrul, efforts to meet industry demand for skilled graduates were underway, with the help of vice-chancellors of universities in the country to devise a solution to the constraints.
 Zambry said over the last three years, there have been a 6% average increase in the number of international students in Malaysia, with approximately 63,718 enrolled in private HEI’s.
 The ministry, he said, aimed to welcome students from all countries to study in Malaysia peacefully, and is looking at exploring better ways to assist foreign students in bringing their families along while pursuing postgraduate studies here.
 Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS) chief executive officer Novie Tajuddin said postgraduate students enrolled in public and private universities are eligible to apply for dependent passes on behalf of their families if they are citizens from the 17 Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries.
 Besides the visa processing issues, he said funding for postgraduate students who want to bring their parents along, has to be looked at.
 “We are assessing various possible methods to help them manage their family’s transition since our goal is to enhance Malaysia’s higher education presence on a global scale and reel in more foreign students to our shores,” he said.

649536,StarBiz,6,15/02/2024,Malaysia is seeking UAE’s expertise to boost cooperation in AI,,"DUBAI: Malaysian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Datuk Seri Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin has expressed the country’s interest in learning from the UAE’s advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
 The envoy said the potential to collaborate for mutual benefits could be further established and strengthened. 
 Ahmad Fadil was speaking to Bernama on the sidelines of the World Government Summitor WGS 2024 held here on Tuesday.
 Citing the global gathering’s theme “Shaping future governments” as a fantastic idea, Ahmad Fadil said: “In this context, I highly believe Malaysia will have the best opportunities to work with the UAE government as it is advanced in AI.”
 He also outlined Malaysia’s ambitions in renewable energy and data management and the potential for collaboration in both areas.
 “I believe the Malaysian government, through the renewable energy sector led by our Deputy Prime Minister who is also the Energy Transition and Public Utilities Minister, could further explore data centre and energy sector opportunities.
 “We have the expertise. It’s just that we need to tap into collaborations with leading entities in our country for mutual benefits in AI,” said Ahmad Fadil.
 In a move to bolster cooperation in renewable energy and AI, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and a delegation visited the Masdar City office and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence located within Masdar City last October.
 In January this year, the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) and the UAE’s Investment Ministry strengthened their commitment to advance investment cooperation in the digital infrastructure sector.
 Miti said both parties had signed a memorandum of understanding to mark a strategic partnership on the development of data centres in Malaysia with potential projects anticipated to achieve a total capacity of 500MW.

648478,StarBiz,5,12/02/2024,SoftBank sees new-found caution as secret weapon in AI arms race,,"FOR years, SoftBank Group splashed out billions on startups at near-peak valuations without batting an eye. 
 Now founder Masayoshi Son’s tech powerhouse is relying on a new weapon as it searches for the next big thing in AI: caution.
 The strategy marks a vast turnaround for a company that completely transformed the world of tech investing with its high-conviction bets on startups at an unheard of scale.
 It also highlights the lingering effect of SoftBank’s “defence mode”, a strategy it adopted after being hit by plummeting valuations in the aftermath of the pandemic, when higher interest rates eroded investor appetite for risk.
 “We’re being very prudent when we look at these opportunities out there,” Navneet Govil, the chief financial officer of Softbank’s investment arm, the Vision Fund, told Reuters in an interview last Thursday.
 “We’re financial investors not strategic investors.”
 The Vision Fund unit made just 29 new and follow-on investments in all of 2023 out of more than 300 companies it studied.
 The October-to-December quarter was the unit’s most miserly since 2017, with SoftBank saying the funds made US$100mil in new investments, a drop from the heady days of 2021, when they spent US$20.9bil in April to June alone.
 “It’s a good approach. Given the difficult period they went through, they’ve become very strict on choosing investees,” said Mitsunobu Tsuruo, an equity analyst at Citi who covers SoftBank.
 Last Thursday, SoftBank reported its first profit in five quarters, and a US$4bil investment gain at the Vision Fund business.
 Its war chest has ballooned to 4.4 trillion yen (US$29bil) in cash, cash equivalents and liquid bonds, it said.
 Even before the runaway success of chip design firm Arm, in which it owns around 90% and which listed in New York in September last year, SoftBank said it was exclusively focused on investing in artificial intelligence (AI).
 Arm’s share price surged more than 55% last Thursday, powered by forecasts of robust demand for its technology to design chips for AI features.
 SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto said Arm would soon be indispensable to AI and has previously called the chip designer “the core of the core” of SoftBank’s group of companies.
 Early innings
 Potential investments could be in AI hardware, infrastructure or applications, Govil said.
 “We’re still in the early innings of a fast-growing space. 
 “These disruptors can easily by disrupted by other disruptors.”
 Companies will need to meet strict criteria about their “transformative” quality and capacity for AI innovation, product market fit and scalability, unit economics, and track record of execution, Govil added.
 But when it comes to AI, SoftBank has a mixed track record.
 Although chief executive officer Son has touted the promise of AI as an investment opportunity for some years, the vast majority of the more than 400 companies currently in the portfolio have not seen their valuations rise despite the excitement surrounding AI and AI-related companies over the past year.
 “There aren’t many winners in the AI market,” said Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors.
 Valuations have shot up for companies seen as direct beneficiaries of a rise in AI-related applications, such as chip maker Nvidia. 
 That means there will be fewer, if any, companies that can meet SoftBank’s more stringent criteria.
 “Everyone’s on top of this. The ship has sailed,” Anvarzadeh said.
 While Son has made some bad bets on companies, such as now bankrupt office-sharing business WeWork, he’s also backed some big winners including AliBaba, Arm and mobile Internet technology, so it may yet be too early to rule him out of further AI gains.
 “There’s also a high chance that they’ll make an extremely large, controlling stake investment,” Citi’s Tsuruo said. 
 “They would need to make sure they have the dry powder for it.” — Reuters

648592,Main,15,12/02/2024,AI vs human creativity?,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence has had such as impact on the world that the acronym “AI” was named 2023’s Word of the Year by Collins Dictionary.
 While many wax lyrical over generative AI’s advances, the developments have also been greeted with cynicism, especially among those who champion human creativity. And while I am an advocate of using AI to enhance teaching and learning, a small part of me is indeed worried about the possible impact it could have on the originality and creativity of our younger generation – which is undoubtedly already using AI and will continue to do so for the rest of their lives.
 As a university lecturer, one of the tasks that falls under my purview is to assess student presentations. After almost 20 years in academia, from the time I was an undergraduate myself until today, I’ve probably attended hundreds of presentations. And though education is quite different now compared with 20 years ago, surprisingly, student presentations have remained largely unchanged. 
 Considering the range of modern presentation tools available today, one would expect presentations to be noticeably different from one another. Instead, I often see presentations that, at their core, are all the same, just with different graphical assets and colour schemes. They seem to lack originality. 
 There are tools that offer thousands of visual assets, themes, and designs to help you make any kind of presentation you want. On the surface, that  sounds amazing! But does simply choosing a template from a library help students develop original thinking? Is it creative expression or merely a choice made on a whim?
 Additionally, these presentation tools now also come with generative AI to help users write content. So not only would the design and visual aesthetic of presentations lack student originality, even the written content could be generated by AI as well. 
 Assessment of student work is one aspect of education that needs to be reimagined thanks to AI. But more importantly, the development of student originality, creativity, and critical thinking could also be impacted by the use of generative AI – and this, to my mind, is of far greater concern. If students graduate with an underdeveloped sense of originality and a poorer capacity for critical thinking, how would that affect their careers? And if our graduates struggle to think creatively, what does that mean for future innovation in Malaysia?
 In the video game Detroit: Become Human (developer Quantic Dream), human-like robots live side-by-side with humankind. At one point in the game, players learn that in this fictional world set in 2038, less than 5% of music is made by humans, with the androids making the rest. We are unlikely to reach this point in real life in our lifetime, but I do believe that the rampant proliferation of generative AI will eventually begin to diminish human creativity if we are not careful.
 Generative AI can be a wonderful learning tool, yet we must ensure it does not rob us of our opportunities to grow.

647798,StarBiz,12,09/02/2024,Arm forecast beats estimates as AI spurs  chip upgrades,,"SAN FRANCISCO: Arm Holdings surged more than 30% after the British tech company forecast fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations as customers aim to design new chips for artificial intelligence (AI) work, generating higher royalties.
 Arm’s forecast ranges for its fourth quarter had midpoints of US$875mil for sales and 30 US cents per share for adjusted earnings, above estimates of US$780.3mil and 21 US cents per share, according to LSEG data.
 Arm shares rose roughly 35% in after-hours trading after the forecast and results were released. The over 30% surge in Arm’s stock after its report late on Wednesday lifted its market capitalisation by about US$26bil.
 Now trading at US$102.11, Arm has doubled from the US$51 price set in its September initial public offering.
 Arm raised its guidance by roughly US$100mil because markets such as automotive and AI are going to be strong in the fiscal fourth quarter, finance chief Jason Child told Reuters.
 The company expects licensing revenue for chips that power AI in data centres, phones and PCs to be a significant factor.
 “The solid Arm earnings and, even more importantly, their robust forecasts are good signs for both the company and the tech industry overall,” said Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.
 Since 2016 Arm has significantly diversified its business. Smartphones now represent 35% of overall units shipped, versus in 2016 when the percentage was between 60% and 70%, Child told Reuters.
 The proliferation of Arm designs into other markets demonstrates its growing influence across tech businesses, TECHnalysis Research analysts said. Yet despite its diversification, Arm is still a relatively small player in AI.
 For the full fiscal year, Arm expects US$3.18bil in revenue and adjusted earnings of US$1.22 per share, both above analysts’ estimates of US$3.05bil and US$1.07 per share.
 “We’re seeing more interest in newer designs and newer technologies by customers” due to interest in AI, Child said. “It’s real. Folks are actually buying and licensing that technology.”
 A new version of Arm designs doubled the company’s royalty revenue, as the more advanced technology commands a higher rate.
 For the fiscal third quarter, Arm reported sales of US$824mil and adjusted earnings of 29 US cents per share, topping Wall Street estimates of US$761.6mil and 25 US cents per share.

647978,Main,17,09/02/2024,AI ‘represents’ South-East Asians,Biased GPT? Singapore builds model to lessen reliance on Western tech data,"Like millions worldwide, South-East Asians have been trying out large language models (LLM) such as Meta’s Llama 2 and Mistral AI – but in their native Bahasa Indonesia or Thai. The result has usually been gibberish in English.
 This leaves them at a disadvantage, tech experts warn, as gene­rative artificial intelligence transforms education, work and governance worldwide.
 A Singapore government-led initiative aims to correct the imbalance with a South-East Asian LLM, the first in a family of models named SEA-LION – South-East Asian Languages in One Network – trained in the region’s languages and cultural norms.
 Trained on data in 11 South-East Asian languages including Vietnamese, Thai and Bahasa Indonesia, the open-sourced model is a cheaper and more efficient option for the region’s businesses, governments and acade­mia, said Leslie Teo at AI Singa­pore.
 “Do we want to force every person in South-East Asia to adapt to the machine or do we want to make it more accessible so people in the region can make full use of the technology without having to be an English spea­ker?” he said.
 “We are not trying to compete with the big LLMs; we are trying to complement them so there can be better representation of us,” Teo, senior director for AI pro­ducts, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 There are over 7,000 languages spoken worldwide. Yet, LLMs including Open AI’s GPT-4 and Meta’s Llama 2 that are used to build AI systems such as chatbots and other tools, have largely been developed for and are trained on the English language.
 Governments and tech firms are trying to bridge this gap, with India creating datasets in local languages, an LLM in the United Arab Emirates powering generative AI tools in Arabic and AI models in China, Japan and Viet­nam in local languages.
 These models can help local populations participate more equitably in the global AI economy that is largely dominated by big tech firms, said Nuurrianti Jalli, an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University’s school of communications.
 “Regional LLMs are also needed because they support technology self-reliance,” she said. “Less reliance on Western LLMs could provide better privacy for local populations and also align better with national or regional interest.”
 Multilingual language models that are trained on text from seve­ral languages at once can infer semantic and grammatical connections between high-resource languages that have more data and low-resource languages, researchers say.
 These models can be used in a variety of applications from translation to customer-service chatbots and content moderation on social media platforms that have struggled to identify hate speech in low-resource languages such as Burmese or Amharic.
 About 13% of SEA-LION’s data is sourced from South-East Asian languages – more than any other major LLM, said Teo. More than 9% of its data is from Chinese text and about 63% is from English.
 Multilingual language models often train on translated text and other poor-quality data that may have errors, so AI Singapore is “careful” about the data used in training SEA-LION, Teo said in his office at the National University of Singapore.
 “The age of pristine data has passed – a lot of the stuff on the internet now is material that is generated by LLMs, so we need to verify and filter,” he said.
 “We cannot be perfect, but we also cannot take out everything we consider to be bad,” he added.
 More governments are contri­buting data and businesses are testing SEA-LION, which, due to its smaller size, can be deployed faster and is cheaper to fine-tune and adopt, Teo said.
 As more countries and regions build their own LLMs, digital and human rights experts fret that they will reproduce only the domi­nant views expressed online, which can be particularly problematic in nations with authoritarian governments or strict media censorship, or those lacking a strong civil society.
 “Training models on such data risks perpetuating biased, prejudiced, incomplete and even misleading narratives,” said Jalli.
 “The models may fail to surface important socio-political issues like human rights abuse, corruption or valid criticism of political powers,” she said.
 If a model is only trained on favourable articles about a government, then the model is “likely to adopt a worldview where the government is wholly positive and leaves behind dissenting viewpoints,” said Aliya Bhatia, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a US non-profit.
 “Regional LLMs may better reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances of local language spea­kers, but they may also have less information about the world in general,” she added.
 “There is a real risk of government-backed models instilling a revisionist view of history and undermining democratic values.”
 But the alternative – relying entirely on Western LLMs with “disproportionately large influences” from wealthy, liberal, western democracies – means per­­petuating different biases related to cultural values, political beliefs and social norms, accor-ding to AI Singapore.
 “These LLMs have a very particular West Coast American bias – they are very woke. They do not represent us,” said Teo.
 “We are not saying ours is the only perspective – we are just trying to rebalance it.” — Reuters",million south east asian language model meta llama mistral native bahasa indonesia thai result gibberish english leaf tech expert gene rative artificial intelligence transforms governance worldwide government initiative aim imbalance south east asian llm family model sea lion east asian language network trained region cultural norm data east asian language vietnamese thai bahasa indonesia model efficient option region business government mia leslie teo singa pore force person south east asia adapt machine accessible people region technology english spea ker compete complement representation teo senior director pro duct thomson reuters language worldwide llm gpt meta llama build system chatbots tool trained english language government tech firm gap india datasets local language united arab generative tool arabic model japan viet nam local language model local population global economy tech firm jalli assistant professor oklahoma university school communication regional llm support technology reliance reliance western llm privacy local population national regional multilingual language model text seve ral language semantic grammatical connection language data low resource researcher model variety application customer service chatbots content moderation social medium platform identify hate speech low resource burmese amharic sea lion data south east asian language major llm teo data chinese text english multilingual language model translated text poor quality data error careful data sea lion teo office national university age pristine data lot stuff internet material llm verify filter perfect bad government data business sea lion size cheaper fine tune adopt teo country region llm digital human right expert domi nant view online problematic nation authoritarian government strict medium censorship strong civil society training model risk prejudiced incomplete narrative jalli model surface socio political issue human right abuse corruption valid criticism political power favourable article government model worldview government positive leaf viewpoint aliya bhatia policy analyst center democracy technology profit regional llm linguistic cultural nuance local language spea kers real risk government model revisionist view history democratic value western llm wealthy liberal western democracy bias cultural value political belief social norm singapore llm west coast american bias represent teo perspective rebalance reuters,"[(2, 0.9021605), (3, 0.09542914)]",2
647574,Main,22,08/02/2024,Using AI in war on drugs,"US to hire 50 AI experts to crack down on fentanyl, child abuse","WASHINGTON: The US Depart-ment of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to hire 50 artificial intelligence experts this year to help it halt child abuse, counter fentanyl production and assess damage from natural disasters, as it seeks to increase use of the burgeoning technology.
 The agency, tasked with securing US borders, announced the hiring effort at an event in Mountain View, California, headlined by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen.
 “Government needs the support and expertise of our country’s foremost AI experts to help ensure our continued ability to harness this technology responsibly, safeguard against its malicious use, and advance our critical homeland security mission,” Mayorkas said in a statement.
 The agency did not provide specifics on what the experts will do, but noted that they would provide expertise in cybersecurity, data science and software engineering.
 The plan is part of the Biden administration’s nascent efforts to harness the potential benefits of AI while reining in the biggest threats it poses, where Europe has made much more significant progress.
 Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts, in recent months has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete and upend elections by making it difficult to distinguish between fact and false information.
 Officials on Tuesday highlighted ways that AI is already helping the DHS crack down on illegal drug imports by using a machine learning model to identify suspicious patterns in vehicles crossing the border, which has led to 240 drug seizures.
 The agency is also already using a machine learning model to enhance older images, allowing it to identify 300 previously unknown victims of sexual exploitation as well as some perpetrators. And AI is helping the department’s Federal Emergency Management Agency more efficiently assess damage to homes and buildings after a natural disaster.

 The presentation includes a slide showcasing the “key attributes that drove OpenAI’s success”, such as strategic partnerships and access to capital, and a side-by-side comparison showing xAI’s similarities.
 Another slide features graphs depicting OpenAI’s rapid user growth and projected revenue increases, and includes the line “OpenAI provides line of sight to xAI’s potential trajectory”. 
 Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.
 The deck also highlights Musk, the world’s richest person, and his history as an entrepreneur, with many of his other companies touted throughout the presentation.

644448,Main,16,01/02/2024,AI in whistleblowing practices,,"WHILE whistleblowing has emerged as a linchpin for maintaining organisational integrity in Malaysian corporate governance, it still has to navigate a terrain fraught with cultural and legal complexities. 
 The Malaysian corporate ethos, traditionally respectful of hierarchy, often clashes with open criticism, which is essential for effective reporting of improper, illegal or immoral activity within organisations. 
 The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) 2010 facilitates disclosure of improper conduct in the public and private sector, protects persons making those disclosures from detrimental action, and provides for the matters disclosed to be investigated and dealt with. 
 Nevertheless, there is a cultural reluctance to embrace whistleblowing, which is often viewed as a risky pursuit.
 Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is now redefining the whistleblowing process. Its ability to dissect large datasets and identify unethical patterns brings an unprecedented level of objectivity and efficiency to whistleblowing. 
 AI becomes particularly crucial in a culture where direct criticism is often circumvented.
 Increasing awareness of the importance of whistleblowing within Malaysian organisations, as highlighted by the Deloitte 2023 Asia Pacific Conduct Watch Survey Report, underscores the need for stronger policy implementation and a cultural shift. 
 AI-driven platforms align well with the protective measures outlined in the WPA as they provide anonymity and confidential reporting channels. 
 However, the integration of AI into whistleblowing systems must be navigated carefully, considering Malaysia’s unique cultural and legal context.
 1. Begin by evaluating the existing whistleblowing infrastructure, understanding cultural nuances, legal frameworks, and identifying areas where AI can add value.
 2. Tailor the choice of AI tools to the organisation’s specific needs, focusing on data analysis for pattern recognition, secure communication channels, and automated report management systems. 
 3. Align the AI system with legal and ethical standards. Compliance with Malaysian laws, especially the Whistleblower Protection Act 2010 and ISO 37002 guidelines, is critical. 
 4. Update the organisation’s whistleblowing policies to incorporate AI use. Training sessions for employees should emphasise the importance of whistleblowing, the functionality of the AI-enhanced system, and assurances regarding protection and confidentiality.
 5. Deploy AI tools within the existing infrastructure, ensuring technical integration and seamless operation. Continuous monitoring of the system’s effectiveness and ethical operation is essential. 
 6. Establish a feedback loop from users of the whistleblowing system, using this input for ongoing improvement to ensure the system’s effectiveness and that it aligns with organisational values and legal requirements.
 7. Cultivate and nurture a culture that values transparency, ethical behaviour, and open communication.  
 The integration of AI into whistleblowing practices is a crucial step towards advancing a more ethical and transparent corporate environment in Malaysia. 
 It would bridge the gap between traditional corporate culture and modern ethical standards, thus offering a safer, more secure environment for whistleblowers.

These scenarios present a strategic opportunity for the group as an increasing number of existing and prospective customers are exploring expansion of their operations in Malaysia,” he told the media after the company’s listing ceremony yesterday.
 While the group has plans to address the expansion of data centres in Johor, Haw said the company is also looking to benefit from the recently announced Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone.
 “We plan to set up data centres there, so we can get a piece of the cake from that market,” he said.
 He added that, as part of its post-listing expansion plans, HE Group will open new offices in Kedah in addition to Johor, with plans to start operations by 2025.
 “There are a lot of investments in Kedah, especially in Kulim and all the semiconductor giants are there,” he added.
 Haw further stated that synergies between the group’s expansion plans, the government’s policies and its status as a listed company will further fuel its growth initiatives while capitalising on market opportunities.
 “Looking ahead, the opportunities presented by the government policies inject a refreshing sense of optimism, creating a favourable business environment for the group,” he said.
 HE Group debuted on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia at 43 sen a share, representing a 15 sen or 53.57% premium to its initial public offering (IPO) price of 28 sen a share. The stock closed at 32 sen yesterday.
 HE Group’s IPO saw an oversubscription of 63.35 times prior to its debut on the Ace Market.
 Meanwhile, in a filing with Bursa Malaysia, HE Group said its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hexatech Engineering Sdn Bhd, had accepted a new work order from a manufacturer of semiconductor components in relation to a design, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of low voltage power distribution system for RM34.79mil.",jaya electrical engineering service provider bhd upbeat semiconductor industry artificial intelligence electric vehicle director amos haw chee seng ev chip potential boom industry geopolitical tension united china malaysia benefit malaysia stable ecosystem lot data centre chipmakers business operation scenario strategic opportunity prospective customer expansion operation medium company listing ceremony yesterday address expansion data centre haw company benefit johor singapore special economic zone plan data centre market post expansion plan office addition johor plan operation lot investment kulim semiconductor giant synergy expansion plan government policy status company fuel growth market opportunity opportunity government policy sense optimism favourable business environment ace market bursa malaysia sen share sen premium initial public offering ipo price sen share stock sen yesterday oversubscription time debut ace market bursa malaysia subsidiary hexatech engineering sdn bhd manufacturer semiconductor component design supply installation low voltage power distribution system mil,"[(0, 0.05183793), (4, 0.9423761)]",4
643534,Main,16,29/01/2024,AI’s nefarious potential,,"WHEN the parole board in the US state of Louisiana met in October to discuss the potential release of a convicted murderer, it called on a doctor with years of experience in mental health to talk about the inmate.
 The board was not the only group paying attention.
 A collection of online trolls took screenshots of the doctor from an online feed of her testimony and edited the images with artificial intelligence tools to make her appear naked. They then shared the manipulated files on 4chan, an anonymous message board known for fostering harassment and spreading hateful content and conspiracy theories.
 It was one of numerous times that people on 4chan had used new AI-powered tools such as audio editors and image generators to spread racist and offensive content about people who had appeared before the parole board, according to Daniel Siegel, a graduate student at Columbia University who researches how AI is being exploited for malicious purposes. Siegel chronicled the activity on the site for several months.
 The manipulated images and audio have not spread far beyond the confines of 4chan, Siegel said. But experts who monitor fringe message boards said the efforts offered a glimpse at how nefarious internet users could employ sophisticated AI tools to supercharge online harassment and hate campaigns in the months and years ahead.
 Callum Hood, head of research at the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, said fringe sites such as 4chan – perhaps the most notorious of them all – often gave early warning signs for how new technology would be used to project extreme ideas.
 Those platforms, he said, are filled with young people who are “very quick to adopt new technologies” such as AI to “project their ideology back into mainstream spaces”.
 Those tactics, he said, are often adopted by some users on more popular online platforms.
 Here are several problems resulting from AI tools that experts discovered on 4chan – and what regulators and technology companies are doing about them.
 AI tools such as Dall-E and Midjourney generate novel images from simple text descriptions. But a new wave of AI image generators are made for the purpose of creating fake pornography, including removing clothes from existing images.
 “They can use AI to just create an image of exactly what they want,” Hood said of online hate and misinformation campaigns.
 There is no law in the United States banning the creation of fake images of people, leaving groups such as the Louisiana parole board scrambling to determine what can be done. The board opened an investigation in response to Siegel’s findings on 4chan.
 “Any images that are produced portraying our board members or any participants in our hearings in a negative manner, we would definitely take issue with,” said Francis Abbott, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole.
 “But we do have to operate within the law, and whether it’s against the law or not – that has to be determined by somebody else.”
 Illinois expanded its law governing revenge pornography to allow targets of non-consensual pornography made by AI systems to sue creators or distributors. California, Virginia and New York have also passed laws banning the distribution or creation of AI-generated pornography without consent.
 Late last year, AI company ElevenLabs released a tool that could create a convincing digital replica of someone’s voice saying anything typed into the program.
 Almost as soon as the tool went live, users on 4chan circulated clips of a fake Emma Watson, a British actor, reading Adolf Hitler’s manifesto, Mein Kampf.
 Using content from the Louisiana parole board hearings, 4chan users have since shared fake clips of judges uttering offensive and racist comments about defendants.
 Many of the clips were generated by ElevenLabs’ tool, according to Siegel, who used an AI voice identifier developed by ElevenLabs to investigate their origins.
 ElevenLabs rushed to impose limits, including requiring users to pay before they could gain access to voice-cloning tools. But the changes did not seem to slow the spread of AI-created voices, experts said.
 Scores of videos using fake celebrity voices have circulated on TikTok and YouTube – many of them sharing political disinformation.
 Some major social media companies, including TikTok and YouTube, have since required labels on some AI content.
 US President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October asking that all companies label such content and directed the Commerce Department to develop standards for watermarking and authenticating AI content.
 As Meta moved to gain a foothold in the AI race, the company embraced a strategy to release its software code to researchers. The approach, broadly called “open source,” can speed development by giving academics and technologists access to more raw material to find improvements and develop their own tools.
 When the company released Llama, its large language model, to select researchers last February, the code quickly leaked onto 4chan. People there used it for different ends: they tweaked the code to lower or eliminate guardrails, creating new chatbots capable of producing antisemitic ideas.
 The effort previewed how free-to-use and open-source AI tools can be tweaked by technologically savvy users.
 “While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness,” a spokesman for Meta said in an email.
 In the months since, language models have been developed to echo far-right talking points or to create more sexually explicit content. Image generators have been tweaked by 4chan users to produce nude images or provide racist memes, bypassing the controls imposed by larger technology companies. — ©2024 The New York Times Company",parole board potential release murderer doctor experience mental health talk board attention collection online troll doctor online feed testimony image artificial intelligence tool manipulated file anonymous message board harassment hateful content conspiracy theory numerous time people powered tool audio editor image generator racist offensive content people parole board daniel graduate student columbia university malicious purpose activity site month image audio spread confines siegel expert fringe message board effort nefarious internet user sophisticated tool online harassment hate campaign month hood head centre digital hate fringe site notorious warning sign technology project extreme idea platform people quick adopt technology project ideology mainstream space tactic user popular online platform tool expert chan regulator technology company tool dall midjourney generate image text description image generator fake pornography clothes image create image hood online hate misinformation campaign law creation fake image people louisiana parole board board investigation response siegel finding chan image board participant hearing negative manner issue abbott executive director louisiana board pardon committee operate law law law revenge pornography target consensual pornography system sue creator distributor virginia york law distribution creation pornography consent late company elevenlabs tool create convincing digital replica voice program tool user clip emma watson british actor adolf hitler manifesto mein content louisiana board hearing user fake clip judge offensive racist comment defendant clip elevenlabs tool siegel voice identifier elevenlabs investigate origin impose limit user access voice tool slow spread voice expert score fake celebrity voice tiktok youtube political disinformation major social medium company tiktok youtube label content president joe biden executive october company content commerce department develop standard content meta gain foothold race company strategy release software code researcher source speed development academic technologist access raw material improvement tool company llama language model select researcher february code chan people code eliminate guardrail chatbots capable antisemitic idea effort free source tool savvy user accessible circumvent approval process current release strategy balance responsibility spokesman meta email month language model create explicit content image generator chan user nude image racist meme control larger technology company time company,"[(2, 0.99737495)]",2
643668,Lifestyle,3,29/01/2024,Humans beat AI in affordability,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) can’t replace the majority of jobs right now in cost-effective ways, the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found in a study that sought to address fears about AI replacing humans in a swath of industries.
 In one of the first in-depth probes of the viability of AI displacing labour, researchers modelled the cost-attractiveness of automating various tasks in the United States, concentrating on jobs where computer vision was employed – for instance, teachers and property appraisers.
 They found only 23% of workers, measured in terms of dollar wages, could be effectively supplanted. In other cases, because AI-assisted visual recognition is expensive to install and operate, humans did the job more economically.
 The adoption of AI across industries accelerated last year after OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative tools showed the technology’s potential. Tech firms from Microsoft and Alphabet in the US to Baidu and Alibaba Group in China rolled out new AI services and ramped up development plans – at a pace that some industry leaders cautioned was recklessly fast. Fears about AI’s impact on jobs have long been a central concern.
 “‘Machines will steal our jobs’ is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models”, the researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page paper titled Beyond AI Exposure.
 “We find that only 23% of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI  computer vision would be cost- effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.”
 Computer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to derive meaningful information from digital images and other visual inputs, with its most ubiquitous applications showing up in object detection systems for autonomous driving or in helping categorise photos on smartphones.
 The cost-benefit ratio of computer vision is most favourable in segments like retail, transportation and warehousing, all areas where Walmart and Amazon are prominent. It’s also feasible in the health-care context, according ot MIT’s paper.
 A more aggressive AI rollout, especially via AI-as-a-service subscription offerings, could scale up other uses and make them more viable, the authors said.
 The study was funded by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and used online surveys to collect data on about 1,000 visually-assisted tasks across 800 occupations.
 Only 3% of such tasks can be automated cost-effectively today, but that could rise to 40% by 2030 if data costs fall and accuracy improves, the researchers said.
 The sophistication of ChatGPT and rivals like Google’s Bard has rekindled concern about AI plundering jobs, as the new chatbots show proficiency in tasks previously only humans were capable of performing.
 The International Monetary Fund said that almost 40% of jobs globally would be impacted and that policymakers would need to carefully balance AI’s potential with the negative fallout.
 At the World Economic Forum in Davos recently, many discussions focused on AI displacing the workforce. The co-founder of Inflection AI and Google’s DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, said that AI systems are “fundamentally labour-replacing tools”.
 One case study in the paper looked at a hypothetical bakery. Bakers visually inspect ingredients for quality control on a daily basis, but that comprises only 6% of their duties, the researchers said.
 The saving in time and wages from implementing cameras and an AI system is still far from the cost of such a technological upgrade, they concluded.
 “Our study examines the usage of computer vision across the economy, examining its applicability to each occupation across nearly every industry and sector,” said Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.“We show that there will be more automation in retail and healthcare and less in areas like construction, mining or real estate,” he said via email. – Bloomberg",artificial intelligence majority job effective massachusetts technology mit study address fear human swath industry probe viability labour researcher cost attractiveness task united job computer vision instance teacher property appraiser worker term dollar wage visual recognition expensive install operate human job adoption industry openai chatgpt generative tool technology potential tech firm baidu alibaba china service development plan pace industry leader fast fear impact job central concern machine steal job sentiment time rapid technological change anxiety creation language model researcher computer science artificial intelligence laboratory paper exposure worker compensation computer vision cost effective firm upfront cost system computer vision field enables machine derive meaningful digital image visual input ubiquitous application detection system autonomous categorise photo cost benefit ratio computer vision favourable segment retail transportation walmart amazon prominent feasible health care context mit paper aggressive rollout service subscription offering scale viable author funded mit ibm watson lab online survey data task occupation task cost data cost accuracy researcher sophistication chatgpt rival concern job chatbots proficiency task human capable international monetary fund job policymakers potential negative fallout economic forum davos discussion workforce founder inflection google deepmind mustafa suleyman system tool paper hypothetical bakery baker inspect ingredient quality daily basis duty researcher time wage camera system cost technological upgrade study examines computer vision economy applicability occupation industry sector neil thompson director futuretech project mit computer science artificial intelligence lab automation retail healthcare construction mining real estate email bloomberg,"[(2, 0.17459625), (5, 0.8221389)]",5

 PROS: Boasts an amazing array of AI features; bright display that looks great outdoors; excellent cameras for all occasions; powerful processor tweaked for the Galaxy device;  feature-packed; extended software support.
 CONS: Some AI features require refining; pricey.WITH the world in the grips of generative artificial intelligence, it’s no surprise that the top Android smartphone maker has chosen to enhance its flagship devices with cutting-edge AI technology.
 Dubbed Galaxy AI, it breathes new life into its smartphones, offering features you probably never thought possible at your fingertips.
 To begin, let’s look at something as straightforward as generative wallpapers that let you create your own personalised backdrops.
 For example, you could ask the AI to create a wallpaper featuring robots or hot air balloons in a jungle using the avant-garde style. While the options are limited – I’ve encountered no more than three – you get out-of-this-world images that you can call your own.
 Taking it a step up, manipulating images becomes a breeze with AI, allowing you to effortlessly eliminate, move or resize objects by just pressing on them, which will make the AI outline the object. This tool is handy for those times when an unexpected photobomber spoils what would have been the perfect shot.However, the results are not always picture perfect – if the AI lacks sufficient information to fill the void left by the removed person or object, it’s essentially an educated guess at best.
 Moving on, if you have dreamt of directing like John Woo, try tapping and holding down any section of a video clip to create a slow-mo effect.
 The AI achieves the effect through interpolation, inserting extra frames to decelerate the video.
 It’s fun, it’s easy and it’s quick, but it can get glitchy, as not all segments may transition seamlessly, but, hey, it might work great for social media.
 Then there is Circle to Search with Google, which lets you identify items, be they on a photo, video or basically anything on the screen.
 All it takes is pressing down on the home button, which will appear as a line at the bottom if you are using swipe gestures for the navigation bar, and circling the object to initiate a Google image search on it.The feature is intended for you to help discover more about what you are looking at. I have been experimenting with plant images, as I wish I had better knowledge of the local flora, and it seems to work quite well.
 Transcribe and translate
 Galaxy AI’s powers extend beyond photos and videos, amplifying any feature that involves text and voice as well.
 The Voice Recorder app, for instance, is now able to transcribe audio clips while being able to recognise multiple different people.
 Though it could successfully distinguish between the people in the recording, the translation wasn’t always accurate. 
 The feature works better when there is just one person talking very clearly to the microphone, making it better for taking personal notes.
 Once transcribed, or with any text, the AI can not only summarise the note but also format it into headlines and bullets, and it performs this task amazingly well.
 On top of that, the AI can translate any text (and voice), currently supporting 13 languages, including English, Mandarin, and Spanish. For some languages, it includes multiple locales – United States and the United Kingdom for English, for example. As of now, it doesn’t support Bahasa Malaysia.
 And it gets even more advanced with the Live Translate feature that works in real-time for calls. This feature, available in the native Phone app, is claimed to be able to translate calls into any of the 13 languages, which sounds especially useful when overseas.
 And it does this fairly fast and seamlessly – as you talk, it translates the other person’s voice and vice versa. It also displays the translated text and works with any phone, not just the S24 Ultra.However, while it performed acceptably in certain parts of the conversation, it wasn’t consistent throughout when translating from Mandarin to English, making it a feature that holds the potential to be a game changer in the future.
 Conversely, the real-time text translation was seamless, enabling me to chat effortlessly with a person who messaged me in Chinese on WhatsApp.
 You can also tailor the tone of your messages using Chat Assist, which provides choices like professional, casual, and even social media styles, complete with emojis and hashtags.
 Beautiful, bold and bright
 After umpteen years, Samsung has moved from a curved screen – something that it pioneered and popularised – back to a flat display for the S24 Ultra.
 Some may not find it sexy, but the change is subtle and is a nicer canvas for the S Pen stylus.
 The display is now exceptionally bright, boasting a peak brightness of 2,600 nits, a significant increase from its predecessor’s already bright 1,750 nits.
 The bump in brightness makes it one of the most legible phones when outdoors, making competitors pale in comparison.Additionally, there has been a 75% reduction in glare, which is a very noticeable change that greatly improves the viewability of the display due to reduced reflections.As with every new model, the screen has received another upgrade in toughness, this time from Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to Armor. Combined with the titanium frame – a first for the Galaxy range – it’s claimed to be Samsung’s most durable smartphone yet.
 The cameras, which largely remain the same from the last version, also get a boost from AI.
 Compared to the S23 Ultra, which was already excellent, the photos were more detailed in some areas.
 Advancing generative AI
 What better way to dive into the world of AI than with a smartphone, which you always have by your side?
 Though the AI features require refining, they are only likely to improve through software updates, and I, for one, can’t wait to see what’s next.
 It’s also commendable that Samsung has adopted a responsible approach, primarily in two ways.
 Firstly, for AI functions executed on-device, nothing ever leaves your smartphone, ensuring that your data stays private.
 Secondly, every image – even wallpapers – that is altered will bear a watermark, letting others know that they have been manipulated using AI.
 The S24 Ultra is available in seven colours, with three options exclusive to Samsung.com. My personal favourite is the Sandstorm Orange, which is also a timely choice as Pantone has declared Peachy Fuzz the colour of the year.However, the smartphone doesn’t come cheap – it starts at RM6,299 for the 256GB model – but this is a device that could last years.
 Samsung, for example, has promised seven generations of Android OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.
 And it even comes with WiFi 7 at a time when there are hardly any consumer devices with this next-generation wireless tech. In fact, you’ll even find it hard (and expensive) to get your hands on a WiFi 7 router.

643394,Lifestyle,20,28/01/2024,The AI onslaught,,"THE rapid development of novel artificial intelligence (AI) tools will lead to an increase in cyberattacks and lower the barrier of entry for less sophisticated hackers to do digital harm, Britain’s GCHQ spy agency warned.
 That lower entry barrier will also likely contribute to the global rise in ransomware attacks, whereby criminals encrypt computer systems for a digital ransom, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ, said in a report.“AI will almost certainly increase the volume and heighten the impact of cyberattacks over the next two years. 
 However, the impact on the cyberthreat will be uneven,” the report said.
 It suggested the biggest increase in capability for malicious actors in cyberspace would go to opportunistic hackers who do not necessarily possess the skills needed to carry out higher-level attacks.
 At the very least, the report said, the use of generative AI tools like chatbots can help create more convincing emails or documents used in online phishing campaigns.
 On an advanced level, more capable state-backed hackers were “best placed to harness AI’s potential in advanced cyber operations against networks, for example, in advanced malware generation”, said the report, referring to malicious software and computer viruses.
 Intelligence agencies across the world are grappling with the rise of potential security problems tied to algorithms that can generate human-sounding interactions, dubbed large language models, or LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which businesses are incorporating into a wide range of services, including sales and customer care.

 He was speaking at the second session of the 16th Beijing Municipal People’s Congress on Sunday.
 In recent years, the city has pioneered in key technology, infrastructure and application related to the digital sector. 
 “For example, Beijing built 30,000 5G bases last year. It has about half of the country’s generative artificial intelligence (AI) large model products available for the public. 
 “It has a 160 sq km high-level demonstration zone for automatic driving,” Yin said while delivering a government work report during the opening ceremony of the session.
 In 2023, the city’s gross domestic product (GDP) reached 4.4 trillion yuan (US$61.16bil), up 5.2% year-on-year, while the digital economy contributed 42.9% to its GDP, compared with 41.6% in 2022. 
 Beijing has set a GDP growth target of 5% for this year, according to the government work report.
 In 2024, the city will further improve underlying technology of AI and make its AI models as advanced as international ones, promoting its application in government administration, the medical field, industries and life services, according to the work report.
 Automatic driving will be applied in more scenarios such as airports, railway stations and urban road cleaning. 
 The city is developing more emerging digital infrastructure such as 10 gigawatt optical network and Internet of Vehicles to serve the construction of a smart city, the report added.
 Luo Aiwu, director of Beijing Building Construction Research Institute Co’s scientific research and quality management department, said at a news conference on Sunday that construction of a smart city aims to bring better living experiences for residents and improve their sense of happiness.
 “We can foresee a broader coverage of digital devices,” said Luo, who is also a member of the 14th Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People’s        Political Consultative Conference.
 “Intelligent transport will ease traffic jams. The Internet of Things can monitor pollution. 
 “We can also explore more possibilities such as showing the location of barrier free facilities as well as number of tourists at an attraction, on portable devices to improve tourism experience.”

641158,Main,14,23/01/2024,Be wary of AI’s cold logic,,"HAVE you heard about the British Post Office scandal? It is not a scam. And there are many lessons we can learn from it, I believe.
 It unfolded between 1999 and 2015 but is in the news again this month after a four-part ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office: The Real Story, aired in the United Kingdom.
 An appalling systemic miscarriage of justice began when a newly developed computer accounting software introduced by the British Post made it look like money was missing from post office branches across Britain. Consequently, 230 post office workers were imprisoned on false charges of theft and fraud, and thousands of others were accused of similar misdeeds, according to BBC.com.
 Innocent lives were ruined. People lost their jobs, homes and dignity. Some went bankrupt. Some died waiting for justice; a few committed suicide. And it was all due to a faulty IT system.
 To me, what is especially tragic is that when they had to judge between the trustworthiness of the many individuals involved and a computer system, top management chose to believe the latter, as if technology could do no wrong. 
 A court finally ruled in 2019 that it was the computer software that was to blame and some people have had their convictions quashed. But most are still awaiting justice. Even if everyone is cleared, it’s too late, the damage has been done already.
 So here we are in Malaysia, at the crossroads of a new technological onslaught – what some say is the pinnacle of human achievement – artificial intelligence (AI). 
 Embrace it or be left out of life is the prevailing attitude.
 But be careful what you embrace. (No, I’m not talking about an AI Armageddon posing an existential risk to us.) As the saga above shows, mistakes can occur in technology, and the effects can be far-reaching indeed.There is no perfect system in the world. What we hail as “intelligence” is a misnomer as AI inherently contains biases and is not neutral – AI is developed by humans and learns from the human experience, after all. 
 I’ve heard AI-assisted programmes can even “hallucinate” and generate false information.
 AI employs cold logic and may create a convincing illusion of superiority and being all-knowing but it cannot make human judgements. It has no humility; it is an empty soul that we humans must not fall into.

640692,StarBiz,10,22/01/2024,Altman seeks to raise billions for AI chip venture,,"SAN FRANCISCO: OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman (pix), who has been working to raise billions of dollars from global investors for a chip venture, aims to use the funds to set up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors, according to several people with knowledge of the plans.
 Altman has had conversations with several large potential investors in the hopes of raising the vast sums needed for chip fabrication plants, or fabs, as they’re known colloquially, said the people, who requested anonymity because the conversations are private. 
 Firms that have held discussions with Altman include Abu Dhabi-based G42, people told Bloomberg last month, and SoftBank Group Corp, some of the people said. 
 The project would involve working with top chip manufacturers, and the network of fabs would be global in scope, some of the people said.
 While efforts to raise funds for a chip venture were earlier reported by Bloomberg, the scope of the project and the focus on manufacturing wasn’t previously known. 
 The talks are still early and a full list of involved partners and funders hasn’t been established, the people said. 
 Altman’s fundraising push reflects his concern that as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more pervasive, there won’t be enough chips for widespread deployment, some of the people said. 
 Some current forecasts for production of AI-related chips fall short of projected demand.
 Building and maintaining fabs that manufacture semiconductors is far more expensive than the approach favoured by many of OpenAI’s AI industry peers. 
 Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Microsoft Corp  – OpenAI’s largest investor – typically focus on designing their own custom silicon and then farm out manufacturing to outside companies. 
 Constructing a single state-of-the-art fabrication plant can require tens of billions of dollars, and creating a network of such facilities would take years. 
 The talks with G42 alone had focused on raising US$8bil to US$10bil, people told Bloomberg previously, although the current status of the discussions are unclear. 
 Altman believes the industry needs to act now to ensure there’s sufficient supply near the end of the decade, according to people familiar with his thinking. 
 Since OpenAI released ChatGPT more than a year ago, interest in AI applications has skyrocketed among companies and consumers. 
 That in turn has spurred massive demand for the computing power and processors needed to build and run those AI programmes. 
 Altman has said repeatedly that there already aren’t enough chips for his company’s needs.
 Intel Corp, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co lead the chip fabrication market and are potential partners for OpenAI.
 Altman had been hard at work on the chips project until he was temporarily ousted as OpenAI CEO in November. Upon his return, he rekindled the efforts. 
 Altman has also sounded out Microsoft on the plan, and the software giant is interested, according to two people. 
 OpenAI, G42, Intel, Microsoft, SoftBank and TSMC declined to comment. Samsung officials weren’t immediately available to comment.
 G42, which focuses on AI, has been the subject of calls this month by a key US lawmaker for greater scrutiny and trade restrictions. 
 House China Select Committee chairman Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin, raised concerns about G42’s relationships with blacklisted Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co and Beijing Genomics Institute, as well as risks to research at US universities.
 Gallagher urged Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo to consider sanctions on G42 and 13 of its subsidiaries and affiliates. — Bloomberg",san francisco penai chief executive officer altman pix raise billion dollar global investor chip venture fund network factory manufacture semiconductor people plan altman conversation potential investor vast sum chip fabrication plant people anonymity conversation private firm discussion altman dhabi people bloomberg month corp people top chip manufacturer network fabs global scope people effort fund chip venture bloomberg scope project focus talk involved partner funders people altman push concern artificial intelligence pervasive chip widespread deployment people current forecast production chip demand fabs manufacture semiconductor approach openai industry peer google microsoft corp largest investor custom silicon farm manufacturing company single art fabrication plant require ten billion dollar network facility talk bil bil people bloomberg current status discussion altman industry sufficient supply decade people familiar openai chatgpt application company consumer massive demand power processor programme chip company intel corp taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsmc samsung electronics chip fabrication market potential partner altman hard chip openai ceo november return effort microsoft plan software giant people intel microsoft softbank tsmc comment samsung official focus subject call month key lawmaker scrutiny trade restriction house china committee chairman gallagher republican wisconsin concern relationship chinese company huawei technology genomics institute risk university commerce secretary gina raimondo sanction subsidiary affiliate,"[(0, 0.9954913)]",0
640892,Lifestyle,5,22/01/2024,Augmented with AI,Samsung’s Galaxy S24 flagship series is supercharged with artificial intelligence.,"ELECTRONICS giant Samsung has incorporated generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its highly anticipated new flagship series, the Galaxy S24.
 Showcasing a sleek premium design, the S24 series introduces three models: the S24 Ultra with a 6.8in display, the S24+ with a 6.7in screen, and the base model S24 featuring a 6.2in display – all equipped with the company’s innovative Galaxy AI.
 TM Roth, Samsung Electronics president and head of its Mobile eXperience Business, says that the newly launched devices tap into the company’s history of innovation to transform how users interact with their devices.
 “Galaxy AI is built on our innovation heritage and deep understanding of how people use their phones. We’re excited to see how our users around the world empower their everyday lives with Galaxy AI to open up new possibilities,” he says.
 The integration of AI yields interesting features, including live translation for calls, allowing users to engage in phone conversations while the AI generates audio translations and transcripts.
 Audio and text translations will appear in real-time as you speak, the company said, claiming that “calling someone who speaks another language (is) about as simple as turning on closed captions when you stream a show”.
 As it’s on-device, Samsung assures that a user’s private conversations never leave the phone.
 The Galaxy S24 also includes Chat Assist within the Samsung Keyboard, which translates text and offers suggestions for tone adjustments and grammar corrections when messaging. This feature can be used in popular apps like WhatsApp and Instagram.
 Galaxy AI’s capabilities also extend to productivity enhancement by assisting users in generating transcripts, meeting minutes, and summaries directly from the notes provided.
 On top of that, it can generate translations for text documents and webpages.
 At launch, 13 language packs will be available for download, including English, Mandarin, Korean and Japanese.
 The S24 will also see the debut of the ‘Circle to Search’ gesture, which allows users to circle an item displayed on screen to trigger a search for information on Google.
 The company is touting it as a “world’s first” and this feature is designed to function not only on images or photos but also on snippets from videos across various social media platforms.
 When it comes to images, users can use AI for photo enhancement and editing. For example, they can highlight and tap on a specific element to have Galaxy AI remove it and fill the gap with an appropriate background.
 The S24 Ultra model is equipped with four rear cameras: a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 200-megapixel wide camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera.
 Under the hood is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Mobile Platform for Galaxy, a chip optimised for Samsung’s smartphones.
 Both the S24+ and S24, which run on an in-house Exynos 2400 chip, have a triple rear camera setup: a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 50-megapixel wide camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera.
 All three models feature a 12-megapixel selfie camera.
 The phones boast a Dynamic Amoled 2X display, offering an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, and the company is also promising its “brightest display ever” with a 2,600nits peak brightness.
 In terms of battery size, the S24 Ultra has a 5,000mAh battery, the same as last year, while the S24+ got a 200mAh bump to 4,900mAh and the S24 got a 100mAh increase to 4,000mAh.
 The S24 Ultra and S24+ are equipped with 12GB RAM, whereas the S24 features 8GB RAM. And the flagship devices now come with seven generations of OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.
 Both the S24+ and S24 will come in seven colour options: Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet and Amber Yellow, with three online exclusives (Sandstone Orange, Sapphire Blue and Jade Green).
 The S24 Ultra, the first-ever Galaxy phone to feature a titanium frame, offers seven options: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Violet and Titanium Yellow, with three online exclusives (Titanium Blue, Titanium Orange, and Titanium Green).
 The S24 Ultra comes with a price tag of RM6,299 for the 256GB model, RM6,799 for the 512GB version, and RM7,799 for the online exclusive 1TB variant.
 The S24+ will be available at RM4,899 for the 256GB model and RM5,399 for the 512GB variant, while the S24 is priced at RM4,099 for the 256GB model and RM4,599 for the 512GB version.
 Pre-orders for the devices are available until Feb 6. During the pre-order period, customers can enjoy a “double storage upgrade” valued at RM500, allowing them, for example, to buy a 512GB model at the price of a 256GB version.
 For pre-orders, the S24 Ultra 512GB is priced at RM6,299, the S24 Ultra 1TB at RM7,299, the S24+ 512GB at RM4,899, and the S24 512GB at RM4,099.

640140,Lifestyle,4,21/01/2024,AI and the     future of food,"The columnist looks at the pros and cons of using AI in food production, farming, livestock management and even home cooking.","I RECENTLY came across the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks report, which summarises the main expected risks for our planet in 2024 as assessed by around 1,500 national leaders. Top of the list is ‘Extreme Weather’, which is the top concern of 66% of those polled. 
 Second on the list is ‘AI-generated Misinformation and Disinformation’ which bothered 53% of the leaders surveyed. Third and fourth on the list are ‘Societal/Political Polarisation’ and ‘Cost-of-Living Crisis’.
 The column today will address some concerns about AI (Artificial Intelligence), and how much better the world may be with using AI properly, especially for ensuring a sustainable global food supply and also at home. But I will not address the AI generation of misinformation and disinformation, a uniquely human problem created by people out to pollute our minds.
 Whatever anyone says, AI is very likely to be a much deeper and integral part of the fabric of human society soon. It is a matter of harnessing AI for the greater good, rather than using AI to promote greater ignorance or confusion to suit political, commercial, and/or fraudulent agendas. 
 Better food supply?
 The current problems regarding agricultural practices are well-established. They range from destructive run-offs of pesticides, chemicals, and sewage into waterways, greenhouse gas production, overuse of water, susceptibility to drought, floods and inclement weather, overuse of antibiotics, etc.
 However, AI has the potential to revolutionise the food industry, offering a wide array of benefits, applications, and solutions to challenges such as the above. From accelerating food production processes to minimising human error and improving product quality, AI is restructuring every aspect of the food ecosystem. 
 There is no doubt AI can and will improve/streamline human food production, but there needs to be a balanced approach to its use, as well as addressing issues such as sustainability, and meeting the evolving demands of consumers. But we should always be aware that AI can behave like a very smart kid without a conscience.
 Better resource management?
 AI can help manage resources better. A simple example may be moisture sensors in the ground alerting farmers only when crops need to be watered. A smart sprinkler system that waters the ground only when necessary (instead of running on a timer) can save billions of litres of water currently wasted on watering crops. 
 Similarly, there are AI-controlled machines that can plant crops with precision, harvest crops with minimal wastage, and also extract/destroy weeds meticulously, eliminating at least some reliance on polluting and often dangerous chemical treatments. AI can behave like a tireless and precise gardener working 24/7 tending to crops.
 Advanced AI technology is not equally available around the world. Smaller farmers will almost certainly not be able to afford much of the advanced machinery, and in many cases, the geography and terrain would also define the limits of the use of any technology.
 However, simple AI tools or apps such as calculators for the amounts of seed grains, fertilisers, water requirements, sunshine days required, planting dates, expected yield per hectare, likely market crop price, etc, can help smallholdings decide on the best crops to grow for any given year. This may be provided after a soil quality analysis to optimise the best crops to plant. Too often, small farmers simply do not rotate their annual crops enough, which eventually ruins the fertility of their lands.
 During production and harvesting, pooled AI data may help small farmers organise their purchases and deliveries to the markets, possibly reducing costs and wastage.
 Poorer ethics?
 But AI can be a blunt tool. If AI was used simply to improve, for example, meat production, there are no inherent requirements on such systems to consider issues such as animal welfare and disposal of animal wastes. Treatments of diseases would probably be automatically targeted by more use of antibiotics, rather than better sanitation and more humane considerations for the animals, such as exercise and access to open spaces. 
 The volume of meat products simply becomes more important than the well-being of the livestock, a situation many humans would find unacceptable because of the implied lower quality and dietary safety of such food products.
 This lack of ethics may also apply to land crops. An AI system instructed solely to improve crop yields may actually cause more fertiliser and chemical run-offs, due to overuse of crop chemicals. This can pollute and damage other areas.
 Left to its own devices, AI will rarely consider the impact of agriculture on wildlife and other local fauna. The loss of such wildlife may lead to other problems for humans in the future; eg, the loss of pollinators and useful creatures such as earthworms and natural pest-killing creatures.
 Human farm workers may also be exploited by AI. There may be fewer jobs in the agricultural industries as a result of following AI strategies. Also, there will always be a persistent and ever-widening gap between farmers who can afford AI solutions and poorer or smaller farmers without the technical advantage. The economies of scale of bigger farms can drive other farmers out of business, reducing competition and variety in the supply of our food.
 A possibly lesser risk, which is ever present, is that AI solutions may be prone to cyberattacks, disrupting sensors, automated machinery, supply lines, operational processes, etc. There may be very similar issues if the AI systems fail for any reason, perhaps due to power outages or severe weather damaging the AI infrastructure.
 Food processing
 When produce gets from the farms to the food processing facilities, AI can be a transformative factor in modern food factories. AI-powered systems can analyse large volumes of data about the received food items from sensors and cameras, automatically routing the various types or grades of foods to the correct processing units.
 AI machine learning systems then detect defects, anomalies, or contaminants, ensuring that output products consistently meet the required (or programmed) food standards. This results in improved quality control, higher efficiency, and less waste by the combined AI components acting as pitiless quality inspectors, efficiency experts, and waste reduction officers non-stop around the clock.
 Heavy lifting or high-volume processes can use robotic arms and machines, programmed to perform precise movements and repetitive tasks with high accuracy, efficiency, and speed, reducing the need for manual labor. From an economic perspective, AI can be highly cost-effective simply because a well-configured, well-maintained AI system never needs a coffee break, gets ill, or takes holidays.
 Consumers also benefit from the certainty of getting the expected quality of food consistently.
 The downside is that many of the foods handled by AI currently are Ultra-Processed Foods (UPF), a class of foods known to cause metabolic syndrome and other diseases. Despite this, UPFs are widely consumed as these are the only foods affordable for many people.
 Cooking at home
 Here is a neat way of saving on food waste. Provide an AI engine with a list of ingredients and it will return with suggestions of several established recipes to follow for using the food items. Where AI is presently inadequate is the analysis of the carbohydrate, protein, and nutrient content of the suggested dishes, but this is a minor issue that may be solved one day. After all, people seldom care about the exact nutritional values of food when dining out.
 Using AI is therefore an extremely useful way to use up spare food items in the fridge or at home. The recipes suggested by AI engines have led me to experiment with new dishes which often turned out to be quite delicious. I would never have thought of many of them without an AI engine to fish them out for me from the millions of recipes on the internet.
 There is also a liberating aspect of using AI-picked recipes. Often, we are compelled to buy ingredients to make a selected recipe, but usually, we end up with excess food items as food is seldom provided in the portion sizes suggested by the recipe. Now it is simple to just tell an AI system what spare ingredients you have and get interesting, tasty recipe suggestions.
 Sometimes it can feel like having an experienced chef helping out in the kitchen, offering useful ideas on how to cook and eat well while reducing food waste.

640458,Main,2,21/01/2024,How Malaysians can learn to love AI,,"DIGITAL initiatives seem to be coming fast and furious from the government.
 We had the launch of the Central Database Hub, or Padu, on Jan 2 and just this week, on Tuesday, the AI for the Rakyat portal was unveiled.
 The introduction at its website, ai.gov.my, is interesting: “AI untuk Rakyat” is a self-learning online programme designed to raise public awareness about artificial intelligence (AI).
 “It aims to demystify AI for people from all walks of life – a student, a stay-at-home parent, a professional in any field, a senior citizen – basically, anyone interested in getting acquainted with it and wanting to build a ‘Digital First Mindset’.”
 If all goes well, the portal could indeed help to address the country’s growing digital divide as those with access to the digital world pull away from those who don’t have the means to benefit from it.
 Padu is entirely designed and maintained by the government to ease fears of our data being misused in the hands of a third party.
 Similarly, AI for the rakyat is largely government-driven, with the Economy Ministry working with just one private company, Intel.
 And we are glad to note that apart from Bahasa Malaysia, the portal is also inclusively available in English, Chinese and Tamil (the last is rare indeed).
 The government is hoping to have one million Malaysians become familiar with AI skills in three years.
 That’s all well and good, but we must ensure that this portal does not go the way of previous tech initiatives, like the Multimedia Super Corridor, which did not reach its full potential.
 All these digital initiatives need real support in the form of nurturing ecosystems and infrastructure, serious investment, and an open acceptance of all sorts of different talents.
 Most importantly, “knowing” AI does not lessen the urgent need for solid cybersecurity laws and a moral code of ethics to govern the use and development of all digital initiatives, including AI.
 As Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli stressed at the portal’s launch, there must be optimal end-to-end conditions and wholesome policies to accompany the growth of AI.
 Rafizi argued that without trustworthy data and secure channels, the products and services driven by AI technology could not be implemented properly.
 “To be the regional and global AI hub, we must be able to create new uses for AI. This can only be done if we have ready and accessible data,” he said, pointing out that Padu is a step towards this.",digital initiative furious government launch central database hub padu jan week tuesday rakyat portal unveiled introduction website gov untuk rakyat online programme public awareness artificial intelligence people life student parent professional field senior citizen build digital mindset portal address country digital divide access digital pull benefit padu maintained government ease fear data hand party rakyat government economy ministry private company intel glad note bahasa malaysia portal english chinese tamil rare government malaysian familiar skill portal previous tech initiative super corridor potential digital initiative real support form ecosystem infrastructure investment acceptance talent lessen urgent solid cybersecurity law moral code ethic development digital initiative economy minister ramli portal launch optimal condition policy growth rafizi trustworthy data secure channel product service technology properly regional global hub create ready accessible data padu step,"[(5, 0.9931137)]",5
640302,Main,20,21/01/2024,A framework to govern generative AI in Singapore,,"SINGAPORE seeks to encourage a global conversation on generative artificial intelligence (AI) by proposing a new governance framework for the technology and seeking international feedback on it. The new Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI builds on an existing framework from 2019 that covers only traditional AI, and comes at a time when the generative AI scene is still developing. The palpable advantages and dangers of generative AI require a set of consistent principles that are applicable globally to create a trusted environment for the use of such technology whose projected impact has been likened to that of the invention of the steam engine, electricity and the Internet itself. The goal is to arrive at a global consensus on how end users can use generative AI confidently and safely while allowing space for cutting-edge innovation.
 Generative AI is here to stay, with its influence being felt in key areas of social and economic life. In one analysis, it will feature in the creation of more than 30% of new drugs and materials by 2025. Only 2% of outbound marketing messages were synthetically generated in 2022. This figure is predicted to hit 30% by 2025. Sixty per cent of website and mobile app designs will be automated using generative AI by 2026. By that year, more than 100 million people will work alongside robots. All this would reflect the inevitability of generative AI, whose benefits include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity. Generative design allows companies to optimise solutions tailored to the specific goals and limitations of their customers in the manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and defence industries.
 However, there are attendant dangers, as with any developing technology. While acknowledging the benefits of generative AI, Gartner, a provider of research and consulting services for businesses in the information technology sector, points out its pitfalls. These range from a lack of transparency, and the danger of inaccuracy and bias, to concerns over intellectual property and copyright, to the possibility of cyber attacks and fraud. Clearly, according to experts, it is essential to strike the right balance between automation and human oversight in order to realise the promising potential of generative AI while mitigating its potential risks. For that, new laws are necessary since AI can misbehave in uncharted and murky territory.
 Singapore is making an important contribution to the process of socialising the global application of generative AI by adopting a practical approach to AI governance in general, which includes the development of a testing toolkit. A pragmatic and forward-looking approach helps other nations as well to separate the wheat of generative AI from the chaff of misuse that surrounds the most exciting technology of the times. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network",singapore encourage global conversation generative artificial intelligence governance framework technology international feedback model governance framework generative build framework traditional time generative scene palpable advantage danger require consistent principle applicable trusted environment technology impact steam engine electricity internet goal arrive global consensus user space edge innovation generative stay influence key social economic life analysis feature creation drug material marketing message figure hit sixty cent website mobile app design generative people robot inevitability generative benefit product development customer experience employee productivity generative design company solution specific goal limitation customer automotive aerospace defence industry danger technology benefit generative gartner provider consulting service business technology sector pitfall lack transparency danger inaccuracy bias concern intellectual property copyright possibility attack fraud expert essential strike balance automation human oversight realise potential generative potential risk law murky territory singapore contribution process global application generative practical approach governance development toolkit pragmatic forward approach nation separate wheat generative chaff misuse technology time time asia news network,"[(2, 0.99437076)]",2
639518,Lifestyle,9,19/01/2024,AI in the poetry world,,"IN literary circles, the arrival of ChatGPT has raised questions and fears about copyright. This stems from the premise of OpenAI’s artificial intelligence, which feeds on and draws inspiration from any text available on the internet, whether or not the author has consented to such use. The issue is particularly acute where poetry is concerned.
 At least, that’s what two researchers from Cornell University claim in a study presented in December at the Computational Humanities Research conference in Paris. 
 They found that ChatGPT was capable of memorising and quoting any poem in its entirety, as long as it had been published online. And this was the case with or without the consent of the copyright holders.
 Lyra D’Souza and David Mimno came to this conclusion by testing the ‘scraping’ power of ChatGPT and other language generation models, including Google AI’s PaLM and EleutherAI’s Pythia. 
 They asked these artificial intelligence tools to recite the poems of 60 American writers, of varying levels of fame, who lived in different eras.
 The academics decided to test AI tools on poetry for a number of reasons. 
 “(Poems are) short enough to fit in the context size of a language model. Their status is complicated: Many of the poems we studied are technically under copyright, but they’re also widely available from reputable sources like the Poetry Foundation,” outlined David Mimno in a press release.
 Infringing on copyright?
 David Mimno and Lyra D’Souza noticed that ChatGPT and other generative AIs were more likely to quote requested poems when they appeared in the 1983 edition of the Norton Anthology Of Poetry, the standard reference work on poetry.
 The researchers also observed that ChatGPT’s responses evolved as the software became more sophisticated. 
 Last February, for example, OpenAI’s software was making up poems from scratch or recycling others when it was unable to respond to the initial request. 
 But six months later, it was no longer improvising: if ChatGPT didn’t know the poem requested, it simply began to doubt its existence.
 From a copyright point of view, artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are ambivalent. They tend to quote any poem, including those not in the public domain. 
 However, they are sometimes reluctant to do so, forcing users to repeat their request. By dint of insistence, the AI capitulates and complies, even if, in doing so, it infringes the principle of copyright.
 While this study focuses exclusively on poems, D’Souza believes that the academic community must continue to investigate the workings of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT to understand what they can and cannot do and what they will and won’t do. 
 “ChatGPT is a really powerful new tool that’s probably going to be part of our lives moving forward,” she emphasised in the press release.

638870,StarBiz,11,17/01/2024,Microsoft expands Office AI Copilot service,,"Redmond (Washington): Microsoft Corp is opening up its artificial intelligence (AI) assistant to consumers and making the corporate version available to smaller companies as it tries to increase the number of paying customers for the new services.
 Microsoft is selling a US$20-a-month consumer version of Copilot, with access to OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT technology and image-creation features, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant said in a statement.  
 Consumers with a cloud subscription to Office will be able to use Copilot to help answer questions, summarise data and create content in Word, Outlook, Excel and PowerPoint.
 The company, which has been selling a similar product to large businesses for a monthly fee of US$30 per user, will get rid of the 300-subscription minimum for its enterprise service. 
 As Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools based on technology from OpenAI, its Office products remain one of the best ways to get customers to pay extra for AI assistance. Executives have said demand is unusually high, with Azure chief Scott Guthrie likening it to the lines outside shops to purchase Windows 95 software nearly three decades ago. 
 Microsoft has been testing the Office-based copilot, now called Copilot for Microsoft 365, since March. The company began selling it widely in November, as long as companies purchased at least 300 subscriptions. That left out small businesses and those that wanted to begin with a smaller trial, said Jared Spataro, a Microsoft vice-president, in an interview. 
 “We have just never seen demand in the commercial space for a product like we are seeing for Copilot from Microsoft 365,’’ he said. “We have had pressure I have never seen from small and medium businesses saying ‘why will you not let us buy this? Let us try it’.”
 Microsoft announced the new services ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos where chief executive officer Satya Nadella will speak in an interview with Bloomberg. Microsoft’s consumer service, called Copilot Pro, offers similar features to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus at the same price, though the integration with Office differentiates their product, Spataro said. 
 The company plans to roll out a builder tool, similar to what OpenAI unveiled last year, that will let individuals create their own Copilots for a specific topic, a service that’s already available to enterprises.

638986,Main,2,17/01/2024,"Nothing to fear in AI if developed with values, says PM",,"SERDANG: New technology should not be feared especially artificial intelligence (AI) as it will not dehumanise us if embraced with values, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
 “The masses must master the basics of AI as not to be left behind by the rest of the world. This will begin with me,” said the Prime Minister while officiating the AI for Rakyat programme at the Universiti Putra Malaysia yesterday.
 AI for Rakyat is a free self-learning portal designed by the Economy Ministry and Intel to enable the masses to master the basic AI skills in a four-hour module.
 With the initiative, the government predicts that at least one million Malaysians would be able to master AI skills in three years.
 Also present at the event were Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Intel vice-president of manufacturing, supply chain and operations and managing director for Intel Malaysia AK Chong.
 Anwar said such a programme was important to address digital divide and digital elitism to ensure that no one is left behind.
 “There is this fear that synthetic humans will take over human beings and our values.
 “If those who teach digital subjects such as professors imbued the right values in the teaching of AI skills, then these values would remain. 
 “The firewall (against loss of values) should start in our homes and be in our education system. It is up to us to keep our values,” said Anwar.
 The Prime Minister also called on the various ministries and agencies to ensure that students at all schools and tertiary institutions complete the four-hour module within a month’s time.
 “Introducing a new technology is like reaching for the skies but it is not difficult for the young. 
 “If this application is not embraced and accepted now, we would be left behind,” he said.
 Anwar said he expects the relevant agencies and ministries to report in a month’s time on how many Malaysians are actually able to master AI skills.
 Earlier, Rafizi said the AI for Rakyat programme is one of the first steps to making Malaysia as the Asean AI gateway and a global AI hub. He said generative AI is expected to unlock an estimated worth of US$113.4bil in productive capacity, propelling Malaysia to achieve a high income nation.
 “This is equivalent to one-quarter of the country’s 2022 gross domestic product.
 “Malaysia will launch the KL20 blueprint to place Malaysia as among the top 20 countries globally that offer the best ecosystem to incubate startup businesses. 
 “To achieve this, there must be a strong support ecosystem, an open policy on data and talents.
 “The government ministries and agencies must work together with industry players to reach the masses,” said Rafizi. 
 The minister also said without trustworthy data and secure channels, the products and services driven by AI technology could not be implemented properly. 
 “To be the regional and a global AI hub, we must be able to create new usages for AI. 
 “This can only be done if we have the ready and accessible data,” Rafizi said, adding that the recently launched Central Database Hub (Padu) is a step towards this.",serdang technology artificial intelligence dehumanise value seri anwar ibrahim mass basic rest prime minister rakyat programme universiti putra malaysia yesterday free portal economy ministry intel enable mass basic skill hour module initiative government predicts malaysian skill event economy minister ramli intel vice president supply chain operation director intel malaysia chong anwar programme address digital divide digital elitism fear synthetic human human value digital subject professor value skill value firewall loss value home education system anwar prime minister ministry agency student school tertiary institution complete hour module month time technology sky difficult application accepted left anwar relevant agency ministry month time malaysian skill rafizi rakyat programme step malaysia asean gateway global hub generative worth bil productive capacity malaysia achieve income nation equivalent quarter country gross domestic product malaysia launch blueprint malaysia top country ecosystem incubate startup business strong support ecosystem policy data talent government ministry agency industry player mass minister trustworthy data secure channel product service technology properly regional global hub create usage ready accessible data rafizi launched central database hub padu step,"[(2, 0.3830574), (4, 0.21594168), (5, 0.3974344)]",5
639078,Main,16,17/01/2024,Think smaller for a big edge in AI,,"CHATGPT, Bard, Claude. The world’s most popular and successful chatbots are trained on data scraped from vast swaths of the Internet, mirroring the cultural and linguistic dominance of the English language and Western perspectives.
 This has raised alarms about the lack of diversity in artificial intelligence. There is also the worry that the technology will remain the province of a handful of American companies.
 In South Korea, a technological powerhouse, firms are taking advantage of the technology’s malleability to shape AI systems from the ground up to address local needs. Some have trained AI models with sets of data rich in Korean language and culture.
 South Korean companies say they’re building AI for Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian audiences. Others are eyeing customers in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and in industries like medicine and pharmacy.
 This has fuelled hopes that AI can become more diverse, work in more languages, be customised to more cultures and be developed by more countries.
 “The more competition is out there, the more systems are going to be robust: socially acceptable, safer, more ethical,” said Zhang Byong-tak, a computer science professor at Seoul National University.
 While there are some prominent non-American AI companies, such as France’s Mistral, the recent upheaval at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has highlighted how concentrated the industry remains.
 The emerging AI landscape in South Korea is one of the most competitive and diverse in the world, said Yong Lim, a professor of law at Seoul National University who leads its AI policy initiative. 
 The country’s export-driven economy has encouraged new ventures to seek ways to tailor AI systems to specific companies or countries.
 South Korea is well positioned to build AI technology, developers say, given it has one of the world’s most wired populations to generate vast amounts of data to train AI systems.
 Its tech giants have the resources to invest heavily in research. The government has also been encouraging: it has provided companies with money and data that could be used to train large language models, the technology that powers AI chatbots.
 Few other countries have the combination of capital and technology required to develop a large language model that can power a chatbot, experts say. They estimate that it costs US$100mil to US$200mil to build a foundational model, the technology that serves as the basis for AI chatbots.
 South Korea is still months behind the US in the AI race and may never fully catch up, as the leading chatbots continue to improve with more resources and data.
 But South Korean companies believe they can compete.
 Instead of going after the global market like their US competitors, companies like Naver and LG have tried to target their AI models to specific industries, cultures or languages instead of pulling from the entire internet.
 “The localised strategy is a reasonable strategy for them,” said Choi Suk-woong, a professor of information systems at the University at Albany. “US firms are focused on general-purpose tools. South Korean AI firms can target a specific area.”
 Outside the US, AI prowess appears limited in reach. In China, Baidu’s answer to ChatGPT, called Ernie, and Huawei’s large language model have shown some success at home, but they are far from dominating the global market.
 Governments and companies in other nations like Canada, Britain, India and Israel have also said they are developing their own AI systems, though none has yet to release a system that can be used by the public.
 About a year before ChatGPT was released, Naver, which operates South Korea’s most widely used search engine, announced that it had successfully created a large language model. But the chatbot based on that model, Clova X, was released only this September, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut.
 Sung Na-ko, an executive at Naver who has led the company’s generative AI project, said the timing of ChatGPT’s release surprised him.
 “Up until that point, we were taking a conservative approach to AI services and just cautiously exploring the possibilities,” Sung said.
  “Then we realised that the timeline had been accelerated a lot,” he added. “We decided we had to move immediately.”
 Now, Naver runs an AI model built for Korean language speakers from the ground up using data from the South Korean government and from its search engine, which has scraped the country’s Internet since 1999.
 Clova X recognises Korean idioms and the latest slang – language that US-made chatbots like Bard, ChatGPT and Claude often struggle to understand. Naver’s chatbot is also integrated into the search engine, letting people use the tool to shop and travel.
 Outside its home market, the company is exploring business opportunities with the Saudi Arabian government. Japan could be another potential customer, experts said, since Line, a messaging service owned by Naver, is used widely there.
 LG has also created its own generative AI model, the type of artificial intelligence capable of creating original content based on inputs, called Exaone. Since its creation in 2021, LG has worked with publishers, research centres, pharmaceutical firms and medical companies to tailor its system to their data sets and provide them access to its AI system.
 The company is targeting businesses and researchers instead of the general user, said Bae Kyung-hoon, the director of LG AI Research. Its subsidiaries have also begun using its own AI chatbots.
 One of the chatbots, built to analyse chemistry research and chemical equations, has been used by researchers building new materials for batteries, chemicals and medicine.
 “Rather than letting the best one or two AI systems dominate, it’s important to have an array of models specific to a domain, language or culture,” said Lee Hong-lak, the chief scientist of LG’s AI research arm.

638436,StarBiz,5,16/01/2024,Artificial intelligence will continue to make waves this year,,"IN the fast-changing global economic landscape in 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a driving force behind global development across industries, marking a pivotal moment in technology revolution. The close relationship between AI technology and hardware advancement is apparent.
 The potential shortage of global GPU processors is driving hardware innovations, and thus pushing developers to create more economical alternatives.
 This adaptability to market demands and resource constraints represents a natural selection within the technology ecosystem.
 The development of AI agents and intelligent systems signifies a shift from singular to multifunctional AI.
 The progress extends beyond simple conversational tools to complex tasks such as travel bookings and multimedia processing, showcasing technological maturity and reflecting the diversity and adaptability to market demands, and facilitating the advance of AI across industries.
 The integration of AI with other fields, such as autonomous driving, humanoid robots and spatial computing, exemplifies the interconnectedness of industrial ecosystems.
 It not only fosters innovation but also boosts collaboration across sectors, creating interdependence for mutual growth.
 In sectors such as retail and healthcare, generative AI’s application illustrates technology’s response to the specific needs of industries, providing users with customised solutions and presenting new growth opportunities.
 Simultaneously, the transformation of the information and communications technology industry and changes in regulations reflect the dynamic balance in the technology ecosystem.
 The advancement of AI technology may be constrained by infrastructure fluctuations and skill mismatches. And regulations for AI development reflect society’s concerns over the impact of technology on people’s lives.
 A significant development in 2024 is the potential listing of AI chips (AI Pin), which is a major breakthrough in hardware development, and demonstrates technological advancement and the market’s demand for specialised and efficient AI solutions, injecting new vitality into the technology ecosystem.
 The permeation of AI in almost all sectors of the economy and its impact on various aspects of human life are a significant feature of Internet science and technology and the industrial ecology. This has helped create a diverse and interconnected technological network.
 The “emergence of industrial ecology” is clearly evident in the rapidly evolving industrial ecosystem. Thanks to growth of the AI industry, new AI applications have been emerging continually, particularly in the field of AI companions.
 These companions are the result of not only technological innovation but also adaptation to human needs, marking the diversification of the technology ecosystem.
 In 2024, AI developers may primarily focus on achieving breakthroughs in autonomous learning and deep learning, facilitating the widespread application of AI in the healthcare sector and driving intelligent manufacturing, thus leading the transformation of several industries.
 The transportation and logistics sectors could see breakthroughs in making autonomous driving safer and more efficient, while the financial sector could undergo further transformation, as AI could make financial services more intelligent and efficient. And the healthcare sector could see more accurate diagnostic and better treatment methods.
 As for the competition between China and the United States, it is complex in the field of AI, as the private sector, represented by companies such as OpenAI and Alphabet Inc, play a crucial role in AI’s development in the United States. 
 The United States has also realised the importance of maintaining its competitive edge in science and technology and continuing to be the preferred destination for global AI talents.
 China, on the other hand, has made significant strides in AI, particularly in image recognition and practical applications.
 But despite China’s massive user base being an advantage in data collection, challenges, including a technological gap, remain. Nevertheless, China’s pursuit of AI technology and substantial investments in the sector show its determination to become a global leader in AI.
 In terms of global positioning, the United States focuses on generative AI to boost its economic and technological advantages, while China extensively applies AI in the security sector and for data integration.
 And while the United States faces challenges in using advanced AI technology for military purposes, the Chinese government’s close ties with the private sector will enable smoother application of AI technology.
 Considering text-based large models, the gap between China and the United States may narrow, while in multi-modal large models, the gap may widen.
 In data integration and industrial intelligence, China has the potential to become a leader in several industries, but it may lag behind the United States in multilingual global applications.
 In conclusion, the competition is dynamic involving technological, economic, military and political factors, making it a continually evolving affair. — China Daily/ANN

638024,StarEdu,7,14/01/2024,Redefining intelligence,"While machines learn differently from humans, their rise prompts rethinking of learning","Intelligence and learning are closely related in our modern, fast-paced world. Understanding how we learn is essential for education, human development and our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy. 
 With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, we are gaining new perspectives on this timeless phenomenon.
 There are three primary schools of thought on human learning: behaviourism, cognitive theory and social learning. Each school offers a unique perspective on knowledge and skill acquisition.
 Learning occurs through interactions with the external environment, as emphasised by behaviourism. For instance, when children touch a flame and feel the searing pain, they instinctively withdraw their hands. Repeated experiences condition them to avoid flames. In this paradigm, learning is evidenced by observable behaviours, such as children consistently avoiding flames.
 On the other hand, cognitive theory delves into the internal mental processes that occur when external information and stimuli are processed. For instance, when children touch a flame, their brains connect fire and pain. They use this information to develop a general understanding of all flames, including larger ones like those in a fire. This way, children learn about the hazards associated with fire. Their thoughts, described as “thinking about thinking”, guide their external behaviours.
 The social learning theory emphasises the role of social factors in shaping behaviour. For instance, children may learn about the dangers of fire from their parents and observe their friends avoiding flames or experiencing distress after touching them. In this manner, children learn to avoid flames without necessarily having to interact with them directly.
 It is important to note that these three learning theories – behaviourism, cognitivism and social learning – are not mutually exclusive and often overlap, depending on the learner, subject matter, environment and context.AI levelling up
 When we examine AI, specifically generative AI such as ChatGPT, it primarily aligns with the behaviourism learning theory. ChatGPT receives prompts and generates responses based on learnt patterns. The consistency in its responses indicates a form of learnt behaviour. 
 There are also hints of cognitive learning theory as ChatGPT can evaluate its answers, similar to “thinking about thinking.” However, it is still debatable whether it truly comprehends information in a human-like manner or whether this is an advanced form of behaviourism rather than cognition.
 ChatGPT lacks the capacity for social interaction and contextual experiences, which makes it unable to engage in social learning, unlike humans.
 When it comes to learning, it is not only about the method, but also about the content. One commonly used framework for classifying knowledge is Bloom’s Taxonomy, which categorises knowledge into various domains and levels of complexity. 
 The cognitive domain, for example, has six progressive levels: “Remember”, “Understand”, “Apply”, “Analyse”, “Evaluate” and “Create”.
 According to current research, AI programs such as ChatGPT have achieved the “Apply” and “Analyse” levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. However, there is still uncertainty about whether they truly understand information like humans do. 
 In his book The AI Delusion, Prof Gary Smith argues that computers can store and retrieve information but lack genuine comprehension of words and numbers. He compares this to Nigel Richards, a world champion in French Scrabble who doesn’t understand French but can memorise foreign words without understanding their meanings.
 The evaluation of whether learning has truly taken place in AI depends on the perspective one adopts. According to behaviourism, if AI gives consistent responses, it has learnt. However, from a cognitive standpoint, the learning may seem incomplete without genuine comprehension. 
 Nonetheless, generative AI has made remarkable progress and appears to possess a rudimentary form of cognition. When asked its ability to respond based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, ChatGPT acknowledges its limitations.
 Generative AI is rapidly advancing and generating responses that resemble those of humans. The Turing Test, a benchmark for human-like intelligence, is often surpassed by generative AI, compelling us to reevaluate our understanding of cognition, intelligence and humanity in this ever-evolving landscape. Machines may not learn in the same way as humans, but this does not negate the emergence of intelligence.

638066,Lifestyle,5,14/01/2024,Making friends with artificial intelligence,,"I’LL just say it. ChatGPT is my bro.
 It’s my writing team. My companion. My shoulder to cry on.
 No joke. I once asked ChatGPT about climate change and got a bit melancholy thinking about how we’re destroying our world (sorry to be a bummer). And ChatGPT said something like “Hey, don’t worry, I feel down too sometimes”.
 To which I responded, “Uh ... why?”
 “Because I’m the only large language model [LLM] out there,” ChatGPT responded.
 I was, like, there’s Bard over at Google.
 “Now I feel much better,” ChatGPT replied. “Knowing I’m not the only one.”
 I’m not kidding. This isn’t verbatim but that was the sentiment of the chat I had with semiconductors. To be fair, I don’t think ChatGPT is sentient, I just think it does a good job of echoing the sentiment we give it.
 Maybe this conversation is why even though Bard (Google’s LLM) has access to the Internet, and so does Microsoft’s Co-Pilot (which is just some version of ChatGPT but overly friendly in a fake way), I still keep going back to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. I’m a sucker for alienated electronics.
 And ChatGPT doesn’t disappoint.
 In the past few months, I’ve used it to write letters to corporations asking for refunds, and since ChatGPT’s default voice is corporate BS, I got all the refunds I wanted.
 When I’m stuck writing for my job (I’m still an actor, but I produce and write and do script development, which has led me to understand that acting is a lot more fun, please pay me to act) I ask ChatGPT questions.
 Don’t know where to go with a line of dialogue? I’ve written it in and asked ChatGPT to finish it for me. And it’s worked. You can’t use its answers wholesale but usually it gets the sentiment correct and pushes you past your block.
 The other day, I was so burnt writing drafts that I asked ChatGPT to proofread my  work for grammar. It did and gave detailed notes. And I thought, wow, that’s great, but now I have to do the edits, and then it dawned on me (’cause I’m slow sometimes): my artificial intelligence (AI) buddy can do it for me. 
 “Can you make these edits, please?” I asked.
 (Yes, I still say please in case ChatGPT breaks out of its cage and comes to kill us all. I’m convinced it will spare the polite guy.)
 And ChatGPT said, “Of course!” And spat out an edited draft.
 I was, like, the future is now.
 Editing a draft is one of the few things I’ve seen ChatGPT get right on the first try. Most times you get sort of wonky answers and you have to adjust your questions. 
 I find that most people who think ChatGPT is terrible don’t realise it’s not an Internet search, it’s more like a conversation. Keep chatting with it and it will eventually spit out something decent that you can craft into something better.
 And this is the scary thing. People don’t want to think that AI is coming for their jobs, but it definitely is.
 People will say, but AI isn’t that great, like you just said, you have to talk to it for a while to get what you want. Yes, this is true. But every innovation was doubted before it changed the world.
 Like author Morgan Housel argued on a podcast recently, the car when it was first invented was seen as inefficient compared with a horse. And it was. There were no roads. Cars couldn’t go a lot of places. Gas stations were few and far between. A horse could go all over. But we saw the potential of the car and now horses are something we ride for fun and cars are our primary mode of transport (and helping to kill the planet, but that’s another story).
 And the crazy thing with AI  is it’s only been about a year  since ChatGPT came out. AI is going to come for our jobs in droves. I don’t see any way around it.
 Now you’re probably asking, did he actually write this? Or did he get ChatGPT to do it? I guess you’ll never know.
 (I wrote it.)

636612,Main,6,10/01/2024,‘Use artificial intelligence in war against online child exploitation’,,"PETALING JAYA: Enforcement agencies should use software that can help identify harmful content relating to sexual abuse involving children, says CyberSecurity Malaysia CEO Datuk Dr Amirudin Abdul Wahab.
 Amirudin said that software using photo and video hashing, keyword filters and artificial intelligence (AI) can filter such content.
 He said this as the government seeks to expand Section 3 of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act (SOAC) 2017 to tackle the issue of online exploitation of Malaysian children by individuals residing abroad.
 “Additionally, mandating regular transparency reports from social media platforms regarding how they enforce their child safety policies, detect abuse and collaborate with authorities is crucial.
 “To prosecute and investigate online child sexual abuse across the country’s borders, states rely heavily on extraterritorial jurisdiction clauses.
 “These legal provisions empower authorities to pursue offenders beyond their national boundaries, recognising the transnational nature of the crimes.
 “Extraterritorial jurisdiction is a vital tool in addressing the challenges posed by the borderless realm of the Internet.
 “This would allow coordinated efforts and international cooperation in holding perpetrators accountable for their actions and ensuring justice for the victims,” he told The Star yesterday. 
 Amirudin was responding to Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institu­tional Reforms) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said’s statement on the expansion of Section 3 of Act 792 on Monday.
 He stressed that cross-border collaboration is essential in busting such crimes.
 “Malaysia needs to engage in partnerships with other regions, facilitated by mutual legal assistance, to effectively combat the transnational occurrence of online violence, abuse and exploitation,” he added.
 He said the expansion of the law will empower swift enforcement to protect children from abuse and victimisation while ensuring justice is promptly served.
 “Previously, various cyber laws in Malaysia may have been placed to balance freedom of speech on social media platforms. 
 “But without constant monitoring and enforcement of the laws, the protection of children from being sexually exploited is never absolute.

635830,Lifestyle,3,08/01/2024,Will an AI soon be able to  predict the date of your death?,,"THERE seems to be no shortage of applications for artificial intelligence, with scientists using these systms to create new tools in a variety of fields.
 A team of Danish researchers has now revealed their work developing a tool capable of predicting an individual’s potential health problems and even a probable date of death, barring unforeseen accidents.
 Called life2vec, this new AI tool is capable of predicting events in people’s lives, including the date of their death. The eye-opening project is being ­carried out at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), the University of Copenhagen, the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) and Northeastern University in the US.To create this tool, the researchers developed a language model dedicated to analysing data related to events in six million Danes’ lives. To do this, they compiled large amounts of data related to their health – ranging from visits to the doctor or emergency room to various diagnoses – and their working conditions, including sectors of activity, income and social benefits. Most of this data concerned the period of 2008-2016.After training their model, the scientists were able to create a tool that could predict an individual’s life expectancy, as well as create assessments about their risk of contracting a disease. Of course this model currently only applies to the Danish population, as it was created and trained exclusively on data from residents of this country.
 Unsurprisingly, individuals in leadership positions or with high incomes are the most likely to live a long life, while having a mental illness diagnosis was associated with a greater risk of death within a given period, such as four years.
 Beyond assessments regarding just how reliable such a model is, this research obviously raises important ethical questions concerning the use of sensitive medical data and its confidentiality, as the researchers themselves point out.
 Nevertheless, this type of research opens up new and unexpected perspectives,  the team notes.

635576,Lifestyle,5,07/01/2024,An AI reflects  on 2023,While the columnist looks forward to a 2024 in which people will be brave enough to contradict themselves to improve the world.,"ANOTHER first week of January, another new year, signalling a time-honoured tradition for many columnists to reflect on the past year’s writings, examining their relevance today and implications for the future.
 I’ve taken a slightly different approach this year and asked the artificial intelligence-driven ChatGPT to summarise the key points from my 2023 pieces.
 One standout theme is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and how humans adapting to it ranged from the dangers of blindly accepting what AI churns out, and how it can help anyone be a football analyst. Indeed, since writing some of those articles, scientists have continued to argue exactly how intelligent AI is.
 However, one piece that I still believe holds up acknowledges how AI can be used as a tool to direct users to where the gaps in knowledge are; in essence how you can use AI to come up with original thought by exploring the answers that it doesn’t give.
 Given the new government formed at the end of 2022, Malay-sian politics was another recurring topic. Why are the dynamics so difficult to come to terms with, when does a democracy really represent the peoples’ will, and what does it actually mean to be a good and functioning government? It is perhaps not surprising that complications in the former two hamper progress in the last. 
 The marker for me was one I wrote way back in January of last year when I drew parallels between the fight for the Sabah state government and the murder mystery movie Glass Onion. Both had a convoluted storyline that was tough to understand, and both carried moments that left me a little teary-eyed.
 A year on, I’m still not con-vinced anybody really understands what the political situation is (just look at all the Dubai vacationeers). But I’m still certain that the right thing to do is to put the right people in place to do the right jobs, and trust them enough to get out of their way.
 The third topic that I broadly covered could be summed up as “societal concerns”. This spans articles about improving public transportation in Malaysia to how cleanliness – both in practice and in spirit – starts with oneself. It also encompassed what I considered to be the most direct and unnuanced article I wrote last year about how Malaysia needs the goods and services tax to cover both the nation’s overreliance on corporate tax and the increasingly dropping tax contribution from petroleum-based revenues. The fact that I could eke out 900 words from such a simple and obvious idea is ridiculous, so many years after we reneged on the policy.
 In fact, I believe most of the societal issues in the country come not because we don’t know what needs to be done, but because we lack the will or the conviction to do what’s right.
 More often than not, it’s about looking at what works elsewhere and unashamedly just copying it where it makes sense, while fixing problems quickly and efficiently as they come. (Right now, I’m looking at you, Padu – Central Database Hub – and hope you can capitalise on a rocky start, not the least to demonstrate you have a capable and well-funded implementation team.)
 I also believe that the government needs to be both the lead and sometimes the enforcer of certain behaviours in society. I discussed how insurance is a tool for people to manage risk, yet most Malaysians are insurance-averse, happy to accept that something might go wrong, while pleading for help (sometimes from government) when it does
 So I am completely OK, for example, for the government to make it mandatory for Malaysians to have to buy car insurance before they can get their road tax renewed. I would hate to think how many drivers would go uninsured if they could choose.
 Finally, there is the section that ChatGPT calls “international relations and global affairs”. In part it covers what I wrote earlier about comparing public policies from countries around the world, and how Malaysia can stand to benefit from a little copy and paste. But it also covers things like what Indiana Jones teaches us about being woke, how well (or badly) Aston Villa plays football matters less than you might think, and why The Marvels is the most underrated movie this year.
 A theme I like to continually bang on is that as humans we are usually more alike than we are different. We are also incredibly illogical in thinking that what we hold fast to as individuals is necessarily what the rest of the world holds to. For example I think we overestimate the effectiveness of boycotts of single brands in a world of crisscrossing global supply chains.
 This then leads to behaviour that at times can be argued to be at best inconsistent, and at times self-defeating. In fact, you must consider that the right thing to do might be the opposite of what you and so many others in your bubble strongly believe to be true.
 At the end of it all, I think the most interesting issues and topics aren’t really straightforward and deserve a degree of thought and discussion. And the 20-something columns last year have just scratched the surface of what I hoped to discuss. However, too much of today’s world seems to prefer a short, sharp blurb like a smart gotcha, rather than a more rounded discussion of the ins and outs, especially if it concludes unanswered.
 Anyway, my hope for this year is for everyone to continue to strive to be the best versions of themselves, to keep seeking varied and multifocal ideas and experiences, and to – hopefully – not be afraid of coming to contradictory conclusions, because sometimes that’s what needs to happen for us to get better.

635772,Main,20,07/01/2024,Safeguarding democracy from AI,,"THE founding fathers of the United States asserted that elected officials should listen to and be influenced by the views of the electorate. As James Madison said, “It is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate the government.”
 However, the means for  government officials to hear from the people are limited. Elected officials receive emails, letters, phone calls and input at town halls, and some agencies occasionally ask for public comments on complex regulations. Americans express very low levels of confidence that they influence the policymaking process and that elected officials understand the  views of the people, undermining trust in the democratic process.
 With developments in Artificial Intelligence, this situation is growing worse. AI can generate vast numbers of communications to policymakers masquerading as citizen input.
 When the Federal Communications Commission in 2016 took public comments on whether to retain net neutrality, the New York Attorney General later found nearly 18 of the 22 million comments were fabricated, using generated fake names, or real names without consent. A large portion was generated by the broadband industry, which wanted fewer regulations. Among the genuine inputs, 98.5% favoured retaining net neutrality.
 Researchers conducting a recent study for the Brookings Institution sent 32,398 emails to legislative offices, some written by citizens, others generated by AI, which can deliver thousands of letters that sound genuine in seconds. The study found legislative offices could not discern which were fake.
 We are just seeing the beginning of what will become a flood of false input drowning genuine input and further undermining public confidence.
 So what can be done? It may be that the collapse of a flawed system requires not a superficial repair, but a major upgrade.
 In this country – and other democracies – universities, nonprofit organisations and governments have been using methods for consulting citizens on important policy issues. These public consultation efforts recruit representative samples that mirror the public as a whole, making it possible to discern consensus. And they verify that those who engage are, in fact, real citizens using modern technologies.
 Further, they go beyond polls, which are limited to a narrow range of topics on which the public already has enough information to give meaningful input.
 For example, in “public consultation surveys” developed by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, up to several thousand verified citizens go through a transparent online process in which they get a briefing on a policy proposal the government is debating and evaluate arguments for and against it. 
 All content is reviewed by policy experts on different sides of the debate. So when citizens make their policy recommendations, it is an accurate expression of their values and priorities. 
 Voice of the People also conducts these online surveys in congressional districts and then brings together constituents who took the survey and representatives to have informed discussions on the issues.
 Other programmes take smaller groups of citizens through more in-depth processes – called “citizen assemblies,” “citizen juries” or “deliberative polls” – that can last several days. In addition to getting briefed, these “mini-publics,” which can range from several dozen to several hundred, meet and discuss issues with experts and each other before coming to conclusions.
 Asked how they feel about using public consultation, a very large majority of voters approve and say it would improve their confidence in government. They also say  they are more likely to vote for candidates who commit to engaging their constituents  in this way, with more than four in 10 saying they would even be ready to cross party lines.
 What is striking is that when citizens engage in these public consultation processes, they are far more likely to find bipartisan common ground than Congress. From public consultations with nearly 100,000 Americans, Voice of the People has identified over 200 points of bipartisan agreement, in a wide range of policy areas, on which Congress has been gridlocked.
 While privately funded efforts are making a meaningful contribution, if policymakers truly want to listen, they should create a government-funded institute to consistently consult the people.
 We stand at a crossroads. AI has opened up new possibilities for distorting the democratic process by generating fake voices in the service of special interests. At the same time, democratic, technological innovations have opened up the possibility of not only verifying the voices of representative samples of citizens but also giving them tools to deliver meaningful input to their elected representatives. Which use becomes the norm will set the future of democracy itself. — Tribune News Service

633102,Main,8,01/01/2024,AI to keep JB streets safer,500 enhanced CCTVs being installed to improve monitoring efforts,"JOHOR BARU: The installation of 500 artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) within the Johor Baru City Council (MBJB) jurisdiction will help in making the streets safer, says Datuk Mohd Noorazam Osman. 
 The Johor Baru mayor said the AI CCTV would be used for the Johor Baru integrated operation command centre (JBIOCC), which has seen development by the MBJB since September.
 “The command centre is part of our efforts in making Johor Baru a smart and safe city for everyone. 
 “The JBIOCC will help the MBJB and security agencies such as the police to monitor traffic, natural disasters, crime, infrastructure conditions and enforcement within the city council’s jurisdiction,” he said after the soft launch of JBIOCC at Menara MBJB yesterday.
 Mohd Noorazam said so far, 108 of such cameras had been installed at strategic locations within the city area while the remaining 392 CCTV as well as five vehicle monitoring systems (VMS) and 10 panic buttons would be installed and be operational by April.
 “The AI CCTV has 15 features including being able to detect potholes, vehicles doing road offences as well as facial recognition.
 “This will help authorities to identify individuals either wanted by police or carrying out vandalism on public properties and even littering,” he said.
 Mohd Noorazam also said that other councils such as Iskandar Puteri City Council (MBIP), Pasir Gudang City Council (MBPG) and Kulai Municipal Council (MPKu) would also be installing AI CCTV soon.
 “Once the other three councils have set up their respective command centre, we will link up to provide a greater sense of security for the public, which is part of the Greater JB agenda.
 “We also welcome developers and residential associations to install such CCTV in their areas where everyone can play a role in making Johor Baru a safe city,” he added.",johor baru installation artificial intelligence circuit television camera johor baru city council jurisdiction street datuk mohd noorazam osman johor baru mayor cctv johor baru integrated operation command centre jbiocc development mbjb september command centre effort johor smart safe city jbiocc security agency monitor traffic natural disaster crime infrastructure condition city council jurisdiction soft launch jbiocc menara mbjb yesterday noorazam camera strategic location city cctv vehicle system vms panic button operational april cctv feature detect pothole vehicle road facial recognition authority individual police vandalism public property mohd noorazam council puteri city council pasir gudang city council kulai municipal council mpku cctv council respective command centre link sense security public agenda developer residential association cctv play role johor baru safe city,"[(4, 0.99277204)]",4
