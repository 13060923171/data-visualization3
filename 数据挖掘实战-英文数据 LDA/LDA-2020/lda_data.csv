230571,Lifestyle,4,14/12/2020,State of the art AI,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) has already proven capable of producing music and novels, but now a student at Princeton University in the United States has shown that 
it can also create Chinese landscape paintings that are good enough to fool human evaluators – sometimes.As part of her undergraduate research, Alice Xue studied whether a machine could pass a Visual Turing Test by producing images that people cannot tell were made by a machine. 
Xue trained an algorithm using 2,192 traditional Chinese landscape paintings collected from art museums. 
The resulting AI-generated paintings were mistaken for being made by humans 55% of the time.
Xue graduated earlier this year, but the research was just made public in November when published on the online scientific paper repository arXiv. It was first reported in the AI industry publication Synced this week.
The AI algorithm produced the artwork using a machine learning framework model called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
GANs have previously been used for turning photographs into paintings and creating other types of art, some of which have even been sold at auction.
One AI-generated painting from the French art collective Obvious sold for US$432,500 (RM1.75mil) at a Christie’s auction in 2018. 
Like Xue’s AI-generated art, that painting of a man with blurred, indistinguishable facial features was generated by an algorithm trained on thousands of other paintings. 
In this case, it was fed 15,000 portraits from between the 14th and 20th centuries.
Xue’s research was also original in its choice of artwork. 
“Most GAN research focuses on Western art,” Xue wrote in the paper. 
She said this is why she chose to focus on Chinese landscape paintings, which are “just as aesthetically meaningful as Western art”.
For the Visual Turing Test, Xue surveyed 242 participants. The selection process and the participants’ knowledge of art was not specified in the study. 
They were each asked whether they thought a painting was made by a person or computer and how certain they were on a scale of one to 10.
Xue said her algorithm is also unique in its ability to create artwork from beginning to end. 
The traditional GAN-based method of creating artwork tends to produce unoriginal artwork, according to Xue, because it relies on inputs like pre-prepared sketches.
For this research, Xue used a version of the framework called Sketch-and-Paint GAN (SAPGAN). 
This trained the algorithm to make its own sketches of the landscape’s mountains and rivers before painting in the details.
The results, according to Xue, could help lay the groundwork for future machine-made artwork that is truly original. – South China Morning Post",artificial intelligence capable music novel princeton university united create chinese landscape painting human evaluator undergraduate alice xue machine pas visual test image people machine xue algorithm traditional chinese landscape painting museum painting human time xue public online scientific paper repository arxiv industry publication week algorithm artwork machine framework model generative adversarial network gans gans painting type auction french art obvious mil christie auction xue art painting indistinguishable facial feature algorithm trained thousand painting portrait century original choice artwork gan western art xue paper chose focus chinese landscape painting meaningful western art visual turing test xue participant selection process participant art study person computer scale xue algorithm unique ability create artwork traditional gan method artwork unoriginal artwork xue input pre prepared sketch xue version framework sketch paint gan sapgan algorithm sketch landscape river detail xue groundwork future machine artwork original south china morning post,"[(1, 0.99242365)]",1
230581,Lifestyle,6,14/12/2020,AI solves big  biology mystery,The breakthrough could help scientists combat disease and manufacture better drugs.,"FOR decades scientists have been trying to figure out how to swiftly predict the twisting, tangled shape of proteins – and from there unravel a greater understanding of the machinery of life itself.
An Artificial Intelligence program created by firm DeepMind was shown to have virtually cracked the challenge, forecasting the way in which proteins contort into three dimensional structures in the results of a biannual competition that judges hailed as a game changer.
“In some sense the problem is solved,” said John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland who co-founded the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition in 1994, quoted by the journal Nature.
Janet Thornton of the European Bioinformatics Institute said in a statement from the competition organisers that the work to solve the problem was a “triumph of human curiosity, endeavour and intelligence”.
“A better understanding of protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and disease,” said Thornton, who is not affiliated with CASP or DeepMind.
The cells of all living beings contain thousands of proteins, workhorses that catalyse most chemical reactions in the body.
They are essential to life – from muscle function to carrying oxygen in the blood – and are also the key to diseases like cancer and even Covid-19.
A protein is a strand of amino acids, which then crumples into a unique three-dimensional tangle.
It is this shape that directly relates to its function.
Scientists have puzzled for half a century over how to accurately and quickly predict which formation – out of an unfathomably large number of possibilities – a protein might take by looking at its amino acid chain, a process that may take years in the laboratory.
The CASP contest involved around 100 teams who were given the amino acid sequences for dozens of proteins and tasked with estimating their final shapes – which were known to the organisers.
DeepMind – whose program AlphaGo stunned the world in 2016 by beating an elite human player in the complex strategy game Go – was already at the top of the field in the last contest in 2018.
This time the AlphaFold program determined the shape of many of the proteins “to a level of accuracy comparable to that achieved with expensive and time-consuming lab experiments”, according to the CASP organisers.
Medical marvel
Andrei Lupas, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology who was part of the assessment team, told Nature that AlphaFold had helped him determine the structure of a protein that his lab had been trying to pin down for a decade.
“This will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything,” he told Nature.
Derek Lowe, who writes about drug discovery and the pharma industry for Science Translational Medicine, described protein folding as like “watching piles of hinged lumber spontaneously restack themselves into functional boats, wagons and treehouses”.
He said the AlphaFold results did not mean the program would consistently come up with the right protein structure.
“But getting that level of structural accuracy on that many varied proteins is something that has just never been done before.”
DeepMind said it was looking at how the program might help increase knowledge of certain diseases, for example to identify whether a protein has malfunctioned.
“These insights could enable more precise work on drug development, complementing existing experimental methods to find promising treatments faster,” it said in a statement.
The firm added that it was working to produce a peer-
reviewed paper and was “exploring how best to provide broader access to the system”. – AFP",decade scientist shape unravel understanding machinery life artificial intelligence program firm deepmind cracked challenge forecasting protein dimensional structure biannual competition judge game changer sense john moult computational biologist university maryland critical assessment technique structure prediction casp competition journal nature janet thornton european bioinformatics institute statement competition organiser triumph human curiosity intelligence understanding protein ability computer life evolution human health disease thornton casp deepmind cell thousand workhorse catalyse chemical reaction essential life muscle function oxygen blood key disease cancer covid protein strand amino acid crumples unique dimensional tangle shape function scientist half century predict formation protein amino acid chain process laboratory casp contest team acid sequence dozen protein final shape organiser program alphago elite human player complex strategy game top field contest time alphafold program shape protein accuracy comparable expensive time lab experiment organiser medical marvel andrei lupas evolutionary biologist max institute developmental biology assessment team nature alphafold structure protein lab pin decade change medicine change change change nature derek lowe drug discovery pharma industry science translational medicine protein pile restack functional boat treehouses alphafold program structure level structural accuracy protein program increase knowledge protein insight enable precise drug development experimental method treatment statement firm peer paper provide broader access system afp,"[(3, 0.9952732)]",3

228307,StarBiz,11,08/12/2020,Cisco to buy Iodine for US$750mil to boost AI offerings,,"LOS ANGELES: Cisco Systems Inc said it will buy Iodine Plc for US$750mil to add artificial intelligence (AI) software used to help companies manage customer relationships.
The United States maker of networking gear will pay 595 pence (about US$8) a share for the United Kingdom provider of cloud communications software. The cash offer, which includes debt, is expected to close in the first quarter, Cisco said in a statement.
Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins is seeking to recast the company – whose hardware is the backbone of the internet – as a networking software and services provider. He’s responding to an industrywide shift that has seen more of the functions traditionally provided by in-house hardware migrate to outsourcing offered by remote data centres.
Cisco is seeking to push further into automation to improve the way its customers reach out to their end-users, enabling them to make their pitches and services more effective. 
And it wants to add those capabilities to its existing customer-relationship management offerings.
With Iodine, it sees an opportunity to use AI software to automate the outreach process more effectively than is currently possible. For example, it will help customers channel their offerings into the approach that they prefer, such as through text messages, social media or a voice call. 
Another instance is to provide a company representative with more contextual information about the customer they’re dealing with to make sure that they tailor that interaction in a way that the customer wants.
“A great customer relationship is built on consistently enjoyable interactions where every touchpoint on every channel is an opportunity for businesses to deliver rich, engaging and intuitive experiences,” Cisco senior vice-president Jeetu Patel said in the statement.

228487,Main,20,08/12/2020,Iran: Scientist killed by machine  gun with AI,,"TehEran: A satellite-controlled machine gun with “artificial intelligence” was used in last week’s assassination of a top nuclear scientist in Iran, the deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards said.
Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was driving on a highway outside Iran’s capital Teheran with a security detail of 
11 Guards on Nov 27, when the machine gun “zoomed in” on his face and fired 13 rounds, said rear-admiral Ali Fadavi.
The machine gun was mounted on a Nissan pickup and “focused only on martyr Fakhrizadeh’s face in a way that his wife, despite being only 25cm away, was not shot,” Mehr news agency quoted him as saying on Sunday.
It was being “controlled online” via satellite and used an “advanced camera and artificial intelligence” to make the target, he added.
Fadavi said Fakhrizadeh’s head 
of security took four bullets “as he threw himself” on the scientist and that there were “no terrorists at the scene”.
Iranian authorities have blamed arch foe Israel and the exiled opposition group the People’s Muja­hedeen of Iran for the assassination.

228031,StarBiz,8,07/12/2020,OFO Tech’s Geo-AI technology offers cost savings,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Utilising Malaysian-based geospatial-artificial intelligence (Geo-AI) technologies, infrastructure and plantation companies have experienced an average cost savings of up to 40% and a stronger topline growth. 
Geo-AI technology is created from an AI and geographic information system based on geographic data – which helps to visualise business objects on maps, improving efficiency and the decision-making abilities of businesses.  
OFO Tech Sdn Bhd managing director Armi Majid told StarBiz that the technology, which uses reality and real-time data, speeds up work and reduces manpower for companies. 
“Companies can even have cost savings of up to 70% after using our Geo-AI technology, as it reduces the time of work compared to using traditional manpower,” he said.
Lowering the cost of deploying the technology, Armi told StarBiz that the technology for business operations is “affordable” and is also offered to companies based on a yearly subscription model. 
“This technology is a saviour for organisations. 
“Our tech solution is affordable and businesses can choose to pay monthly or yearly rather than bearing the full cost of the technology. 
“Our clients have reformed their daily operations by using Geo-AI technology,” he added.
The #digitalXdata 2020 live virtual conference was organised by Star Media Group with OFO Tech as the Gigabyte Partner. 
Its business development director, Muhammad Amsyar Faiz, was a speaker at the Drone Track. 
Amsyar presented on “Drone Powered Solutions and Its Affiliated Technologies; Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Virtual & Augmented Reality, and Industrial IoT Technology – Emerging Trends and Applications.” 
The conference aims to help companies solve business challenges and uncover growth opportunities by redesigning a data-driven digital future.
During the movement control order, Armi noted that the Geo-AI technology was “tremendously” helpful to businesses as site operations were seen through the web platform, which did not require workers to visit the site. 
“Especially with the work from home environment, workers don’t have to go to the site, instead we brought the site to their homes via the Geo-AI technology,” he said. 
As such, Armi disclosed that the company’s sales rose 40% during the Covid-19 period compared to a year ago due to the acceleration of digitisation by infrastructure, construction and plantation companies, as well as additional incentives provided by government agencies to businesses. 
Currently, the company is focused on supplying its technology to three sectors, namely, construction, critical infrastructure as well as the plantation and agro-sectors. 
Post-Covid-19, Armi is confident that the company is set to quadruple its sales due to aggressive awareness promotions of technologies, additional upcoming new products and solutions and expansion to new markets.
The company plans to expand to new markets such as Indonesia, South Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
Meanwhile, Armi also commended Malaysia Digital Economy Corp’s support to local tech solution providers, as it enables Malaysian-made tech to stand tall among other developed countries. 
“Given the support from agencies, the government can do more to lead the adoption of locally developed Geo-AI platforms amongst various agencies.

228071,Lifestyle,5,07/12/2020,China tops world in AI patent filings,,"CHINA now leads the world in artificial intelligence patent applications, surpassing the United States for the first time, a development seen bolstering the country’s position as the second-largest market for AI amid Beijing’s tech and trade war with Washington.
The achievement was highlighted by Li Yuxiao, deputy head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies, at a press conference during the 7th World Internet Conference (WIC).
China filed more than 110,000 AI patent applications last year to move ahead of the US in the number of such filings worldwide, according to Li, whose agency is affiliated with industry regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China.
“China is strengthening its independence and technological capabilities in Internet information technology,” said Li, who did not specify the number of AI patents filed by the US in 2019.
The US and China are jostling to dominate advanced technologies, from 5G to quantum computing and AI. 
The sharp rise in China’s AI patent applications, funding and commercial deployment in surveillance activities prompted the US government to take action in October last year, when a number of the country’s AI tech champions were added to Washington’s trade blacklist. 
That has restricted their access to American hi-tech components like semiconductors and software.
China, which has laid out plans to become the global AI leader by 2030, is also being challenged by the technology’s unclear application scenarios, high investment, and security and ethical issues.
Both China and the US see the potential of AI technology in helping improve the efficiency of their respective economies, including in industries such as manufacturing, transport and logistics, health care and education.
Last year, surveillance was the biggest single end user of AI in China, accounting for 53.8% of all AI-powered applications, according to research firm iiMedia. Finance was second at 15.8%, followed by marketing at 11.6% and transport at 4.2%.
At WIC, two separate studies – the China Internet Development Report 2020 and World Internet Development Report 2020 – were released to show the country’s efforts in developing its digital economy, which includes relevant infrastructure like datacentres and 5G mobile networks to support growth amid the coronavirus pandemic.
“Over the past year, China has continued to show the world its responsibility and contribution to the development of the Internet,” said Li.
The conference is also known as the Wuzhen Summit, after the northern town in Zhejiang province where it takes place.
China’s digital economy in 2019, according to the country report, had a total value of more than 35.8 trillion yuan (RM22.13 trillion), representing 36.2% of the country’s gross domestic product that year. – South China Morning Post",china artificial intelligence patent application united time development country position largest market tech trade war achievement yuxiao deputy head chinese academy cyberspace study conference internet conference wic china patent application filing agency industry regulator cyberspace administration china independence technological capability technology patent china dominate technology sharp rise china patent application commercial deployment surveillance activity government action country tech champion trade blacklist access american tech component semiconductor software china plan global leader technology unclear application scenario investment security ethical issue potential technology efficiency respective economy industry transport logistics health care education surveillance biggest single user china accounting application firm iimedia finance marketing transport wic separate study internet development report internet development report country effort digital economy relevant infrastructure datacentres network growth coronavirus pandemic china responsibility contribution development internet conference wuzhen summit northern town zhejiang province china digital economy country report total yuan country gross domestic product south china morning post,"[(0, 0.99376273)]",0

227455,StarBiz 7,6,05/12/2020,A smarter business with Hybrid Cloud and AI,"Better, scalable and secure digital services in store","THE ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted businesses of all sizes and companies across industries are required to transform how they operate to thrive in this new climate. 
According to IBM’s Institute of Business Value study “Covid-19 and the Future of Business”, 55% of C-suite executives say that the pandemic has resulted in permanent changes to organisational strategy and 60% of the responding organisations have accelerated their digital transformations due to Covid-19.  
Businesses have recognised that they must be built for continuity and resilience. 
The “next normal” environment has required the prioritisation and acceleration of digital transformation across products, services and business processes to meet the new digital demands from both employees and customers.
“Globally, companies have accelerated their digital transformation. 
“They do this by adopting artificial intelligence (AI), cloud-based remote collaboration tools and seeking data-driven insights to fast-tracking innovation and transforming business operations.
“Cloud and AI technology can help businesses to deliver better, scalable and secure digital services, enhance customer experience, and to become truly cognitive enterprises.
“We see an acceleration in the adoption of hybrid cloud as a result of the pandemic as companies turn to application modernisation, process automation and AI infusion of its business operations. 
“A hybrid cloud platform approach delivers 2.5 times more value than a traditional, public cloud only approach,” says IBM Malaysia managing director Catherine Lian.
In terms of customer experience, a recent call centre research revealed that 25% of respondents would pay more for a better experience regardless of product type while 62% would switch to a competitor product if they had a bad experience. 
The research also noted that 64% wanted real-time responses at any point in time.
Businesses can take full benefit of cloud and AI to enhance their customer experience and provide a real-time response. 
“IBM has made significant strides forward and partnered with innovative companies across industries to infuse cloud and AI in their contact centre and customer care centres. 
“This allows organisations to drastically reduce costs with the use of intelligent chatbots and virtual agents, for example. 
“Companies will be able to redeploy their resources or enhance their offerings to generate new revenue streams, with the shift of focus to sales from service,” says Devabalan Theyventheran, partner for Asean Financial Services Sector at IBM Global Business Services.
Devabalan was speaking at the #digitalXdata 2020 CxO Virtual Dialogue: Emerge as a Stronger Brand in the Next Normal. 
The roundtable session saw professionals from various industries sharing their challenges and lessons from the current crisis. 
When the pandemic first hit, IBM was also helping government agencies, healthcare organisations and academic institutions throughout the world use AI to put trusted data and information into the hands of the citizens. 
In Asean, IBM collaborated with United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network Youth Philippines to deliver fast and trusted Covid-19 information using IBM Watson Assistant, a conversational AI solution/virtual agent designed and trained to understand natural language and interact with users to provide responses to Covid-19 questions.
IBM Malaysia Global Technology Services general manager Joey Mak also notes that AI has become an important tool in helping organisations draw insights from data and in implementing data-driven solutions while ensuring that the data is protected. 
“As data becomes the top asset for businesses, data governance will ensure that data and information being handled is consistent, reliable and trustworthy.
“Establishing and deploying an analytics platform that embeds data governance and data integration, among other solutions, has never been more critical,” says Mak. 
Participants at the roundtable noted that companies that had gone digital early in the pandemic have performed well despite the challenging economic condition.
They also acknowledged that there was a need for a change in mindset to embrace emerging technology to stay competitive in the next normal.
“With the right technology solutions and best practices, businesses can ensure continuity of their business operations and engage their customers in new and innovative ways. 
“With automation, we are empowering next-generation of chief information officers and their teams to prioritise the crucial work of today’s digital enterprises – managing and mining data to apply predictive insights that help lead to more impactful business results and lower cost,” says Praveen Hariharan, IBM Global Business Services, Country Leader, IBM Malaysia.

225837,Lifestyle,2,01/12/2020,AI helps budding poets with stanzas,,"HAVING a hard time with your rhymes? Fear not, artificial intelligence (AI) is on hand to help with writers’ block. 
Google recently launched a new tool called “Verse by Verse” to help budding poets create verses worthy of Emily Dickinson or Edgar Allan Poe.
The strict meters of formal verse can be enough to have any aspiring poet doubting their vocation. 
Now, Google is offering budding bards a helping hand with Verse by Verse, billed as an “AI-powered muse that helps you compose poetry inspired by classic American poets”. 
As a starting point, the tech giant is offering wannabe wordsmiths and poets a choice of three big names from American poetry – including Emma Lazarus, James Weldon Johnson and Lydia Huntley Sigourney. 
The artificial intelligence behind the tool then draws on 
the poets’ styles for inspiration when creating new verses. Users simply have to state their preferences as to the poetic form, syllable count and rhyme. Whether classic quatrains or couplets, or free verse full of blistering rhymes – you decide. 
Once the parameters are set, the AI works its magic. After penning a first verse, the AI will offer several proposed continuations of the poem.

222147,Lifestyle,20,22/11/2020,Needs more AI animus,"New tech thriller Next is a little slow to take shape, leaving us guessing  as to the goals of its ‘villain’.","ARE artificially intelligent virtual assistant speakers – like Amazon’s Alexa, dig? – getting a bad reputation in TV-land? 
Last year on the excellent Evil, we had a couple of different instances where the little devices turned malevolent.
And now, on Next – the new 10-episode “event series” from 24 producer Manny Coto – we’ve seen an “Iliza” virtual assistant try to coax a bullied little boy into taking violent revenge on his tormentors.
I don’t know about you, but this stuff is enough to make me regard even my (aesthetically similar) electric mosquito trap with suspicion.
On Next, the “evil” force is not Evil as such, but a highly sophisticated, human-level artificial intelligence.
It is so sophisticated that even its creator, eccentric genius Paul LeBlanc (John Slattery, Mad Men and older Howard Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), pulled the plug on the project.
Why? Paul feared that its creation would lead to a technological singularity, that point at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and explosive, leading to upheavals in human civilisation.
But there’s no keeping a good sinister AI down and so, thanks to human greed in the form of Paul’s brother Ted (Jason Butler Harner), the project known as Next flourished, evolved, and then … went rogue.
Essentially, Next is the story of how Paul, FBI Special Agent Shea Salazar (Fernanda Andrade) and her team of cybercrime specialists try to track and neutralise the AI before it can do untold harm.
So clearly, Next is plonking its plot points down on the side of the debate which posits that any superintelligence worth its salt will inevitably destroy humanity.
It’s a concept way older than even Skynet (as a search for AI-themed films will reveal), but at least Coto and Co have taken the savvy route of not trying to depict Next on screen.
Heck, running lights on circuit boards, blinking status panels and creepy mag tape reel rotation are all so last century.
So on Next, it’s the stuff urban dwellers have come to regard as commonplace today that serves as the visual (and sometimes verbal) representation of its antagonist’s malice.
From those much-maligned virtual assistant speakers to our ever-dependable smartphones, from smart to not-so-smart vehicles, anything which is connected to the Internet is open to being taken over by Next – humanity’s vulnerability here is laid on thick and fast, like a constant validation of every technophobe’s paranoia.
Being early days yet for the show (this review is based on only the first three episodes), Next has not really established its personality or objectives yet.
In the meantime, viewers are left to watch Paul, Shea and their AI-busters reason out what their quarry is trying to achieve.
That would be fine by itself, but we are also made to cope with everything that is heaped on Paul’s shoulders. 
As (more or less) the central figure here, Slattery carries the weight of his character’s mission well enough – when he isn’t being worn down by some unnecessary woes the writers have piled 
on him in the name of “characterisation”. 
For one thing, this tech genius basically got kicked out of his advanced technology company for refusing to work on … advanced technology. 
Ooh, it’s almost like the time Tony Stark wanted his weapons company to stop making weapons. No wonder Slattery sometimes seems to be channelling his fast-talking MCU son.
Also: he’s estranged not only from his brother but also his own daughter. 
And, oh yes, Paul happens to be dying from a degenerative brain disease.
Someone really, really wanted us to feel bad for this guy; as if being the progenitor of an entity that could wipe out humanity was not enough of a burden. 
The end result, unfortunately, is a diffused character that does not quite anchor the show.
It’s a lot easier to get behind Shea’s struggles, not only with her job but her family as well; Next goes after both to derail her investigation into its machinations, you see. 
Next is much more watchable when it focuses on those aspects, and on the terrifying possibility that one’s entire existence can be hijacked by an unseen force (like one truly unfortunate soul in the third episode).
I’m not totally sold on the show but I will keep watching if only to see what Next is really getting up to. Personally, I figure a superintelligence worthy of the monicker will not extinguish humanity, but enslave and bend us to its will instead. 
That would put a totally different slant on the term “human resource”, with the new overlord certainly being smart enough – smarter than a good number of people – to recognise and fully exploit the worth of humanity (even if we’re just meant to be its batteries, at least we’ll still be plugged in to something).

214297,StarEdu,3,01/11/2020,AI and data to enhance curriculum,,"THE Education Ministry is training students to have skills relevant to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0).
This is being done via this the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) “Informatics and Data Science Education Reform for Digital, Inclusive and Sustainable Society” project, said the ministry’s Curriculum Development Division deputy director (technology) Sofian Azmi Tajul Arus.
The project, which has already begun, aims to develop primary and secondary school curriculum based on artificial intelligence (AI) and data.
In line with this project, the division believes that IR4.0 thinking skills – namely computational thinking, coding, data science, machine learning and statistical thinking – should be mastered by students.
“Computational thinking is the process of thinking logically and systematically in problem solving while using the basic principles of computer science through programming and algorithmic skills.
“It involves techniques such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and generalisation,” said Sofian Azmi.
Decomposition, he explained, involves breaking up complex problems into smaller, more controlled and easily understood parts of the issue to be analysed and resolved; while pattern recognition involves analysing and observing the issue based on trends, and information.
“Abstraction involves summarising common features and determining important aspects of a problem and generalisation is the process of determining the similarities in a problem to produce a formula, algorithm or model,” he added.
Stressing that the ministry is committed to preparing students for the future, he said it has launched the National Policy on Industry 4.0 and has adopted equitable and inclusive use of AI in education to support Unesco’s sustainable development goals (SDG).
This, he said, includes integrating AI skills in the school curriculum.
“The National Education Committee suggested that the ministry include an AI module into the curriculum.
“We value input from relevant parties as it enables us to enhance the curriculum to make it more relevant to the times,” he said, adding that the ministry had through a revised Primary School Standard-based Curriculum (KSSR) and Secondary School Standard-based Curriculum (KSSM), rolled out IR4.0 related education including robotics and coding, basic computer science, computer science and innovation.
“However, we (ministry) are still facing challenges. There is a lot of upskilling among teachers that needs to be done.
“There is also a lack of infrastructure, facilities and gadgets,” he said during a YouTube interview on Oct 19.

212459,Main,12,26/10/2020,Use of AI in healthcare can solve the inequality of access,,"MY 85-year-old uncle was hospitalised due to ageing issues at a private hospital in Kolkata, India. In the intensive care unit, he contracted Covid-19 from another patient whose infection the hospital was not even aware of. It took the hospital days to figure out that many of its ICU patients, doctors and other professionals were already infected.
The pandemic shows us the inequality of healthcare access. This collective global experience will invariably lead to demands of massive upscaling of healthcare. Economic and political inaction under such demand is not an option.
So far, experts have hesitated to implement the broad introduction of healthcare AI (artificial intelligence). However, if the choice is between AI and no diagnosis at all, choosing the former can give the deprived a fairer chance.
The explosion of digitised medical data demands a fundamental change in mindset of how technology should be used in clinical workflow. Training already available healthcare workers in rural areas how to use a new smartphone app is much easier. We already witnessed such a technology transition when photography moved from physical film to digital. Platforms such as Flickr and programmes like Photoshop have changed the entire landscape of how photos are processed, handled and consumed globally.
While measuring the economic impact of healthcare AI, it is not enough to just think in terms of how much AI saves for a particular diagnosis compared with the currently available method. This approach only measures profit. The alternative here is massive, long-term investment in traditional healthcare during a global economic slowdown. The explosion of digitised medical data cannot be matched by increasing the number of high-quality healthcare professionals.
The cost of diagnostic delay during a pandemic is substantial at sociopolitical and economic levels. A global acceleration towards AI-ready healthcare is of paramount importance.
There are, of course, legitimate concerns about data security, privacy and unprecedented surveillance. Nobody is suggesting this will be easy. But shouldering this responsibility is the price we pay for living in democracies.
When it comes to something as basic a need as access to primary healthcare, it is not an option for the haves to decide detrimentally for the have-nots.

210627,StarBiz,3,22/10/2020,Giant hyperscale  data centre in AI park,G3 Global to take the lead in the project,"PETALING JAYA: G3 Global Bhd plans to house the country’s largest hyperscale data centre in the proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) park in Bukit Jalil, starting with three 10MW hyperscale data centres in the first phase of development.
At maturity, the data centres will have a potential end state of 100MW. 
G3 Global executive director Dr James Tee said G3 Global has the opportunity to take a leading role in the hyperscale data centre space through the group’s association with Green Packet Bhd, It will support the initial demand by Tencent Cloud’s operations in Malaysia as part of its global node, as well as meet demand from other large scale anchor cloud operators.
In August, Green Packet inked a 10-year agreement with Tencent Cloud to provide cloud computing solutions in Malaysia.
“The hyperscale data centre will be scaled according to demand progressively.
“G3 Global is in discussions with domestic and regional hyperscale data centre partners on potential collaborations.
“We are also open to collaborating with strategic partners who bring demand from their extensive network and user base,” he told StarBiz.A hyperscale data centre caters to between one and three clients who require higher technology specifications and greater data capacity for their operations.
In comparison, a standard data centre serves some 50 to 100 enterprises.
At present, Singapore is the data centre hub for the South-East Asian region, providing 64% of total supply with a capacity of 410MW in 2019.
Tee noted that Singapore’s data centre capacity is expected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6% to 542MW in 2024, according to research firm Analysys Mason.
However, further supply will be hampered by shortage of land and power, as well as cost concerns.
“Hence, Malaysia is well positioned to capture the spillover demand from Singapore, given the close proximity, greater availability of land and power, as well as low connectivity cost.
“This is potentially similar to Langfang and Zhangjiakou, which are key data centre hubs in Greater Beijing, due to land scarcity and power constraints in Beijing itself,” he said.
On the domestic front, demand for digital services is expected to be driven by a strong government push for digitalisation and cloud adoption, as well as a shift towards greater digital consumption by enterprises and consumers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Bank Negara’s new policy on risk management in technology would drive demand for outsourced data centre co-location and cloud services for financial institutions, as on-premise servers will not meet the new requirements, Tee said.
According to MDEC, co-location data centre capacity is expected to grow by 12% CAGR from 59MW to 104MW between 2019 and 2024.
At present, cloud and Internet giants lease more than 70% of their hyperscale data centre footprint from commercial data centre operators.
“Some of the very powerful value drivers that companies should look to exploit from hyperscale cloud platforms are cost, scalability and interoperability. The hyperscale platforms provide the ability to handle immense volumes of activity and data, quickly and seamlessly.
“In addition, the hyperscale provider’s cloud platform allows customers to extend and build out their capabilities, as well as offers integration with other systems at a lower cost,” said Tee.
The hyperscale data centres will also support the deployment of autonomous cars, which generate between 380 Terabyte (TB) to 5100TB of sensor data per car annually.
The AI park, which will house AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote AI technology in Malaysia, will also feature autonomous cars, among other AI technology such as licence plate and facial recognition.
According to a Bursa Malaysia filing on Oct 9, G3 Global received a letter of intent from Technology Park Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd for the building of the AI park at Technology Park Malaysia.

210783,Main,21,22/10/2020,AI model detects Covid-19 and other diseases,,"BEIJING: Chinese researchers published a paper in the journal Nature Communications this month proposing an artificial intelligence model that can help doctors quickly differentiate between Covid-19, influenza and pneumonia with high accuracy.
Since the Covid-19 outbreak, numerous AI systems have been developed and used for front-line detection and diagnosis, such as analysing chest X-rays and CT scans. 
However, with flu season approaching, if Covid-19 and influenza were to break out together, causing the CT diagnosis workload to skyrocket, differentiating between the two respiratory illnesses would prove challenging for doctors.
A new AI model may provide the answer. Researchers from Tsinghua University and Union Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, have developed and evaluated an AI system using a large data set with more than 11,000 CT volumes from cases of Covid-19, influenza, non-viral community-acquired pneumonia, and non-pneumonia.
The AI model, known as a deep convolutional neural network-based system, turned detection experiences accumulated by experts into algorithms. Test results showed it can differentiate between four respiratory diseases, including Covid-19, influenza and non-pneumonia, with a high degree of accuracy.
The AI model will help lessen the workload of doctors. The study showed that the average reading time for radiologists was six and a half minutes, while that of the AI system was 2.73 seconds.
The paper said the AI system was only slightly worse at distinguishing pneumonia from nonpneumonia than radiologists. – Xinhua",chinese researcher paper journal nature communication month artificial intelligence model doctor covid influenza pneumonia accuracy covid numerous system front detection diagnosis chest ray scan season covid influenza break diagnosis workload skyrocket respiratory illness doctor model provide answer researcher university union hospital hubei province system data volume influenza viral community pneumonia pneumonia model deep convolutional neural network system detection experience expert algorithm test differentiate respiratory disease covid influenza pneumonia degree accuracy model lessen workload doctor average reading time half minute system paper system pneumonia nonpneumonia radiologist,"[(3, 0.9892139)]",3

208721,StarBiz 7,3,17/10/2020,AI park will help Malaysia take the lead in digital future,,"MALAYSIA’s development of an artificial intelligence (AI) park will be vital to cement its position as the leading South-East Asian nation in the field of AI as the country takes a step forward.
AI technology is expected to contribute some US$115bil (RM476.84bil) to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2030, according to a report by consultancy firm Kearney.
Neighbouring countries such as Indonesia are expected to see an inflow of US$366bil (RM1.52 trillion) while Thailand and Singapore could see AI bringing in US$117bil (RM485.43bil) and US$110bil (RM456.39bil) to their respective GDPs.
Financial services and retail have been early adopters of AI in Indonesia. 
On a whole, there is a lot of potential in the logistics and supply chain sector.  AI usage in South-East Asia is mainly for marketing and sales, followed by supply chain and manufacturing.
“The world today revolves around a rapid pace of technology convergence that enables efficiency, elimination of wastage and gains in productivity.
“AI has indeed delivered new ways of working and for AI players like us, both from the technology and smart city fields, to really build sustainable cities and assist in maintaining infrastructure and in improving public services.
“It all starts with the ability to gather data from trillions of sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices and extract actionable insights,” Dr James Tee tells StarBizWeek. He is the new executive director of G3 Global Bhd, an associate company of Green Packet Bhd. 
Key among G3’s initiatives would be the realisation of an AI park to position Malaysia as the AI and digital hub for Asean.
The company inked an agreement last year with Chinese partners SenseTime Group Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Co Ltd (CHEC) on the setting up of Malaysia’s first AI park, with a total investment of more than US$1bil (RM4.15bil) over the next five years.
Tee is of the view that the AI park will place Malaysian on the forefront of AI research and commercialisation of innovation, which will stimulate a new generation of high-tech businesses and jobs in Malaysia.
He adds that the beauty of Malaysia’s AI park is that it is a private sector-driven investment and not with the public sector at the forefront. It is also of utmost importance now because the public sector is not in a very good position to be able to spend and pump prime the economy.
“G3, together with our technological partners from abroad, are going to bring in investments from domestic and foreign sources. 
“If you look at the demand side of the economy, where is that growth going to come from?
“Private consumption, which is around 60% of our GDP, is going to grow at a tepid pace because people are uncertain and they don’t spend as much,” he says, adding that exports are needed to lead the charge.
In order for exports to continue growing, Tee says, investments need to come in at the upstream and the AI park is one of the projects that will drive this upstream investment.
All they hope for is that government facilitates in terms of providing relevant incentives to attract global companies to the AI park and bring in foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.
With Budget 2021 due next month and the 12th Malaysia Plan early next year, Tee hopes the government prioritises policies that will encourage private investments and FDIs into the technology sector. 
“In association with Green Packet, what we’re bringing into the picture are fintech (financial technology) and proptech (property technology) solutions to create a truly touchless economy and touchless operation to fully transform us into an intelligent city.
“Our vision is for the AI Park to be Malaysia’s very first AI-powered Technopolis, with schools, residences, factories, and transportation and infrastructure facilities equipped with the latest AI solutions.
“This will be important for the nation as it will house the necessary AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote the technology within our country,” says Tee, adding that a data centre will be one of the key components in the AI park, which will facilitate cloud computing and the digitisation of enterprises.
He also points out that South Asia lags two to three years behind the US and China in terms of AI adoption, according to Kearney and Singapore-based investment firm EDBI.
A survey conducted has shown that the AI adoption rate stands at 14% across South-East Asia, an improvement from 8% last year.
Malaysia’s AI adoption rate of 8.1% also lags significantly behind Indonesia at 24.6% and Thailand at 17.1%.
One of the main issues is that many Malaysian organisations are concerned over the cost of solutions and doubt the quality of the model.
Despite that, Tee believes opportunities are abundant to harness the potential of AI technology to improve productivity and generate revenue.  He stresses that Malaysia has to do more in terms of educating enterprises.
“Manufacturing, especially electrical and electronics (E&E) manufacturing, will be an important part of the Malaysian growth as other sectors on the supply side will not be able to support the country’s economic growth in the years to come.
“This is where AI comes in, because it is plugged into the supply chain of the E&E sector. And it is not just the semiconductor that will benefit. Those in integrated circuit design, those who do tests, measurements and packaging are all going to fit in that growth.

In the Malaysian manufacturing sector, 38% of the contribution came from the E&E sector, the bulk or 23% of which from semiconductors. 
So when Malaysia’s first AI park project kicks off, there will be a tremendous growth in the semiconductor industry with its deployment and usage for AI technology.
“Semiconductor is basically the brain of AI technology. 
“The AI park is a very important project that can bring Malaysia to the next level and it will certainly be a national agenda for the government to create a high-tech industry and create high value jobs for the country,” James Tee told StarBiz. 
Tee was recently appointed as an executive director of G3 Global Bhd, an associate company of Green Packet Bhd. 
Among G3’s strategic initiatives would be the realisation of an AI park to position Malaysia as the AI and digital hub for Asean. 
Tee was certain that AI would be in the mainstream in the years to come and when that happens, coupled with the convergence of technology including blockchain, big data and other technology, it will boost the semiconductor industry growth and ultimately, drive growth in the E&E sector. 
“Malaysia is in a very strong position because we are traditionally very strong in semiconductor and manufacturing so we want to ride on the existing strength of Malaysia to continue to lead South-East Asia in terms of AI technology and its deployment. 
“We believe this is a very important step for Malaysia to step out and step up for us to take a leap through our AI park and AI city development,” Tee said. 
With the constant adaptation and adoption of the most advanced technology in the city development, Tee said much focus would be placed on research and development, commercialisation and innovation of new technology that can help to serve the people better, increase productivity and the growth of the country. 
He added that they were quite clear that E&E manufacturing would be a very important part of the Malaysian growth moving forward because sectors on the supply side would not be able to support the country’s growth in the years to come.

206339,StarBiz 7,3,10/10/2020,AI park and Perak e-wallet boost for Green Packet,Firm set to register an earnings turnaround by FY21,"AFTER a recent lull in headline-grabbing news, Green Packet Bhd seems to be making its way into the news again. 
Yesterday, its associate company G3 Global Bhd said in a Bursa Malaysia filing that it had received a letter of intent (LoI) from Technology Park Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd (TPM) regarding the building of the ambitious artificial intelligence (AI) park located at Technology Park Malaysia in Bukit Jalil. 
On the same day, Green Packet also announced that it has made some inroads into powering the use of digital payments in the state of Perak as part of a deal with the state government. 
This comes after CGS-CIMB had on Tuesday issued a non-rated research report on Green Packet, highlighting in particular, the earnings potential that the technology company could gain from its venture with Tencent Cloud to build the cloud business for the Malaysian market. 
G3 has already teamed up with China’s top AI firm, SenseTime, along with China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd to jointly develop the AI park.
In addition, G3 continues to be in talks with big-name technology providers to be anchor investors in the AI park.
Further details on the development have yet to be ironed out, but it was previously reported that the AI park is expected to have a gross development value of “above tens of billions.”
The AI park is envisioned to be Malaysia’s very first AI-powered technopolis, with schools, residences, factories, and transportation and infrastructure facilities equipped with the latest AI solutions.
It also has been reported that the AI park is vital as it would house the necessary AI research-related public service infrastructure as a base to promote AI technology in Malaysia. 
The AI park would also be a place for talent to be trained on AI and machine learning and will serve as a platform for the development of AI solutions such as speech recognition, robotics and smart city technology. It is also planned to be a regional epicentre for data management and commercial ecosystem.
 In the LoI, TPM expressed its intent to further discuss G3’s request for proposal submissions and the proposed development project of the AI park.
While the LoI indicates some progress on the development project, there needs to be a letter of award to follow, which will then provide more clarity on the terms of the deal. 
 Meanwhile, Green Packet’s wholly owned subsidiary kiplePay is collaborating with Digital Perak Corp Holdings to provide a unified payment platform for cashless transactions in government services and businesses in Perak.
With this cashless payment platform, citizens can pay for services through the Digital Perak web portal, which include training courses, co-working space, computer labs and office through Hub Innovasi and Multimedia (HiM), as well as asset booking, quit rent and summon payment with municipal councils in Perak.
Apart from that, merchants under Digital Perak’s S.M.A.R.T Niaga @ Perak programme will be able to use kiplePay’s merchant app that supports cashless payments for in-store transactions, while the kipleBiz Unified Payment platform will support merchants who sell their services or goods online with payment gateway services that facilitates multiple payment modes such as online banking, debit or credit card and multiple ewallets.
According to CGS-CIMB, kiplePay is pursuing further opportunities in the education sector, on the back of its position as the leading e-wallet in the local public higher education sector.
As of August 2020, kiplePay commanded a 60% share of an estimated market size of RM5.8bil in potential spending per annum.
The research house notes that kiplePay is exploring opportunities with Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd and the National Higher Education Fund Corp (PTPTN).
Despite Green Packet’s digital services segment posting a net loss of RM13mil for the first half of the financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) due to business development costs, kiplePay’s gross transaction during the period grew 113% year-on-year.
With kiplePay’s prospects in the pipeline, coupled with Green Packet’s 10-year exclusive agreement signed with Tencent Cloud and the winding up of loss-making Singapore mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Vivohub, CGS-CIMB notes that these are signs of green shoots for Green Packet.
The Tencent Cloud agreement will see Green Packet initially invest RM100mil for 600 servers that will go live by the first quarter of 2021.
“Green Packet believes this will grow to 3,000 to 4,000 servers over the next four to five years with a total investment of RM300mil to RM500mil. 
“Green Packet projects the business to contribute 30% to 40% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) in FY22, with a net present value (NPV) of US$82mil (RM339mil) over 10 years.
“Green Packet posted a core net loss of RM65mil and RM37mil in FY19 and the first half of FY20 due to continued investments to expand its digital service business,” says CGS-CIMB, adding that Green Packet is optimistic of an earnings turnaround by FY21.
The earnings turnaround is also partly due to the winding up of Vivohub and full settlement of exchangeable medium-term notes (EMTNs) issued to TM previously.
Excluding Vivohub’s earnings, CGS-CIMB says Green Packet’s communications business segment would have turned in a net profit of RM2mil in FY19 and RM3mil in the first half of FY20.
As for the full settlement of EMTNs, it is estimated that Green Packet will save some RM20mil in interest cost per annum, turning its net debt of RM252mil during the second quarter of FY20 into proforma net cash of RM31mil.
Just last month, Green Packet divested its 10.3% fully-diluted stake in webe to TM for full settlement of RM283mil in EMTNs. 
Despite all the positive news flows surrounding Green Packet, its share price has been flat of late.
Following the spike it enjoyed in May 2020 at a high of RM1.44, Green Packet’s share price has since declined, ending Friday at 50 sen, with a market capitalisation of RM549mil. 
However, it should be noted that Green Packet owns just under 30% of G3 and more than 50% of the latter’s outstanding warrants, the total value of which comes up to some RM730mil.
It should be noted that Green Packet is in the midst of a placement exercise. The group plans to raise another RM63mil to RM99mil via a second tranche of private placement of 120 million to 190 million shares at a 52 sen apiece to fund working capital and cloud infrastructure investment.",lull headline news green packet bhd news yesterday company global bhd bursa malaysia received letter intent loi technology park malaysia corp sdn bhd tpm ambitious artificial intelligence park technology park malaysia bukit jalil day green packet inroad digital payment perak deal government cgs cimb tuesday report green packet earnings potential technology company venture tencent cloud build cloud business malaysian market china top firm china harbour engineering company park addition talk technology provider investor park detail development park gross development ten billion park malaysia technopolis school factory transportation infrastructure facility solution park vital house public service infrastructure base promote technology malaysia park talent machine platform development solution recognition robotics smart city technology regional epicentre data management commercial ecosystem loi tpm intent request proposal submission development project park loi progress development project letter follow clarity term green packet subsidiary kiplepay digital perak corp holding unified payment platform cashless transaction government service business cashless payment platform pay service digital perak web portal training course space computer lab office hub multimedia asset quit rent summon payment municipal council perak merchant digital perak niaga perak programme kiplepay merchant app cashless payment transaction unified payment platform support merchant service online payment gateway service multiple payment mode debit credit card multiple ewallets cimb kiplepay opportunity education sector position wallet local public education sector august kiplepay share market size potential spending annum house note opportunity bank islam malaysia national education fund corp ptptn green packet digital service segment net loss mil half financial dec business development cost gross transaction period kiplepay prospect pipeline green packet exclusive agreement tencent cloud loss singapore mobile virtual network operator mvno vivohub cgs cimb note sign green shoot green packet tencent cloud agreement green packet invest mil server quarter green packet grow server total investment mil mil green packet project business earnings tax depreciation amortisation net npv mil mil green packet core net loss mil mil half investment digital service business cgs cimb green packet optimistic earnings turnaround earnings turnaround vivohub settlement exchangeable medium term note vivohub earnings cgs cimb green packet communication business segment net profit mil mil half settlement emtns green packet mil cost annum net debt mil quarter proforma net cash mil month green packet diluted stake webe settlement mil positive news green packet share price flat late spike green packet share price friday sen market capitalisation mil green packet outstanding warrant total mil green packet midst placement exercise plan mil mil tranche private placement share fund capital cloud infrastructure investment,"[(3, 0.6093189), (5, 0.30901638), (11, 0.079592064)]",3
203617,Lifestyle,6,05/10/2020,Can AI encourage good behaviour online?,,"HOSTILE and hateful remarks are thick on the ground on social networks in spite of persistent efforts by Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube to tone them down. 
Now researchers at the OpenWeb platform have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to moderate Internet users’ comments before they are even posted. 
The method appears to be effective because one third of users modified the text of their comments when they received a nudge from the new system, which warned that what they had written might be perceived as offensive.
The study conducted by OpenWeb and Perspective API analysed 400,000 comments that some 50,000 users were preparing to post on sites like AOL, Salon, Newsweek, RT and Sky Sports.
Some of these users received a feedback message or nudge from a machine learning algorithm to the effect that the text they were preparing to post might be insulting, or against the rules of the forum they were using. 
Instead of rejecting comments it found to be suspect, the moderation algorithm then invited their authors to reformulate what they had written.
“Let’s keep the conversation civil. Please remove any inappropriate language from your comment,” was a message prompt or “Some members of the community may find your comment offensive. Try again?”
In response to this kind of feedback, a third of Internet users (34%) immediately modified their comments, while 36% went ahead and posted their comments anyway, taking the risk that they might be rejected by the moderating algorithm. 
Even more surprisingly, some users made modifications that did not necessarily make their comments kinder or less hostile.
While close to 30% of users opted to accept the feedback message and delete potentially offensive text from their comments, more than a quarter (25.8%) attempted to dupe the moderating algorithm.
Deliberate spelling errors and adding spaces between letters were just two of the tricks they used to modify the form of their comments while leaving their content unchanged.
The 400,000 comments analysed in the study are, however, a mere drop in the ocean when compared to the millions that are posted daily on the Internet, some of which carry offensive and insulting language. 
Faced with this situation, tech giants are boosting their efforts to combat online hate more effectively.

190435,Lifestyle,4,07/09/2020,AI aces aerial combat,"In the dogfights of the future, is artificial intelligence the new top gun?","WHEN the final dogfight was over, there was no argument who won.
The competition pitted a newcomer against one of the US Air Force’s top pilots in a simulated battle for air superiority in the AlphaDogfight Trials in the United States.
After making it through the three rounds of qualifiers, the contender took on and convincingly rounded the veteran.
But there was no slap on the back for the victor – the winner was an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm.
In a 5-0 sweep, the AI “pilot” created by the Maryland-based defence contractor Heron Systems beat “Banger”, a National Guard pilot and recent Air Force Weapons School Instructor Course graduate with over 2,000 hours of experience flying F-16s, according to Air Force Magazine.
But does this make AI a better pilot? Not so fast, say military analysts.
The AlphaDogfight Trials are designed to “demonstrate the feasibility of developing effective, intelligent autonomous agents capable of defeating adversary aircraft in a dogfight”, according to a key sponsor, the Advanced Research Project Agency (Darpa).
Darpa is an agency of the US Department of Defence responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.
The competition included multiple contractors and pitted their AI contenders against each other in a Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons simulation for the right to compete against Banger, according to various reports.
Despite the human pilots losing, military analysts in the US and China said the result did not mean that AI could defeat or even replace a human in real-life combat.
Hong Kong-based military commentator Song Zhongping said AI technology had been used in many countries for virtual reality (VR) training, but such technology was still unable to deal with unpredictable battle scenarios.
“Existing AI technology is still far away from real combat applications because its reaction is merely based on using big data technology and Cloud computing to simulate scenarios through algorithm optimisation,” Song, now a commentator on Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television, said.
“For example, would the AI pilot still win if it was not an F-16 but a stealth fighter jet like the F-22 or F-35 taking part in the AlphaDogfight Trials contest? I don’t think so.”
Song said many experiments had proven that AI failed to make unique observe-orient-decide-act (OODA) decisions, an important step in dogfight strategy that was developed by John Boyd, an influential American military strategist and a former pilot.
Commenting on the competition, Vincent “Jello” Aiello, a former US Navy pilot, told Forbes magazine that humans “excel in one important area when facing off against AI”.
“(Human pilots) know how to handle the type of uncertainty found in today’s combat engagements,” the magazine quoted him as saying. “Combat does not occur in sterile, static environments. It occurs in 3D, in real-time, where weather, your adversary, and a whole host of other factors come into play.”
Zhou Chenming, a researcher from the Yuan Wang, a Beijing-based military science and technology institute, agreed.
“Actual air combat is unpredictable and there are not any rules in a dogfight ... only human beings have the basic instinct to react with an innovative and diverse response.
“It’s still a long way, maybe dozens of years, before AI technology can be applied to real combat battlefields.”
But AI technology could make decisions in microseconds, far faster than its human counterpart, a fact that may have contributed to the victory in the competition, Zhou said.
The US Air Force said it started testing the use of AI and VR last year to help its pilots learn faster and improve retention.
A Beijing-based military insider said that in 2017 VR technology became a wider trend in China’s People’s Liberation Army pilot cadet training. VR helps the military increase accuracy and rigour and reduce training costs.
In 2014, Chinese pilot cadets were photographed by the PLA Air Force wearing VR headsets and using civilian Saitek X52 video game joysticks in simulated flying exercises. – South China Morning Post",final dogfight argument competition newcomer air force top pilot battle air superiority alphadogfight trial round qualifier veteran slap victor winner artificial intelligence algorithm sweep pilot maryland defence contractor heron system banger national guard pilot air force weapon school instructor graduate hour experience air force magazine pilot fast military analyst trial demonstrate feasibility effective intelligent autonomous agent capable adversary aircraft dogfight key sponsor project agency darpa agency department defence responsible development technology military competition multiple contractor contender martin falcon simulation banger report human pilot military analyst result defeat human real life combat hong kong military commentator song technology country virtual reality technology unable deal unpredictable battle scenario technology real combat application data technology cloud simulate scenario algorithm optimisation song commentator hong kong phoenix television pilot stealth fighter jet trial contest song experiment unique observe orient decide decision dogfight strategy john boyd influential american military strategist pilot competition vincent jello navy pilot forbes magazine human human pilot type uncertainty combat engagement magazine combat occur sterile static environment real time weather adversary host factor researcher yuan wang military science technology institute actual air combat unpredictable rule human basic instinct react innovative diverse response dozen technology real combat battlefield technology decision human counterpart victory competition zhou air force pilot faster retention beijing military insider technology trend china people pilot cadet training military increase accuracy rigour training cost chinese pilot cadet air force headset civilian saitek video game joystick exercise south china morning post,"[(3, 0.99601376)]",3
188995,Main,20,02/09/2020,Researchers: AI set to detect heart disease via selfies,,"BEIJING: Chinese medicine experts have been cooperating with computer scientists to create AI-powered technologies that can detect coronary artery disease through facial images.
In recent years, applications driven by artificial intelligence have been used in daily clinical practice like interpreting medical images, analysing electrocardiograms and tracking vital signs.
In the latest study, Chinese researchers explored the possibility of using AI to screen coronary artery disease via facial images.
Facial appearance has long been identified as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. 
Features such as male pattern baldness, earlobe creases, xanthelasmata (yellowish deposit of fat around or on the eyelids) and skin wrinkling are the most common predictors.
Researchers from the National Centre for Cardiovascular Diseases and Tsinghua University first enrolled 5,796 Chinese patients for the study. 
An AI algorithm was then tested on facial images of 1,013 other patients across nine hospitals.
According to the results published in the European Heart Journal, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 54%, outperforming the usual prediction model of coronary artery disease.
Sensitivity refers to an algorithm’s ability to designate a patient with a disease as positive, while specificity is the test’s ability to designate a patient without disease as negative.
The researchers said further studies are needed to make a practical application, as the current low specificity of the algorithm raises a concern of false-positives.
Overall, the results suggested that a deep learning algorithm can assist coronary artery disease detection, holding promise for pre-test screening of the disease in communities. — Xinhua",chinese medicine expert computer scientist technology coronary artery disease facial image application artificial intelligence clinical practice medical image electrocardiogram vital sign chinese researcher possibility screen coronary artery disease facial facial appearance indicator cardiovascular risk feature male pattern baldness earlobe xanthelasmata yellowish deposit fat eyelid skin common predictor researcher national centre cardiovascular disease university chinese patient algorithm facial image patient hospital european heart journal algorithm sensitivity specificity usual prediction model coronary artery disease sensitivity refers ability designate patient disease positive specificity test ability patient disease negative researcher study practical application current low specificity algorithm concern false positive deep learning algorithm assist coronary artery disease detection promise pre test disease community,"[(6, 0.9914323)]",6
185493,Lifestyle,4,24/08/2020,Harnessing AI as a firefighting tool,Researchers have developed artificial intelligence models that will eventually be able to predict wildfires and megafires.,"IN the collective imagination, global warming is responsible for the increasing power and frequency of forest fires. However, this is only partially true. 
As paradoxical as it may seem, some researchers suggest that the growing strength of fires is also due to the efficient work of fire services. By systematically extinguishing burning vegetation, firefighters would have inadvertently created the conditions for more and more fires.
This observation is based on the recent discovery of the essential role played by wildfire in the periodic regeneration of forests: the theory is that the oldest woods will naturally catch fire from the sun’s heat to make way for fresh growth.
Rise of megafires
This cycle is now being amplified by climate imbalances, which have disrupted the frequency of fires. As a result, forest fires are increasingly powerful and difficult to control to the point where we have now entered an era of megafires like those that have been observed in Australia, the Amazon, and more recently in Siberia.
Footage of millions of acres of burnt vegetation and hundreds of thousands of dead animals have raised awareness of the environmental and safety risks posed by such huge blazes.
In this context, prevention is the best remedy. Scientists and firefighters working together to develop new tools that can take into account the complexity of how fires emerge and spread have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to provide solutions.
Controlled burn
The main advantage of AI is its capacity to rapidly perform highly complex calculations that humans would take several days to resolve. 
For these calculations to be accurate, researchers have to feed massive amounts of information on past fires, associated meteorological conditions and vegetation into a computer. 
The goal is to enable the machine to mathematically link all of the data in a model that scientists can then use to predict future wildfire outbreaks.
The archiving work necessary for projects of this kind can take months, and even years, to optimise the AI agent’s understanding of the environment that it is supposed to supervise.
Several research groups are already experimenting with these futuristic firefighting tools, among them teams at the WiFire Lab in California, United States and the University of Alberta in Canada. 
Thanks to predictions provided by these AI agents, among other things, firefighters will soon be able to take advantage of recommendations for prescribed burns to save certain parts of the forest while allowing the natural process of forest regeneration to take its course. – AFP Relaxnews",collective imagination global warming responsible power frequency forest fire true paradoxical researcher strength fire efficient fire service vegetation firefighter condition fire discovery essential role wildfire periodic regeneration forest wood fire sun heat fresh growth rise cycle amplified climate imbalance frequency fire forest fire powerful difficult control era megafires australia amazon siberia footage million burnt vegetation hundred thousand dead animal awareness environmental safety risk huge blaze context prevention remedy scientist firefighter tool complexity fire spread artificial intelligence solution burn main advantage capacity complex calculation human day calculation researcher massive amount meteorological condition computer goal enable machine data model scientist future wildfire project month agent understanding environment supervise futuristic firefighting tool team lab california united university canada prediction agent firefighter recommendation burn forest natural process forest regeneration afp relaxnews,"[(9, 0.99236)]",9
185269,Main,24,23/08/2020,Researchers develop AI breath test device to detect virus,,"JERUSALEM: A team of Chinese and Israeli researchers has devised a novel artificial intelligence (AI) breath analyser test to detect Covid-19 rapidly, the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) said.
The new device was developed by Technion researchers in collaboration with the University of Science and Technology of China, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Anhui Provincial Chest Hospital, all three located in the city of Hefei.
The device meets the need for a non-invasive, rapid and inexpensive testing method to screen Covid-19 positive individuals, especially pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers.
It is an intelligent nanotechnology consisting of a nanomaterial-­based sensor array, which can rapidly detect Covid-19 from specific volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath.
It can detect disease-specific biomarkers in exhaled breath with 92% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity, Technion said.

183175,Lifestyle,3,17/08/2020,AI helps Brazil fight pandemic,,"Doctors in Brazil, the country with the second-highest number of cases and deaths in the ­coronavirus pandemic, have a new tool in their fight against Covid-19: artificial intelligence to detect infections.
Under-testing remains a huge problem in the sprawling South American country, but AI is ­helping fill the gap, thanks to a system called RadVid-19 ­developed using algorithms from German company Siemens and Chinese firm Huawei.
Brazil has been hit harder by the pandemic than any country except the United States, with nearly 2.8 million infections and 95,000 deaths.
Experts say the numbers would be much higher if there were more widespread testing.
RadVid-19 seeks to fill that gap, and help doctors decide the right course of treatment for their patients.
It analyses chest X-rays and CT scans to find spots on patients’ lungs that are likely markers of infection by the new coronavirus.
“The software identifies those areas and estimates the probability of a case of Covid-19,” says Marcio Sawamura, deputy head of the radiology center at the University of Sao Paulo Clinical Hospital.The program shows doctors on a computer screen how their patients’ lungs are changing over time and enables them to analyse the white and yellow circles ­marking potential infection.
The software is being used by 43 Brazilian hospitals, 60% of them public, thanks in part to funding from the Inter-American Development Bank.
It is not a replacement for a lab-based diagnosis by a physician.
But it can help doctors decide what treatment to pursue during the sometimes long wait for lab results to come back, in a country where no large-scale testing ­campaign has been launched and President Jair Bolsonaro faces ­criticism for downplaying the ­pandemic.
Creativity in crisis
“Since Brazil is testing less than it should, CT scans and X-rays end up being used as diagnostic tools,” says Arthur Lobo, a radiologist in the northern city of Belem.
“It’s helped us reach diagnoses when we were in doubt.”
That was welcome relief in the early stages of the pandemic in Brazil, when doctors were racing to keep up with a rapidly exploding infection curve, says Claudia Leite, a professor in the radiology and oncology ­department at the University of Sao Paulo.“At the beginning, we were ­really in anguish, because ­sometimes the lab results were taking a long time to come back and the patient would start ­getting worse, developing breathing ­difficulty, and we still didn’t have a diagnosis,” she says.Using AI, she says, “we were able to conclude it was Covid and take the right measures. And the test results later confirmed it.”RadVid-19 had analysed 10,700 X-rays and CT scans as of the end of July.

181095,StarBiz,4,11/08/2020,Artificial intelligence  in a nutshell,,"Intelligence is something natural that every human possesses at different levels of life and the level, of course, depends on the measure of IQ and/or experience. Meanwhile, the word artificial is pretty much understood by being a copy of something natural produced by human. 
It is like the artificial flavouring you have in foods and beverages, as an example, the taste of durian in coffee; without the presence of that thorny fruit, tempting but weird.
If one combines the words artificial and intelligence, like the durian-flavoured coffee, you will have the creations of human intelligence without the presence of the natural yet powerful brain.
The “brain” is now taken over by intelligent machines that work and react like humans, slowly exceeding the potential of our natural thinking capacity. We often nod as if we understand every bit of the AI but the way it works is still perplexing to many.
How does the brain work?
Now that we understand the aim of AI is to imitate the thinking process in making decisions, it is inevitable for us to first comprehend the manner of how the human brain works. 
How do you come down to the decision of sipping that cup of durian-flavoured coffee prepared by your mother- in-law for example?
The brain consists of a billion nerve cells which coordinate your actions supported by a network of neurons that process inputs from the natural sensors of human being. Smells, visions, sounds and touches are the inputs from your nose, eyes, ears and fingertips which act as the sensory devices. 
The coffee in a cup presented to you is a matter of interest. All the inputs gained from the observations combined with your experiences are then processed by the brain before the big decision of sipping or refusing the cup of coffee is made. Still unclear?
Now imagine your actions in gaining the inputs. By the look of the liquid inside the cup being black, your brain classifies it as coffee. 
Smelling the aroma, you can tell that it has durian in it. Hearing continuous persuasion from your wife, “Drink it! It’s nice”, your brain tells you that sipping the coffee is of great importance to your marriage. 
You start touching the side of the cup; this time your brain tells you that the temperature is right. Combined with the knowledge that this coffee was prepared by your mother-in-law, therefore it wouldn’t be toxic (it might not apply to everyone); the decision you made is to sip it.
How does AI work?
Traditionally, AI is just a series of algorithm based on inputs and historical data. It is like the daily calculators with memories function but by means of very far more complex mathematics solving potencies.
Nowadays, AI is a very sophisticated tool with self-learning capability and often related to big data analytics. 
For as much you need to punch in the numbers that requires solving on your calculators, the same goes with AI solver, and these are referred as inputs.
This time around, imagine, you are blindfolded, handcuffed at the back of your body, ear plugged and nose fully stuffed. Your brain is now paralysed as the sensors can no longer supply its inputs in making decision about the coffee presented.
In letting the AI to act as your brain and decide whether to ignore or sip it, the acquisition of inputs must now be made available.
An electronic thermometer, digital camera, chemical sensors and microphone are simple probes to gather the necessary inputs imitating your finger, eyes, nose and ears.
Once all the signals from the probes are sent to the AI solver, decision is made by solving all that in pre-input formulas. 
It can be commands in hundreds of lines at which the answer to it is yes or no, metaphorically like the answer you get after punching the sign equal on your typical calculator. The major important features of the AI compared to traditional computers would be the ability to learn from historical data. It fixes the algorithm after every single iteration and this can be considered as the biggest breakthrough of mankind, very often referred as deep learning by the scientist. Identical to the human brain that uses experience to improve decision making, the more situations being fed into a machine, the more intelligent it gets day by day.
What is the risk of AI?
The biggest question frequently asked every time I finish my lectures is the potential of AI taking over humanity. 
My answer is always consistent, it will one day, but not in a hundred years. 
Mind you, the period can be shortened if the infrastructure improves tremendously by new findings, what is that? I will now be introducing more metaphor from this point forward.
Let us go back to the durian flavoured coffee example to understand the resources needed for AI to improve decision making.
When you decide to drink the coffee, the decision is made in a split of a second to of course, avoid the nagging from your mother in law. That is the unique ability of our god created brain; it processes information faster than the lightning. 
This is still in the infant stage with AI, the processor needs to be much faster and robust, and opposite to your phone that gets “hang” every now and then.
Next is to understand the learning process through the historical data or better known as data training. Human logic in thinking is so complicated and varies between cultures.
The type of smiles directed to you by your other half carries different meanings between a go or no go.
Only after years of marriage you would have all the experience to understand those smiles. That is data training complications in AI, scientist requires tremendous amount of inputs and outputs for the decision making and it would require massive investment for the gathering and processing activities.
The AI will eventually have the risk of overtaking human at the very end. 
Why would I say that? 
It is because the machine doesn’t age as fast as human being and starts losing the capability to think. Like a wise man become wiser with age, same goes with the AI getting smarter with data trainings. 
However, the later doesn’t carry the potential of being senile. 
An AI machine will remember every bit of inputs fed into it for as long you don’t erase it, meanwhile a wise man might one day, forget where is that reading glasses he wore just five minutes ago. 
Recently AI is popular with prediction, patterns of human behaviour are classified before the machine can decide on what information to feed. 
Take Google for example, it is now working like magician, feeding every interest that is related to you based on your browsing history. 
To whose advantage? That’s still a big question unanswered.
On that note, I would like to end this article by reminding the readers that we, humans, don’t often get to be a wise man at the age of 94 that is fit to think based on the vast experience he had. 
Contradictory to that, machines will never lose its memory and will only improve as the days go by. Grab a book and start reading before it (the AI) really takes over.……

177753,Lifestyle,5,03/08/2020,XOX ADVANCES CONSUMER EXPERIENCE WITH AI,,"ALTHOUGH consumer-based 
artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its infancy, many users the world over have been exposed to components of this new technological advancement in their daily lives.These AI parts range from 
simple elements that are integrated in social media, to more advance state-of-the-art face recognition, voice recognition, search tools, smart home, virtual assistant 
and more. 
There is no denying that AI is here to stay and is lauded as the bedrock of an advanced digital 
lifestyle. 
Throughout the years, AI has fuelled global consumerism in many ways. And one of the ways 
it works perfectly is through algorithms. 
According to the Oxford Dictionary, an algorithm is a 
“process or set of rules to be 
followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, 
especially by a computer”.
Advent of AI
But how does AI figure in? 
Well, have you ever casually mentioned looking for something to someone, only to have an advertisement for that item popping up on your browser, although you’ve haven’t searched for it online yet? 
That’s AI.
Today’s algorithms are constantly being improved upon to provide better performing recommendation systems. 
They now have parameters that can be fine-tuned to near perfection and made ready to serve consumers.
Dedicated ecosystem
Realising the importance of incorporating AI into its core practice, virtual mobile network operator (MVNO) XOX is taking the lead in the industry by creating its own AI ecosystem. 
This system will seamlessly attune itself to current consumer behaviours and is set to be a game changer in the industry. 
XOX’s AI ecosystem will leverage expertise in key areas to synergise between advanced technology and consumer needs. 
The company ensures a harmonised AI landscape by creating 12 key areas – XOX City (AI vending machines), cloud solutions, partnerships, fintech, insurance, marketplace, e-wallet, remote working, loyalty programme, digital ID and email, its proprietary BLACK app, and logistics.

175125,StarEdu,2,26/07/2020,Charging electrical vehicles with AI,,"MOVING towards a more sustainable future, an optimal Electric Vehicle (EV) charging system that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the works to facilitate wider use of the vehicle. 
“There are still many technical challenges that need to be overcome in order to ensure the widespread utilisation of EVs in transportation sectors. The development of an optimal EV charging scheme is an on-going project that is crucial to maximise the economic and environmental benefits of EVs,” said Asst Prof Dr Lim Wei Hong, UCSI University’s Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment deputy dean.
Invited as a visiting research scholar by National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT), Taiwan, in December 2019, Dr Lim had the opportunity to work with his former advisor Prof Dr Leehter Yao in developing a new EV charging scheduling scheme.
Dr Lim’s main responsibility was to refine the algorithm design, and to implement coding as well as perform simulation analysis and prepare the manuscript.
“This project covered several crucial pillars of Industry Revolution 4.0 such as advanced simulation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing. Two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were also addressed in this project: Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities),” Dr Lim said.
One of the innovative points about the research project was the application of AI to predict the charging and discharging priority of each EV based on user behaviour. 
“AI was found to be an excellent approach to represent the relationship between the charging and discharging priority of EV with those input parameters such as the arrival and departure time of EVs, battery capacity time of EVs, initial energy stored in EV batteries, and EV staying time in parking stations,” Dr Lim said.
The research paper has been submitted to the international journal IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid and is currently under review.
“EVs have been acknowledged as the greener, more cost-efficient means of transportation and with battery charging as easy as charging one’s hand phone, it is certainly an option that seems more suitable for the present rather than just being reserved for the future,” Dr Lim said.
As EVs are powered by electricity, he said widespread use can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and subsequently lower air pollution and global warming.
Renewable energy such as solar power can be integrated into the EV parking station to fully or partially fulfil the power demands in charging the EVs, leading to the development of more sustainable infrastructures.
Dr Lim obtained his PhD from Universiti Sains Malaysia in 2014 and went on to NTUT as a post-doctoral researcher.

169657,Main,26,12/07/2020,The future is AI technology,Global collaboration can fight pandemic and revive economies,"SHANGHAI: Due to Covid-19, the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) 2020 in Shanghai this week adopted a hybrid model where offline exhibitions and online displays took place simultaneously to showcase the latest artificial intelligence (AI) applications and frontier development.
More than 500 AI experts and executives, including Nobel laureates and Turing Award winners, attended this year’s WAIC held from Thursday to yesterday with the theme of “Intelligent Connectivity, Indivisible Community”.
AI has already demonstrated its potential to transform societies, economies and industries, but this is just the beginning, according to experts at the conference. 
WAIC plays a critical role in bringing people together to learn from one another and identify ways of collaborating to achieve more.
In recent years, AI has begun to play a significant role in many sectors. Prompted by the need to contain Covid-19, people around the world are looking toward AI-based techniques to aid the anti-pandemic fight.
Companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, SenseTime and iFlytek have been among the first to join the fight. Data modelling, crowd screening, and tracing contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases have been widely used to help control the spread of the coronavirus.
SenseTime, an AI-technology firm with its China headquarters and Global R&D headquarters in Shanghai that specialises in computer vision and deep learning, participated in this year’s event.
During the outbreak of Covid-19, SenseTime collaborated with seve­ral hospitals and medical institutions across China to assist Covid-19 diagnoses. 
The company upgraded its diagnosis application, which dramatically improved the effectiveness, accuracy, and speed of the current analysis of CT scans with the help of AI algorithms.
Screening large crowds is another area where AI shows its potential, particularly in public spaces such as the metro. AI firm Megvii, another exhibitor at WAIC, launched a remote temperature measurement system in subway stations in Beijing to help screen out passengers with a high fever. 
Compared with manual detection, the system can examine up to 300 people in one minute without disrupting passenger flows.
Shen Xiangyang, a professor from Tsinghua University, said during the conference that AI technology could play a significant role in remote diagnoses, vaccine development, virus analysis and global coordination.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to rising demand for online services, which at the same time created many new scenarios for AI applications. Many experts attending the WAIC saw AI as a new engine to stimulate growth in the post-coronavirus era.
Zhu Min, chairman of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University, was upbeat about the prospects of the AI industry.

163991,StarBiz,4,29/06/2020,Tapping into 5G and AI,,"AGAINST fears of a second wave of coronavirus in the US and other countries, some companies in the semiconductor supply chain are tapping on the upcoming trends in 5G and artificial intelligence.
One such company is UWC Bhd that has been receiving orders despite the lockdowns.
For the long term, it intends to move up the value chain in the semiconductor industry to produce more front-end products.
UWC also sees prospects in the life science sector and even if an effective vaccine against the coronavirus is found, priorities on safety and health will ensure continued usage of healthcare-related equipment.
During the lockdown in China, the group did get some diversion of jobs from existing customers, which they accepted and are in the midst of delivery; it also received more enquiries from new customers.
With a plan to increase capacity, UWC is hiring engineers but finds that talent is hard to come by, even though there are so many unemployed people.
With the movement control order (MCO) period coming to an end and worldwide businesses gradually resuming, the group expects stronger sales from the second half onwards.
During the MCO, UWC was restricted to operate at 50% capacity which had resulted in a slowdown in work for March and April.
But it still managed to grow its revenue and profit after tax, year-on-year, by 45.7% and 65.9% respectively for the third quarter ended April 30.
Demand has been exceeding supply and despite the current disruption in the supply chain, UWC is able to meet a big portion of the demand.
Things will further improve when the MCO is lifted, and the Malaysian economy is on a gradual path of recovery.
As supply chain operations rev to full force, UWC’s operations will also reach 100% capacity.
The completion of work that has been backlogged will neutralise the weaker output during the MCO period.  
High demand
“We are optimistic that this high level of demand will sustain into the future,’’ said UWC deputy CEO Matin Ng.
Orders for the semiconductor sector remained strong during the MCO period, with no cancellations to date.
The group did incur higher operating expenses such as logistic costs, as well as expenses related to its production and standard operating procedures in sanitisation.
Overall, UWC is bullish on the semiconductor industry, as technology advancement will accelerate with the adoption of 5G and artificial intelligence.
Major countries are investing more into the semiconductor industry which is one of the foundational technologies that provides the edge in innovation.
The group’s strategy to produce more front-end products will help garner higher profits and margins.
More orders are also expected from the life science segment, where UWC is working closely with a new client to develop Covid-19 related equipment.
The life science business grew 6%, quarter to quarter; it contributed 20% to the latest quarterly results.
Amidst ongoing efforts to expand its customer base for the life science business, a second wave of coronavirus will potentially increase orders for its Covid-19 related test equipment and components.
Even if an effective vaccine is found, laboratory tests will still be conducted to enhance the effectiveness of the vaccine, or to detect any potential mutation of the virus.
“We ventured into the life science business a few years ago, and this has proven to be a very stable business for the group,’’ said Ng.UWC has 830 employees and plans to hire more engineers, in line with its expansion plans.
But amidst the bullish outlook on its businesses, its biggest challenge is to search for the right talent, especially following plans by multinationals to set up factories in Penang.
To create its own pipeline of talent, UWC is providing scholarships and working on the matter with institutes and universities.
The group aims to increase automation processing to reduce the usage of human capital and the likelihood of making errors.
Industrial robotic arms and collaborative robots or cobots are used on the production floor; due to the ramp-up in business, UWC has bought three units of automated material handlers instead of one, as stated in its listing prospectus.
More analytic software is being used; liquid crystal displays showing live data are installed on the production floor and computers or tablets are attached to machines for machine or shopfloor integration.
“We are on track to become a visual factory,’’ said Ng. “With just the tip of a finger, we are able to access our systems to track overall equipment effectiveness and machine performance.’’
With the data extracted from the machines and integrated with its cloud system, it is able to perform big data analysis.
During the lockdown period, UWC had requested for video conferencing to carry out the process of qualifying products.
This minimised disruptions to its operations, as it continued to receive enquiries from new and existing customers.

163785,Main,26,28/06/2020,‘AI plays vital role in pandemic fight’,Experts: Robotics and technology have big potential to curb Covid-19,"Beijing: Artificial intelligence has played a vital role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and has been widely applied in various sectors with tremendous potential, becoming the driving force of scientific and technological development, according to experts at the 14th Vision China event.
Jointly organised by China Daily and the Information Office of Tianjin Municipal People’s Government, the event, titled “Intelligence New Era: Innovation, Energization and Ecology”, was broadcast online to a global audience on Tuesday night. 
It coincided with the ongoing Fourth World Intelligence Congress, an online event that started on the same day and runs until Wednesday in Tianjin.
The city’s future development relies on intelligent technology, said Chen Zhemin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Tianjin Municipal Committee and head of the committee’s Publicity Depart­ment, while underlining that “Tianjin has given great importance to intelligent manufacturing and AI, which play a leading role in socio­economic development”.
According to Chen, the city has transformed and upgraded all factors in the whole process in the industrial chain and the life cycle of the manufacturing industry. 
It has completed 911 intelligent transformation projects, and cooperated with enterprises to sign 200 agreements, with a total investment of 261 billion yuan (RM157bil).
Chen said the city will promote technological innovation, develop intelligent industries and promote the intelligent upgrading of Tianjin’s manufacturing industry.
Zhou Shuchun, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily, said that during the pandemic a host of AI technologies have come to the fore, which has become key for China in the fight against the virus.
“AI has become a major driving force for the new round of technological and industrial revolution. 
“It is profoundly changing the way people work, live and learn and pushing human society towards an intelligent era of human-computer cooperation, cross-sector collaboration and joint creation and sharing,” Zhou said.
In particular, Zhou noted that Tianjin is a pioneer in AI city construction and has become a leader in China’s AI development. 
The intelligent technology industry gives a strong impetus for Tianjin to achieve high-quality development.
Now, Tianjin is shaping up to become a high-tech hub and has rolled out a series of supportive policies to develop the AI sector.
In December 2018, the city unveiled a three-year plan to boost the innovative development of seven AI-related industrial chains, including the independent and controllable information system, intelligent security, big data, advanced communications, intelligent connected vehicles, industrial robots and intelligent terminals.
“AI is helping a lot to deal with unprecedented situations,” said Ehud Levy, managing partner at Canaan Partners Israel and venture partner at Lenovo Capital, adding that AI is playing an increasingly important role in various sectors across the world. — China Daily/ANN",artificial intelligence vital role fight pandemic applied sector tremendous potential driving force scientific technological development expert china event china daily office tianjin municipal people government event intelligence era innovation energization ecology broadcast online global audience tuesday night ongoing fourth intelligence congress online event day run wednesday tianjin city future development relies technology chen zhemin committee communist party china tianjin municipal committee head committee publicity ment tianjin intelligent manufacturing play role socio economic development chen city upgraded factor industrial chain life cycle manufacturing industry intelligent transformation project enterprise sign agreement total investment yuan bil city technological innovation intelligent industry intelligent upgrading tianjin manufacturing industry shuchun publisher editor chief china daily pandemic host technology key china virus major force round technological industrial revolution people learn human society intelligent era human computer cooperation cross sector collaboration joint creation zhou zhou tianjin pioneer city construction leader china development intelligent technology industry strong impetus tianjin quality development tianjin tech hub series supportive policy sector december city plan innovative development industrial chain independent controllable system intelligent security data communication intelligent vehicle industrial robot intelligent terminal lot deal unprecedented situation levy partner canaan partner israel venture partner lenovo capital role sector daily ann,"[(0, 0.99512345)]",0

159689,StarBiz,3,18/06/2020,HCTM UKM ties up with  Green Packet on AI scanner,Hospital one of first few in country to have device,"PETALING JAYA: Green Packet Bhd has installed its KipleLive thermal scanners at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HCTM UKM), making it one of the first few hospitals in Malaysia to install artificial intelligence (AI) thermal scanners. 
KipleLive is a community-based safety solution that is recently incorporated with a built-in framework for Outbreak Prevention. 
Comprising AI thermal scanners, an app for users, and a backend platform for management, KipleLive helps the hospital adhere to the stringent standard operating procedures (SOPs) outlined by the government.
This entails having accurate contact tracing while allowing the hospital to operate at its full capacity through digitisation.
Green Packet group managing director and CEO CC Puan lauded HCTM UKM for its commitment to embark on digital innovations to uphold the high standard of healthcare in Malaysia. 
“We are pleased to be a technology partner for HCTM UKM. 
“I hope that more healthcare practitioners will follow suit and leverage on the power of digital technologies to combat the spread of Covid-19,” he said in a press release yesterday, adding that Green Packet is committed and determined to build safe and secure communities.
As HCTM UKM prepares for the new normal and joins the list of Green Packet’s nationwide “We Are Ready” campaign, the Covid-19 infection transmission is expected to be broken in due time.
HCTM UKM director Prof Datuk Hanafiah Harunarashid said it is imperative to protect frontline healthcare professionals in order to attend to the needs of the people.
“It is good news to all Malaysians that the daily reported new Covid-19 cases have decreased over the past few days but we cannot sit back and rest on our laurels. 
“We still need to continue practising good personal hygiene and maintain safe social distancing at least one metre away from others,” he said. 
The thermal scanners installed at HCTM UKM’s main entrance of the lobby as well as other entrances that are accessible to staff, patients and visitors, will ensure that frontline professionals are always protected while making the hospital a safe environment for patients and visitors.
Apart from that, all manual work and manpower required can be greatly reduced by banking on digital technologies that are able to streamline procedures as well as AI thermal scanners that scan and measure each individual’s body temperature within seconds, 
Additionally, KipleLive can be used symbiotically with another Green Packet fintech brand KiplePay, an e-wallet payment system. 
The long-term partnership between Green Packet and HCTM UKM will open up more opportunities, such as enabling an end-to-end cashless ecosystem for HCTM UKM patients to make online payments on hospital bills using a single app.
Earlier, Green Packet, via its associate G3 Global Bhd, had already installed AI thermal scanners in a number of buildings in Malaysia, including Istana Negara, Parliament buildings, and the KL International Airport. 
Progressing from that, Green Packet then installed KipleLive thermal scanners at Paradigm Mall, The Ascent Corporate Towers, Pavilion Tower, Rafflesia Private and International Schools, Desa Park International schools as well as the premises of The Star Media Group and Sin Chew Daily.
Recently, Green Packet had partnered with United Chinese School Committee’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong) to deploy KipleLive thermal scanners across 63 independent Chinese secondary schools nationwide.
Just two weeks after Green Packet’s We Are Ready campaign launch on May 7, the group achieved a sales pipeline of 10,000 units of KipleLive.
KipleLive has also been receiving significant interest from a number of countries including Indonesia, Vietnam, the US, as well as the European Union Parliament, which is keen to explore the usage of KipleLive in European countries.
With such high demand for KipleLive, Green Packet is optimistic that KipleLive will achieve its sales target of RM60mil by the third quarter of this year. As such, this will be a boost to the overall earnings of Green Packet this year.
Green Packet offers four types of KipleLive solutions, catering to various needs of each business or premise.
The SenseTime Nebula is for use in public or open areas such as airports, railway stations, bus terminals and hospitals.
This device is able to detect up to 10 people at one time and is capable of capturing a lot of data within a three metre radius.
Meanwhile, the SenseThunder-E and SenseThunder-E Mini, priced between RM20,000 and RM80,000 is suitable for use in restricted and closed areas such as building entrances, shopping malls, hotels, and government buildings.
Small or medium size areas such as offices, schools, restaurants and factories can deploy the KipleLive FR thermal scanner which is now offered at RM6,800 per unit.
Additionally, Green Packet offers a rental option as low as RM449 for small businesses.",jaya green packet bhd kiplelive thermal scanner canselor tuanku muhriz universiti kebangsaan malaysia hctm ukm hospital install artificial intelligence thermal scanner community safety solution framework outbreak prevention thermal scanner user platform management kiplelive adhere stringent standard operating procedure sop outlined government entail contact hospital operate capacity digitisation green packet director ceo puan hctm ukm commitment embark digital innovation uphold standard healthcare malaysia pleased technology partner ukm hope healthcare practitioner suit leverage power digital technology spread covid press release yesterday green packet determined build safe secure community ukm prepares normal join green packet nationwide ready campaign covid infection transmission broken time hctm ukm director prof datuk hanafiah harunarashid imperative protect frontline healthcare professional people news malaysian covid decreased day rest laurel personal hygiene safe social distancing metre thermal scanner hctm ukm main entrance lobby entrance accessible staff patient visitor frontline professional hospital safe environment patient visitor manual manpower reduced banking digital technology procedure thermal scanner scan measure individual body temperature kiplelive green packet fintech brand kiplepay payment system term partnership green packet hctm ukm opportunity cashless ecosystem hctm ukm patient online payment hospital bill single app green packet associate global bhd thermal scanner building istana parliament building international airport green packet kiplelive thermal scanner mall ascent corporate tower tower rafflesia private international school park international school star medium chew daily green packet united chinese school committee association malaysia zong deploy kiplelive thermal scanner independent chinese secondary school nationwide week green packet ready campaign launch sale pipeline unit kiplelive receiving country indonesia vietnam european union parliament usage kiplelive european country kiplelive green packet optimistic kiplelive achieve sale mil quarter earnings green packet green packet offer type kiplelive solution business premise sensetime nebula public airport railway station terminal hospital detect people time capable capturing lot data metre radius sensethunder sensethunder mini suitable building entrance mall hotel government building medium size office school restaurant factory kiplelive thermal scanner unit green packet offer rental option low business,"[(7, 0.9970041)]",7
158773,Lifestyle,4,15/06/2020,Human fighter pilot to go up against AI-manned aircraft,,"Earlier this month, Air Force Magazine reported that the US Air Force will be putting a human pilot up against an autonomous aircraft in air-to-air combat next July.
Researchers for the United States Air Force are developing an AI-powered autonomous aircraft that could ­potentially take down a human-manned aircraft; their goal is to put a human pilot up against this AI in air-to-air combat – which was a challenge inspired by ­statements made by Elon Musk earlier this year – in July 2021.
While the head of the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan states that the research team is “probably going to have a hard time ­getting to that flight next year... when the machine beats the human... If he does it, great.”
This project was originally launched in 2018.
The research team’s leader Steve Rogers says: “Our human pilots, the ­really good ones, have a couple thousand hours of experience. What happens if I can augment their ability with a system that can have literally millions of hours of training time?... How can I make myself a tactical autopilot so in an air-to-air fight, this system could help make decisions on a timeline that humans can’t even begin to think about?”
If the team accomplishes this, they intend to implement this type of ­technolo- gy in maintenance operations and battle planning software. – AFP Relaxnews",month air force magazine air force human pilot autonomous aircraft air air combat july researcher air force autonomous aircraft human aircraft goal human pilot air air combat challenge statement elon musk head pentagon joint artificial intelligence center gen jack shanahan team hard time flight machine human project team leader rogers human pilot couple hour experience augment ability system million hour time tactical autopilot air air fight system decision human team accomplishes implement type technolo maintenance operation battle planning software relaxnews,"[(3, 0.9869026)]",3
155785,StarBiz 7,16,06/06/2020,Seizing the opportunities of AI,SMEs to benefit from more cost-effective use of hardware,"DESPITE the breakneck speed of technological advancements these days, one of the first things that Alvin Koh noticed when he returned home from Australia was the lack of effort in driving the development of machine learning to solve real problems. 
Noting that there was enormous potential in this technology, the former banker took it upon himself to exploit the capabilities of machine learning to make life a lot easier for other businesses. 
He started artificial intelligence (AI) optical solution company Blinkware Technology in 2013 to help organisations reduce the risk of failures or downtime in their operations. 
The firm’s main application also enables companies to increase operational efficiency, improve product compliance, process data instantly, get a better understanding of their supply chain and customers as well as reduce cost thanks to predictive maintenance.
Koh, who is also chief executive officer, says the company’s technology platform can be applied across various industries such as automotive, textiles, rubber, F&B, logistics and agriculture.
Leveraging its platform can help businesses save considerable cost and time, he says, especially when compared to using manual labour – which is still the case for many companies today – to perform the same tasks. 
Blinkware has its own patented optical recognition software technology that enables lower-cost hardware to function at the same quality and efficiency as expensive higher-end peripherals. 
Although Blinkware started life as an interactive digital media company providing tailored motion sensor advertising and marketing solutions, it moved into deep tech in 2016 with the development of its own AI optical recognition technology which can be tailored to fit multiple industries.
What sets them apart from most other software providers in the market is their ability to integrate their camera technology into existing platforms by utilising low cost hardware that makes use of 2D cameras.
This is especially useful in pushing for wider adoption of automation in manufacturing processes among small and medium scale companies, which make up a large chunk of South-East Asia’s economies. Many of these companies do not have the budget to spend on high-end devices but stand to benefit greatly from the efficiency of the latest technology.
For now, Blinkware is focused on growing its hardware agnostic AI system for manufacturing services as it has one of the biggest growth potential for the company.
Citing a study by global consulting firm McKenzie, Koh says the manufacturing sector in Asean could add up to US$311bil in additional value creation by adopting automation and AI in the production process.
The company’s optical research and development (R&D) arm is currently working with automotive manufacturers to provide integrated optical technology which can be used to assist them in the quality control processes.
Making partnerships
Blinkware has been approached by a China-based strategic investor and is also fielding interest from a Japanese partner who are keen to tap into the company’s proprietary AI technologies, Koh highlights.
During the coronavirus period, other investors have also shown keen interest in Blinkware as the company expands its capabilities into AI medical technology and peripherals for mass Covid-19 testing and surveillance, he adds.
Blinkware currently has eight shareholders. Koh holds the second largest stake in the company.
On a wider scale, though, the firm has formed a strategic business alliance with Fujitsu to expand across South-East Asia. The Japanese IT company has helped expand its technologies and opened up markets for Blinkware in Indonesia and Thailand. 
“This collaboration provides us with technical as well as sales and marketing support,” he says.
This will give the company a boost as it looks to recover and grow from the shadows of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Koh expects the next 18 months to be an extremely volatile period as many sectors are still trying to grasp the full impact of the lockdown and businesses are still trying to navigate the situation and put their recovery plans into action.
“Specifically related to our clients and their industries, the current turbulence coupled with economic uncertainties due to the lockdown have rendered many non-essential manufacturers inoperable. This has heavily impacted their production, causing massive losses due to high operating costs and low productivity.
“They are still working through cost cutting exercises and refocussing their budgets to ensure high productivity remains at the lowest cost.
“For us, this period has provided many new projects, in particular, manufacturing clients who are still running very traditional processes heavily dependent on human resource, onsite management of the supply chain and manual reporting channels,” shares Koh.
The company is currently busy reaching out to various SMEs and government agencies to educate them on the use of AI in their processes to reduce human bias and increase accuracy in their workflow. 
The good thing about using technology is that even if a system makes a mistake, it can be fixed.
Given the huge potential for the company, Blinkware is looking to expand its team to meet future demand. 
It currently has 30 employees, of which 70% are programmers. 
One of the biggest challenges for Blinkware is to hire enough talents to scale faster and ensure quick and smooth delivery of its projects. The competition for talents in the AI industry is fierce and expensive, says Koh, and Blinkware has to compete for highly skilled programmers and IT engineers with companies from the Silicon Valley, China and even Singapore. 
With good talents in high demand, the company – or even Malaysia – will have to put out an offer enticing enough for their consideration. 
Operating in a new normalBeing a young company, Blinkware has little problem embracing the new working conditions recommended under the movement control order. 
Koh says the company has been productive even when half the team is working from home, leaving only critical roles including R&D to be based in the office.
“With a high percentage of our workforce being millennials, working from home was second nature to our team members and surprisingly, it has worked very well of us with a heightened sense of accountability and greater engagement levels across departments.
“In fact, we had been toying with the idea of working from home since 2019 but this pandemic forced that decision for us and has proven to us that it works. 
“Our client meetings are now predominantly via web-conference calls and with the reduced time needed for travel to meet with our clients, it allows our front line operations to be more engaged with our clients during the day, which is also the reason that we are continuing the work from home practice even after this,” says Koh.
Those working at the office continue to abide by strict standard operating procedures on social distancing. He notes that seating arrangements have been changed and meetings limited to four people in a room at one time. 
“This is to ensure we are playing our role to combat and eradicate the relapse of Covid-19 with the relaxing of the lockdown in phases,” he adds.
He also says that many of the practices during the movement restrictions have taught the company to forego certain costs.
“Being able to consolidate our work force without multiple offices or branches and costly asset maintenance and inventory have enabled us to keep lean, nimble and cost effective during this difficult and uncertain times.”
As a company with its core operations in software, Blinkware is in a good position to pivot and grow fast during this time due to its fairly low operational cost model.
Koh says the company continues to educate potential clients and various stakeholders on the benefits of AI technology. 
For example, in the medical field, the company aims to combat future respiratory-type pandemics by arming countries with AI technology to help them manage their first line of defence. The technology will be able to ensure that every individual can be checked efficiently.
This will allow more individuals who have tested negative for Covid-19 to return to work, thereby reducing the risk of a drastic economic downturn. 
Additionally, it will also help positive and possible cases to be segmented for isolation and testing to prevent future outbreaks.
Other areas that the company is developing which will be ready soon are platforms that will be able to identify individual temperatures in a mass setting using AI facial recognition and highly accurate thermal sensing cameras. 
This will help organisations take a proactive approach to combating the spread of Covid-19 in mass areas including airports, religious gatherings and schools as they reopen.
“Most of our overheads are currently in R&D-based human capital, which we are still hiring to grow our talent base of programmers to expand on our new projects,” he says.
Having spent close to 20 years working in the relatively rigid financial industry, making the switch to a fast-paced technology and AI world has certainly not been an easy feat for Koh. But leading a team of innovators with a clear vision on how to bring the benefits of technological advancements to businesses has been rather satisfying. 
Perhaps, Blinkware is also positioned to be the local champion to push other businesses to level up the technology value chain, he mulls as he concludes.",breakneck speed technological advancement day koh australia lack effort development machine solve real enormous potential technology banker exploit capability machine life lot easier business artificial intelligence optical solution company blinkware technology organisation risk failure operation firm main application company operational efficiency product compliance process data supply chain customer cost predictive maintenance koh chief executive officer company technology platform industry automotive textile logistics platform business considerable cost time manual labour company task blinkware optical recognition software technology lower cost hardware function quality efficiency expensive peripheral blinkware life interactive digital medium company tailored motion sensor advertising marketing solution deep tech development optical recognition technology fit multiple industry set software provider market ability camera technology platform low cost hardware camera wider adoption automation manufacturing medium scale company south east asia economy company budget device benefit technology blinkware hardware agnostic system manufacturing service biggest growth potential company study global consulting firm koh manufacturing sector asean bil additional creation automation production process company optical development arm automotive manufacturer integrated optical technology assist quality control partnership blinkware china strategic investor japanese partner keen tap company proprietary technology highlight coronavirus period investor blinkware company capability medical technology peripheral covid surveillance blinkware shareholder largest stake company scale firm strategic business alliance fujitsu expand east japanese company technology market indonesia thailand collaboration technical sale support company recover grow pandemic koh month volatile period sector impact lockdown business situation recovery action client industry current turbulence economic uncertainty rendered essential manufacturer inoperable production massive loss cost low productivity cost cutting budget productivity lowest cost period project client traditional process dependent human resource onsite management supply chain manual reporting channel share company busy smes government agency process human bias increase accuracy technology system huge potential company blinkware team meet future demand employee programmer biggest challenge hire talent faster quick smooth delivery project competition talent industry fierce expensive koh blinkware compete skilled programmer engineer company valley china singapore talent company malaysia offer consideration company blinkware condition movement control company productive half team critical role office percentage workforce millennials team sense accountability engagement level department idea decision client meeting conference call time travel meet client front operation client day reason practice koh office continue strict standard operating procedure social note arrangement meeting limited people time role combat relapse covid lockdown phase practice movement restriction company forego cost force multiple office branch costly asset maintenance inventory lean nimble cost effective difficult uncertain time company core operation software blinkware position pivot fast time low operational cost model company potential client stakeholder benefit technology medical field company combat future respiratory type pandemic country technology manage defence technology individual individual negative covid return risk drastic economic downturn positive isolation prevent future outbreak company ready platform individual temperature facial recognition accurate thermal camera organisation proactive approach spread covid mass airport religious gathering school overhead human capital hiring grow talent base programmer project close rigid financial industry switch technology easy feat koh team innovator benefit technological advancement business blinkware local champion push business technology chain mull concludes,"[(2, 0.7106219), (3, 0.058692772), (8, 0.2291218)]",2
155099,StarBiz,3,04/06/2020,"Green Packet, FIVE unveil AI-powered petrol stations",New service set to reinvent users’ experience,"PETALING JAYA: As part of the second series of its campaign known as #DigitalReady, Green Packet Bhd has teamed up with Five Petroleum Malaysia Sdn Bhd (FIVE) to launch the first artificial intelligence (AI)-powered petrol station in Malaysia and reinvent the whole fuelling users’ experience.
In a statement, Green Packet said the collaboration with FIVE brought forth the frictionless and cashless digital experience across all FIVE petrol stations, leveraging on the frontier technologies like AI and machine learning and coupled with a suite of Green Packet’s technological innovations such as e-KYC, e-wallet, payment gateway and license plate recognition.
According to FIVE managing director Datuk Seri Dr King Lim, it is the company’s mission to help Malaysia to raise its bar to the next development. 
“Like in FIVE, our first AI-powered petrol station is not just meant to provide a hassle-free fuelling experience. It is also to harmonise the whole digital solution from making fuel payments to purchasing goods in the retail stores under one integrated platform.”
On top of that, FIVE will co-develop a new mobile application with Green Packet via its Kiple brand to facilitate cashless payment as well as including a spectrum of offerings in the app itself such as loyalty, discounts and P2P transfer.
“Gone are the days of carrying around an additional membership card. With our new mobile application, users can enjoy a much personalised experience in their every trip to the nearest FIVE stations as they can register, collect, manage and spend their rewards within the application. This will eventually create strong brand loyalty among users,” Lim added. 
Green Packet managing director C.C. Puan said the system could automatically identify the driver’s pre-filled information by scanning the user’s license plate upon entering the petrol station. 
Once identified, users will receive a push notification on their mobile phone for quick approval of payment. The refuelling process then becomes more efficient and less tedious.
“Beyond that, the facial recognition technology will allow the users to enjoy a much pleasing experience in both loyalty and rewards at Woo! Mart, Five’s own branded convenience stores. 
“Users simply have to stand in front of a point-of-sale terminal and the AI system will identify the user and approves user profile which is linked to your mobile phone,” Puan said. 
The collaboration between Green Packet and Five signifies the commitment to be at the forefront of technological transformation. 
Lim said this is in line with its efforts to being digitally ready as FIVE is a unified energy company that aims to meet Malaysia’s growing demand for fuel in ways that are economically, environmentally and socially responsible.",jaya series campaign green packet bhd petroleum malaysia sdn bhd launch artificial intelligence petrol station reinvent user statement green packet collaboration frictionless cashless digital experience petrol station frontier technology machine learning suite green packet technological innovation wallet payment gateway license plate recognition director datuk seri lim company mission malaysia bar development petrol station provide hassle free experience harmonise digital solution fuel payment retail store platform top develop mobile application green packet kiple brand facilitate cashless payment spectrum offering loyalty discount day additional membership card mobile application user personalised experience trip nearest station collect manage spend reward application strong brand loyalty user green packet director puan system driver pre user license plate petrol station user push notification phone quick approval payment process efficient tedious facial recognition technology user experience loyalty reward convenience store user front sale terminal system user approves profile phone puan collaboration green packet signifies forefront technological transformation lim effort ready energy company meet malaysia demand fuel responsible,"[(5, 0.99392825)]",5
155147,StarBiz,10,04/06/2020,Hedge fund  in Sweden trounces return goal with  rare AI model,,"STOCKHOLM: A Swedish hedge fund called Volt Capital Management AB has run circles around its own return target by relying on a form of artificial intelligence (AI) it says is unique.
Volt Diversified Alpha Program was created in early 2017 by Jukka Harju, a former researcher at Lynx Asset Management. It only has about US$30mil under management, but this year it’s delivered more than double the 10% return target it promised investors. Instead, they’ve received 24%. In March, when Covid-19 triggered a global selloff across markets, Volt had a positive return of 12%.
Patrik Safvenblad, the fund’s chief investment office, said his models, once plugged into Volt’s AI programme, helped him position for the slump in oil markets, and for gains in bonds and the dollar. “It’s best for us when the fundamentals change,” he said in an interview last week. “For example this year, the oil price fundamentally changed.”
Volt is doing “something that is unique within machine learning,” Safvenblad said. “We take the power of fundamental models – we believe in fundamentals, fundamentals matter – we combine that power with machine learning.”
He said the model addressed two problems. “If you trade based on fundamentals, you have a problem to choose from your models. If you do machine learning based on technical signals, you risk ending up with so called false positives.”
Instead, Volt has chosen 200 models it thinks will make money. But, “we don’t know exactly when, or how to weight them,” Safvenblad said. “We use machine learning to handle the daily weighting problem.”
Some of the hedge fund industry’s biggest names experienced deep setbacks in March, including firms run by Ray Dalio, Michael Hintze and Adam Levinson, Bloomberg News reported in April.
Volt’s investment horizon is relatively short, averaging about 12 trading days. The fund holds roughly 70 positions at any given time. Its analysis shows that the economy will stay weak.
“Basically the systems are positioned for continued economic weakness, with focus on commodities, equity markets still appear too volatile for significant positions,” Safvenblad said. He’s short soft commodities and “a bit short equities.” Long bets include gold, platinum, fixed income in Europe and the US, as well as the Greenback against the Australian and New Zealand dollars.

154429,StarBiz,10,02/06/2020,Hedge fund in Sweden trounces return goal with rare AI model,,"STOCKHOLM: A Swedish hedge fund called Volt Capital Management AB has run circles around its own return target by relying on a form of artificial intelligence it says is unique.
Volt Diversified Alpha Programme was created in early 2017 by Jukka Harju, the former head of research at Lynx Asset Management. 
It only has about US$30mil under management, but this year it’s delivered more than double the 10% return target it promised investors. Instead, they’ve received 24%. In March, when Covid-19 triggered a global selloff across markets, Volt had a positive return of 12%.
Patrik Safvenblad, the fund’s chief investment office, says his models, once plugged into Volt’s AI programme, helped him position for the slump in oil markets, and for gains in bonds and the dollar.
Volt is doing “something that is unique within machine learning,” Safvenblad said in an interview. “We take the power of fundamental models – we believe in fundamentals, fundamentals matter – we combine that power with machine learning.”
He says the model addresses two problems. “If you trade based on fundamentals, you have a problem to choose from your models. If you do machine learning based on technical signals, you risk ending up with so called false positives.”
Instead, Volt has chosen 200 models it thinks will make money. But, “we don’t know exactly when, or how to weight them,” Safvenblad said. “We use machine learning to handle the daily weighting problem.”
Some of the hedge fund industry’s biggest names experienced deep setbacks in March, including firms run by Ray Dalio, Michael Hintze and Adam Levinson, Bloomberg News reported in April.
Volt’s investment horizon is relatively short, averaging about 12 trading days. The fund holds roughly 70 positions at any given time. Its analysis shows that the economy will stay weak.
“Basically the systems are positioned for continued economic weakness, with focus on commodities, equity markets still appear too volatile for significant positions,” Safvenblad said. He’s short soft commodities and “a bit short equities.” Long bets include gold, platinum, fixed income in Europe and the U.S., as well as the Greenback against the Australian and New Zealand dollars.
“The market is always right,” Safvenblad said. “We don’t think we know better than the market. So when something goes against us, we decrease exposure to those positions, models and sectors.

149903,StarBiz,9,20/05/2020,"Sony, Microsoft strike dealThe outcome is a tiny AI chip with huge potential",,"TOKYO: Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp have partnered to embed artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into the Japanese company’s latest imaging chip, a big boost for a camera product the electronics giant describes as a world-first for commercial customers.
The new module’s big advantage is that it has its own processor and memory built in, which allows it to analyse video using AI tech like Microsoft’s Azure, but in a self-contained system that’s faster, simpler and more secure to operate than existing methods.
The two companies are appealing to retail and logistics businesses with potential uses like optimising warehouse and factory automation, quantifying the flow of customers through stores and making cars smarter about their drivers and environment.
At a time of increasing public surveillance to help rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus, this new smart camera also has the potential to offer more privacy-conscious monitoring. 
And should its technology be adapted for personal devices, it even holds promise for advancing mobile photography.
Instead of generating actual images, Sony’s AI chip can analyse the video it sees and provide just metadata about what’s in front of it -- saying instead of showing what’s in its frame of vision. 
Because no data is sent to remote servers, opportunities for hackers to intercept sensitive images or video are dramatically reduced, which should help allay privacy fears.
Apple Inc has already proven the efficacy of combining AI and imaging to create more secure systems with its Face ID biometric authentication, powered by the iPhone’s custom-designed Neural Engine processor. 
Huawei Technologies Co and Alphabet Inc’s Google also have dedicated AI silicon in their smartphones to assist with image processing. 
These on-device chips represent what’s known as edge computing: handling complex AI and machine-learning tasks at the so-called edge of the network instead of sending data back and forth to servers.
“We are aware many companies are developing AI chips and it’s not like we try to make our AI chip better than others,” said Hideki Somemiya, senior general manager of Sony’s System Solutions group. 
“Our focus is on how we can distribute AI computing across the system, taking cost and efficiency into consideration. Edge computing is a trend, and in that respect, ours is the edge of the edge.”
Sony’s advance is to eliminate the need for transfers within the device itself. 
Whereas Apple and Google still use conventional image sensors that convert light particles into computer-readable image formats for their chips to read, Sony’s new part is capable of doing the analytical work without any data leaving its physical boundaries.
The AI-capable sensor may also help advance augmented reality applications. 
The two US giants, whose iOS and Android operating systems control practically the entire smartphone market, are heavily invested in AR development. 
Google Maps now offers the option to show 3-D directions atop a video feed of a user’s surroundings while Apple is planning new 3-D cameras on its next set of iPhones in the fall. 
The agenda-setters of the mobile industry are looking for ever smarter mobile cameras, spurring the demand for more sophisticated imaging gear.
Sony already enjoys a substantial lead as the world’s foremost provider of image sensors, counting Apple, Samsung Electronics Co and every major Chinese smartphone maker among its customers along with pro camera stalwarts like Hasselblad V, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Nikon Corp.
Its next set of customers may be automakers.
The AI-powered Sony sensor is capable of recording high-resolution video and simultaneously conducting its AI analysis at up to 30 frames each second. 
That rapid, up-to-the-microsecond responsiveness makes it potentially suitable for in-car use such as detecting when a driver is falling asleep, Sony’s Somemiya said. 
Without the need for a “cloud brain” as some existing systems have, Sony’s AI sensor could hasten the adoption of smart-car technology.
”This on-chip approach enables a system design to be more flexible and even optimised, given that the cost of image processing, which is one of the most compute-intensive tasks for autonomous driving, can be offloaded from an electronic control unit,” said Shinpei Kato, founder and chief technology officer of Tokyo-based Tier IV Inc, which develops self-driving software. — Bloomberg",tokyo sony corp microsoft corp embed artificial intelligence capability japanese company chip boost camera product electronics giant commercial customer module advantage processor memory analyse video tech microsoft azure system simpler secure operate method company retail logistics business potential optimising warehouse factory automation flow customer store car driver environment time public surveillance rein coronavirus smart camera potential offer privacy conscious monitoring technology personal device mobile photography actual image chip analyse video metadata front frame vision data server opportunity hacker sensitive image allay privacy fear apple create secure system biometric authentication iphone custom neural engine processor huawei technology google silicon smartphones assist image processing device chip edge complex machine learning task edge network data server aware company chip chip hideki senior manager sony system solution distribute system cost efficiency consideration edge trend respect edge edge sony advance eliminate transfer apple google conventional image sensor light particle computer readable image format chip sony capable analytical data physical boundary capable sensor advance reality application giant android system control entire smartphone market development google map option direction video feed user surroundings apple planning camera iphones agenda setter industry smarter mobile camera demand imaging gear sony substantial lead foremost provider image sensor apple samsung electronics major chinese smartphone maker customer camera stalwart fujifilm holding corp set customer automaker sony sensor capable resolution video analysis frame rapid microsecond responsiveness suitable car driver asleep sony somemiya cloud brain system sony sensor hasten adoption smart car technology chip approach system design flexible optimised cost image compute intensive task autonomous offloaded electronic control unit shinpei kato founder chief technology officer tokyo tier develops software bloomberg,"[(6, 0.9964874)]",6

129095,StarMetro,5,28/03/2020,THE FUTURE THROUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,,"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) is the wave of the future. This area of computer science emphasising the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans is heavily influencing and taking over the way we get on with daily life. 
More importantly, it is revolutionising industries and improving the way business is done, being already widely used in applications including automation, data analytics and natural language processing.
On a bigger spectrum, from self-driving cars to voice-initiated mobile phones and computer-
controlled robots, the presence of AI is seen and felt almost everywhere. 
As more industries shift towards embracing the science of incorporating human intelligence in machines so the latter can function, think and work like humans, the demand for human capital with the relevant skill and expertise correspondingly increases. 
As such, the question is, how do engineering students ride this wave and make the most of it? 
AI has a high learning curve but the rewards of a career in AI far outweigh the investment of time and energy. 
Unlike most conventional careers, AI is still in its infancy stage although several modern nations have fully embraced the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Taking this into account, UCSI University has taken the initiative to develop the Bachelor of Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) programme.
The nation’s best private university for two years in a row, according to the two recent QS World University Rankings exercises, proactively defines its own AI curriculum to offer educational content that can help increase the supply of AI engineers with job-ready graduates and real world experiences. 
The AI programme at UCSI consists of a number of specialisations and several overlapping disciplines, including mathematical and statistical methods, computer sciences and other AI core subjects to provide a conceptual framework in providing solutions for real-world engineering problems. 
The first two years covers core theoretical knowledge such as mathematics and statistics, algorithm design and computer programming, as well as electrical and electronics. 
Students will progress to the AI subfields by selecting the specialisation elective tracks covering emerging areas such as machine learning, decision-making and robotics, perception and language and human-AI interaction, among others. 
UCSI Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment dean Asst Prof Ts Dr Ang Chun Kit pointed out that AI was “unavoidably” the way forward. 
“We aim to nurture the new generation workforce with the right skills set and knowledge on smart technologies to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation into a smart and modern manufacturing system. 
“This programme was developed with a vision to provide the foundation for future growth in producing more complex and high-value products for industry sectors in Malaysia,” he said.
Leading the faculty in which 46 of its members have PhDs, Ang emphasised the university focuses on research attachment abroad and has established partnerships with key industry players. 
The faculty also stands out in terms of receiving grants to advance high impact projects. 
Students from the faculty are also annually selected for researches at world-renowned universities such as Imperial College London and Tsinghua University. 
The faculty also strives to give students field experience through internships at various top companies. 
An example would be Harry Hoon Jian Wen, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student. He was selected to go to the University of Queensland for a research attachment while also successfully completing his internship at Schneider Electric.

125941,StarEdu,5,22/03/2020,AI can’t replace accountants,,"YES, automation exists in accounting. And no, you won’t lose your job to it.
Since its existence in 1970s, the Sunway University Business School Department of Accounting has not seen a decrease in the number of accounting jobs, says its head Prof Raymond Patrick McNamara.
In fact, there are still a lot of accounting-related posts out there and according to a 2018 Tracer Study, 95% of accounting and finance graduates find employment within six months of graduating.
On Jobstreet Malaysia, there are about 3,400 accounting positions in Malaysia with about 1,300 of them within the taxation sector at the beginning this year, he notes.
He says there is in fact a shortage of accountants as many don’t remain in that role throughout their career,  especially in big firms.
“If you go into the corporate field, you can work your way up to chief executive officer, chief financial officer or managing director.”
Individuals in these roles spend more time doing negotiations for the company and helping to chart the company’s direction, he adds.
He says that an accountant’s role is essentially to provide information and assure that the information is correct.
“So, there’s no need to worry that accounting jobs will be gone anytime soon due to IR4.0.
“Don’t confuse accounting with bookkeeping.”
He explains that bookkeeping is the actual recording of the transaction and this was already automated since the 70s.
That process continues to be automated. So, big transactions in those companies like payroll and accounts payable have been outsourced to companies that specialise in doing just this, he says.
“These areas are also easy to automate because it’s fairly routine,” he says, adding that these jobs have been slowly disappearing over the past 50 years.
Although bookkeeping roles have been automated, accountants still need to know how to do it to ensure there is no wrong information logged into the systems.
In the end, their job is still to supervise the automated processes.
An accountant, he says, has to pay close attention to the systems.
Some of these systems are taught to accounting degree students in a standard subject called Accounting Information Systems.
This subject covers, among others, the controls within accounting computer systems to ensure that there is no fraud and that information is complete, accurate and timely.
“For example, accountants need to be alert to ensure credit fraud does not occur.
“Some computer systems would not be able to detect transaction flaws like charging interest on credit cards when the bill has already been paid but not reflected in the system.
“This is where an accountant’s keen eye is needed as this is not an easily automated process.”
Human intelligence, he adds, is still needed to think of ways that fraud can be committed and to ensure that the computer systems are not compromised.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) looks like it can do this “thinking” for us, the sky high cost means only massive firms can afford them, he continues.
He says that there has been talk of AI taking over credit scoring but that hasn’t materialised.
“Both Google and Facebook said they were going to do it but they haven’t.
“It’s not as easy as people think. You hear that computers are better at forecasting than humans are but there’s no research evidence to support that,” he adds.
The field of forensic auditing is being affected by IR4.0 though, he says, adding that this is due to developments in data analysis.
Cybercrime, he says, is an area of great concern and it’s where one needs a combination of auditing and technological skills.
“You can train as an auditor but you also need to be trained in technology. We want to get our students future-ready.
“We give them the thinking skills that make them adaptive,” he says, stressing that accountants need to understand why a process exists and why it needs to be enhanced to prevent fraud.",automation lose job existence university business school department accounting decrease accounting job prof raymond patrick mcnamara lot accounting post study accounting finance employment month jobstreet malaysia accounting position taxation sector shortage accountant role career firm corporate field chief executive officer chief financial officer director individual role time negotiation company chart company direction accountant role provide assure correct job confuse accounting bookkeeping actual transaction process transaction company account payable outsourced company easy routine job role accountant wrong system job process accountant pay close attention system system degree student subject accounting system subject cover computer system fraud complete accurate timely accountant alert credit fraud computer system detect transaction flaw credit card bill reflected system accountant keen eye process human intelligence fraud committed computer system artificial intelligence sky cost massive firm talk credit google facebook easy people computer human evidence support field forensic development data analysis cybercrime concern combination technological skill auditor technology student ready thinking skill adaptive accountant understand process exists prevent fraud,"[(9, 0.9940079)]",9
119615,StarBiz,4,09/03/2020,How artificial intelligence will change the construction sector,,"In 2016, to the shock of many, the Alpha Go computer program, developed by Google Deep Mind, managed to beat professional Go player Lee Sedol. 
Experts believed then that development of a program that could beat the complex game of Go was at least five years in the future.
That momentous event spurred the Chinese government to release the next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in 2017. 
This is a comprehensive strategy to advance the development of AI in China to catch up with the US by 2020, overtake it by 2025 and become the global leader by 2030. Thus the seeds of the current US- China trade war were sown.
Meanwhile in the US, private corporations such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Tesla are largely responsible for the US’s current competitive edge in AI. The US also remains the leader when it comes to the amount of funding, number of AI firms and patents filed. 
US companies such as Google, Nvidia and Tesla have a leading edge in manufacturing the most powerful AI chips.
Across the causeway, the Singapore Government has just rolled out their national strategy on AI. It has invested US$500mil on AI and other digital technologies through 2020 and has attracted Chinese and American firms to the country with policies that support AI research.
The global construction industry has grown by only 1% per year over the past few decades.
Compare this with a growth rate of 3.6% in manufacturing, and 2.8% for the whole world economy. Productivity, or the total economic output per worker, has remained flat in construction. 
In comparison, productivity has grown 1500%in retail, manufacturing, and agriculture since 1945.
One of the reasons for this is that construction is one of the most under-digitized industries in the world and is slow to adopt new technologies (McKinsey, 2017). McKinsey expects the spread of AI in the construction sector to be modest in the immediate future. 
Nonetheless, a shift is coming.
AI is an aggregative term for describing when a machine mimics human cognitive functions, like problem-solving, pattern recognition, and learning. Machine Learning is a subset of AI.
Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” from data, without being explicitly programmed. At the moment machine vision and speech recognition already surpass human capabilities.
Machine learning and AI are helping make job sites more efficient and saving money.
AI solutions that have made an impact in other industries are beginning to emerge in the construction industry. The potential applications of machine learning and AI in construction are vast. 
Let’s look at a few examples to illustrate the potential changes.
In order to plan and design the construction of a building, 3D models need to take into consideration the architecture, engineering, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) plans and the sequence of activities of the respective teams. 
The challenge is to ensure that the different models from the sub- teams do not clash with each other. 
The industry is trying to use machine learning in the form of “generative design” to identify and mitigate clashes between the different models generated by the different teams in the planning and design phase to prevent rework. 
Thanks to “generative design” tools, even complex plumbing, mechanical and electrical work can be theorised within 3D modelling design, meaning logistical challenges can be worked through while planning, saving time and costs in the building stages.
Robotic capability is still quite primitive and requires controlled conditions for AI to be useful. However autonomous construction equipment are already in production that can undertake repetitive tasks like earthworks and haulage of earthwork materials, pouring concrete, bricklaying, welding, and demolition.
These machines can undertake these works more efficiently than their human counterparts. The growth of efficient construction will be further enabled by the rollout of 5G wireless technology. 
5G will provide the platform for remote operations of construction equipment miles away. This will be a significant boost to productivity of civil construction where the constraint of operators will become nullified.
Construction sites are especially risky due to the number of variables involved. One way to mitigate the dangers on a construction site is to do as little as possible at the site – or move the construction site altogether. 
A combination of AI and robotics can produce prefabricated construction, which allows building elements to be built in a controlled factory and then transported to a construction site. 
This process controls many of the would-be hazards on a standard construction site, and completes the most dangerous tasks without risking human injury. 
A second application that is poised to have a huge impact on construction is image tagging and analysis. We already see powerful AI at work in social media, where algorithms identify facial patterns to automatically tag individual people with astonishing accuracy. 
The same AI technology, with new training, can be used to identify and analyse safety hazards, categorise and tag site photography, and send notifications when PPE is not being properly used on the job site. 
It can even be used to identify who is violating safety standards, and tag them for their supervisors to address the problem.
AI will have minimal impact on the labour component of the construction industry in the immediate future. Instead the initial impact will be white collar staff who will find that the mundane aspects of their work will get automated. 
This requires engineers, quantity surveyors and site inspectors to develop new skillsets to prepare for the future when AI will become more prevalent in the construction industry. 
So what can the industry do to prepare for the new paradigm that will emerge. Firstly institutions like Institution of Engineers, Institution of Quantity Surveyors and Institution of Surveyors need to instill greater awareness of AI among its members through articles in their monthly magazines, talks from experts in this field and the setting up of online research libraries for their members to keep abreast of the latest developments. 
Secondly, development boards like CIDB need to formulate and AI strategy for the Industry similar to what MDEC is undertaking for the SME’s.
The key success factor in AI deployment is in the collection of data that is tagged. Vast amount of data needs to be utilised to train AI computer logarithms to learn and be able to classify objects or make decisions. 
One approach is to have all drawings submitted for planning approval in BIM to ensure that building plans are digitised going forward. Finally, there will an explosive demand for data scientists.
MDEC predicts that there will be a demand for 15,000 data professionals in 2020 when currently there are only 7,000. If this skill shortage is not bridged then we will have to import these skilled professionals from overseas. 
Politically this will be difficult situation for the government as job losses by locals will be replaced by imported foreign professionals.
Our Shared Prosperity Vision will depend very much on how well our government, industry, professional institutions and learning institutions manage the profound changes that AI and Industrial Revolution 4 will bring.

However, there were already “protests” as a counsel during one of the cases heard argued that the application was a breach of two Articles of the Federal Constitution.
Article 5(1) states that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with the law, while Article 8(1) said all persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.
Outgoing Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong Dak Wah attended the hearings of four out of 11 drug possession cases punishable under Section 12(3) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 here yesterday. Wong clocked out and officially ended his service as Chief Judge on the same day. He said such challenges against the use of the technology was something the judiciary had anticipated when introducing a new system.
“Lawyers are entitled to make objections. This is a new tool for the court; unless it is tested in court, we will not know whether it is constitutional or not.
“It is also not proper for us to say whether it is constitutional or not, as that means we will be giving our views while in office.
“We will let the objection take its course, the counsel concerned is entitled to take it further if he wants to. But when we launched it (AI for data sentencing), we expected this sort of challenge. 
“Anything new which may infringe the rule of law or the Constitution – we have to take the challenge as it comes,” he said.  
In one of the cases, counsel Ham­id Ismail represented Denis P. Modi­li, 43, who pleaded guilty to possessing 0.01g of methamphetamine. 
Hamid proposed that sentencing be carried out without looking at the AI for the particular case, saying it was a breach of the two Articles.
“The court should confine to only materials presented in court.
“AI (use) is not in accordance with the law. Although the court can choose to ignore, I am afraid it might influence the decision,” he argued, adding that the amount of drugs found on Denis was also very small and proposed the sentence be less than five months’ jail.
After noting the objection, magistrate Jessica Ombou Kakayun said the court would proceed with the AI use, which makes recommendations based on information derived from the court’s database between 2014 and 2019, and listened to arguments from both sides.
The AI proposed 10 months’ imprisonment. 
Jessica sentenced the accused to 12 months’ jail, to run concurrently from his existing sentence of eight months from the date of arrest on Dec 16 last year.
Hamid said the defence would file an appeal to the High Court as it involved constitutional matters.
“Based on today’s events, I probably may oppose it in the future,” he said in a written text reply when asked if he would be challenging the use of AI for sentencing in general outside of yesterday’s case.",kota artificial intelligence data sabah court progressive move malaysian judiciary technology form aid punishment initiative effort parity deployed offence sarawak court dangerous drug drug possession penal code rape counsel heard application breach federal constitution article person life personal liberty save law article person equal law equal protection law chief judge sabah sarawak tan sri david dak wah hearing drug possession punishable dangerous drug yesterday service chief judge day technology judiciary system lawyer objection tool court court constitutional proper constitutional view office objection counsel data sort challenge infringe rule law constitution challenge counsel ham ismail denis modi guilty methamphetamine hamid breach article court material court law court ignore afraid influence decision amount drug sentence month jail objection magistrate jessica court proceed recommendation derived court database argument month imprisonment jessica accused month sentence month dec hamid defence file appeal court constitutional matter event oppose future text reply yesterday,"[(2, 0.993158)]",2
107563,Main,13,16/02/2020,Sabah judiciary to use AI,Artifical intelligence to be launched at KK Magistrate’s Court,"KOTA KINABALU: Artificial intelligence is set to make its way into Malaysian courtrooms when it is launched at a Magistrate’s Court here on Wednesday.
“It is going to be big step for the Malaysian judiciary,” Chief Judge for Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong Dak Wah said.
He said the artificial intelligence machine would recommend the likely sentence that a magistrate could give to a person found guilty of a crime.
“The use of AI will be the first in Asia. To my knowledge, no other country apart from United States uses it this way,” he said.
The full details and the standard operating procedures for such AI proceedings would be explained fully for public understanding during the launch, he said after opening the Borneo Colloquium on Environmental Justice here yesterday.
On the judicial discussion on environmental issues, he said the colloquium was to educate judges on the new areas of the law regarding environment and prepare them to hear such cases.
“There are many non-governmental organisations and lawyers who are active in this area (environment) and who are willing to take up environment cases,” he added.
He said that there was already an Environmental Court in Malaysia, which is presided by a Sessions Court judge whenever cases are heard.
The colloquium saw New Zealand’s Environment Court principal judge LJ Newhook and former Chief Justice of Malaysia Tan Sri Richard Malanjum sharing their experiences on handling environment cases.
Wong hoped that the discussions would expand the perspective on environment and ensure a more holistic approach in the administration of environmental justice.
In his speech earlier, he noted that he launched the “Wildlife Sentencing Guideline” last year in Kudat, Sabah.
“This guideline was a product of discussions between the court, the Sabah Law Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Whilst the guideline is not binding on the courts, this can be a useful guideline,” adding that it is hoped that there would be consistency in passing sentences in environmental cases.",kota artificial intelligence malaysian courtroom magistrate court wednesday step malaysian judiciary chief judge sabah sarawak tan sri david dak wah artificial intelligence machine sentence magistrate person guilty crime knowledge country detail standard operating procedure proceeding public understanding launch borneo colloquium environmental justice yesterday judicial discussion environmental issue educate judge law environment prepare hear governmental organisation lawyer active environment environment environmental court malaysia session court judge colloquium zealand environment court principal judge newhook chief justice malaysia tan sri richard malanjum experience environment wong discussion perspective environment holistic approach administration environmental justice speech guideline kudat sabah guideline product discussion court law society wide fund nature whilst guideline binding court consistency passing sentence environmental,"[(3, 0.9911841)]",3
102545,Main,20,31/01/2020,Setting up framework for AI in healthcare,,"GOOD health is an important prerequisite for sustainable development. It is goal number 3 in the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
But the cost to deliver 
good health continues to rise worldwide and many might not be able to afford it. This explains why health has also become an important election issue in both developed and developing countries. 
In Britain and the United States, the national health scheme has always been a contentious issue. We are fortunate that in Malaysia, the cost of delivering healthcare is still manageable.
Growing populations, demographic changes and a shortage of health practitioners are also putting pressure on the healthcare sector. At the same time, increasing amounts of digital health data and information have become available. How can we tap this vast data resource?
Artificial intelligence (AI) models are now being developed to learn from these large datasets. They offer the potential to assist with problems in medicine, for example in early detection, diagnosis and other medical decision-making. 
These advances promise to improve healthcare for patients and also provide much-needed support for medical practitioners.
Over the past decade, much investment has gone into research in the use of AI for health. Although there is immense potential, many issues, including regulation, potential for bias and adequate evaluation of efficacy, must first be addressed for safe and ethical implementation of AI in healthcare.
If the AI software is poorly designed or the data are biased or incomplete, errors can occur. So far, there is no agreed framework for assessing or reporting the results of health AI models as 
there are for development of 
new drugs.
Without such a framework, it is difficult to decide whether the AI model is sufficiently robust for wider application. Inadvertently, the absence of confidence is a major barrier to the uptake of AI 
in healthcare.
There is therefore the need to create a rigorous, standardised evaluation framework if the world is to realise the potential of this technology. Through the framework, the advantages and limitations of AI models in health can be effectively addressed. 
Responding to this need, two UN agencies, the World Health Organisation and International Telecommunication Union, have recently established a Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health, with active involvement of the German Fraunhofer Network. 
The focus group is tasked with developing a benchmarking process for health AI models that can act as an international, independent standard evaluation framework.
Since its establishment, this focus group has engaged medical, public health, AI, data analytics and policy experts to develop the framework. It is expected to develop processes for AI evaluation and specific benchmarks for each health topic. 
The AI models are also expected to offer improvements to the current practices in terms of quality and efficiency, leading to better health outcomes or cost effectiveness. 
Thus far, the focus group has developed 11 health topic groups in areas such as cardiovascular disease risk prediction, ophthalmology (retinal imaging diagnostics) and AI-based symptom checkers, but this approach is expected to be expanded to other tasks.
The benchmarking process would be done on secure and confidential test data. Ideally, the test data should originate from various sources to determine whether the use of an AI model can be generalised across different populations, measurement devices and healthcare settings.
We have been told that the benchmarking process for each use case within a topic needs to be defined. For many-use cases, it would be meaningful to compare model performance against human performance, or human performance with  AI assistance on the same task. 
Once these requirements are met, AI models can be submitted via an online platform 
to be evaluated with the test data. 
The benchmarking process would not only provide a reliable, robust and independent evaluation system that can demonstrate the quality of AI models but also an independent test dataset for model validation consistent with best practice recommendations for reporting multi-variable prediction models in health. 
The creation of a transparent process to evaluate health AI models is key to realising the potential of AI in improving human health worldwide. 
With the framework in place, there is no reason why AI cannot also be developed for the early prediction of a public health phenomenon like the Wuhan novel coronavirus which the world is now battling.

98569,Main,14,18/01/2020,AI on trial run in court,Sabah and Sarawak testing its use to determine sentences,"KUCHING: An artificial intelligence (AI) application to determine appropriate sentences for certain criminal offences will be used in a pilot project by the courts in Sabah and Sarawak.
Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong said data analysis by the AI application would serve as a guideline to judicial officers in deciding on sentences. 
He said this was aimed at improving efficiency and ensuring consistency in sentencing. 
“Every time the court passes a sentence, there are always complaints that there is disparity or inconsistency. 
“With this, hopefully, we will have consistent sentences being meted out by the court, and not one magistrate giving a fine and another giving two years’ imprisonment,” he said during a demonstration of the AI application after the opening of the legal year in Sabah and Sarawak here yesterday.
The AI pilot project will be used for two offences – drug possession under Section 12 of the Dangerous Drugs Act and rape under Section 376 of the Penal Code.
The application will analyse data for these offences gathered from cases registered in Sabah and Sarawak from 2014 to 2019. 
It will also analyse relevant information and parameters, such as the age of the accused, type and weight of drugs in cases of drug possession or age of victim and whether hurt was caused in rape offences, to come up with a recommended sentence.
Wong said the judiciary was now in the process of creating ground rules for the use of the application, including making known to the accused and their lawyers what the likely sentences would be if they chose to plead guilty.
He said the rules should be ready in a week or so.
Chief Justice Tan Sri Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat said it was timely for the judiciary to move along with technological advancement.
“I don’t see a reason why we should not embark on this. But of course we cannot rely 100% on technology, so there must be a human element as well.
“This is a pilot project and as we go along, we’ll see how it needs to be improved or otherwise,” she said.
Currently, courts and corrections departments around the United States use algorithms to determine a defendant’s “risk”, which ranges from the probability that an individual will commit another crime to the likelihood a defendant will appear for his or her court date. 
These algorithmic outputs inform decisions about bail, sentencing, and parole.
