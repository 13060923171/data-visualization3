741397,Main,21,17/10/2024,AI artist set to make auction history,,"London: The robot artist Ai-Da (pic), a humanoid powered by artificial intelligence, will be the first of its kind to have a painting sold at a major auction house, organisers said.
 The work, due to go under the hammer at Sotheby’s in London next month, is described as a “haunting” portrait of the English mathematician Alan Turing, considered one of the fathers of modern computing.
 Entitled AI God, the 2.2m-high portrait is expected to fetch between £100,000 and £150,000 (RM562,435 and RM843,653).
 The online sale, featuring a range of digital art forms, would explore the intersection between art and technology, according to Sotheby’s.
 The ultra-realistic robot is designed to resemble a human female with a face, large eyes and a brown wig, and is one of the most advanced in the world.
 It works by using AI algorithms and has cameras in its eyes and bionic hands.
 Aidan Meller, gallery owner and founder of Ai-Da Robot studio, led the team that created it with artificial intelligence specialists at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham in England.
 Meller said Turing, who made his name as a World War II codebreaker, mathematician and early computer scientist, had raised concerns about the use of AI in the 1950s.
 The artwork’s “muted tones and broken facial planes” seemingly suggested “the struggles Turing warned we will face when it comes to managing AI”, he said.
 Ai-Da’s works were “ethereal and haunting” and “continue to question where the power of AI will take us, and the global race to harness its power”, he added.
 In 2022, Ai-Da painted portraits of the acts headlining Glastonbury Festival including Billie Eilish, Diana Ross, Kendrick Lamar and Paul McCartney.

740881,StarBiz,8,16/10/2024,City-state keen to cooperate on AI-enabled manufacturing,,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is looking to work with more like-minded partners to advance artificial intelligence (AI) enabled manufacturing for a greener and more sustainable future, says Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. 
 These partnerships are a “critical enabler” of the republic’s manufacturing ambitions, noted Heng in a speech on Monday.
 “Such partnerships allow us to develop our respective strengths and support one another in navigating some of the difficult adjustments that come with transformation,” he said at the opening ceremony of the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific 2024 event. 
 This comes as Singapore remains on track to achieve its goal of increasing manufacturing value-added by 50% between 2020 and 2030, and positioning itself as a critical node for advanced manufacturing.
 At the event at the Singapore Expo, themed “Shaping a Sustainable Future with AI-Powered Manufacturing”, Heng said that the manufacturing sector globally accounts for around one fifth of global carbon emissions, so it is critical that the sector contributes and uses new green and sustainable solutions to boost global efforts to combat climate change.
 Another key trend will be the transformative impact of AI on the sector, which accounts for around 20% of Singapore’s gross domestic product.
 In his speech, Heng announced several initiatives and outlined ways local and overseas organisations can collaborate with the local manufacturing ecosystem.
 For example, Singapore and its partners have to work together to broaden platforms that translate scientific insights into “practical, innovative and viable” solutions. 
 To that end, the Advanced Manufacturing Centre of Innovation was launched on Monday by Enterprise Singapore, in collaboration with A*Star’s Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology and four polytechnics – Nanyang, Ngee Ann, Singapore and Temasek.
 The centre aims to support more than 800 local companies from the advanced-manufacturing sector over the next two years, in more than 100 joint innovation projects to generate new revenue streams.
 Such projects could include the development of chips to advance commercial medical products in the healthcare sector, and leveraging real-time machining data to support smart-factory projects. — The Straits Times/ANN",singapore partner advance artificial intelligence manufacturing greener sustainable future deputy prime minister heng keat partnership critical enabler republic manufacturing ambition speech monday partnership respective strength support difficult adjustment transformation ceremony industrial transformation asia pacific event singapore track achieve goal critical node manufacturing event singapore expo sustainable future manufacturing heng manufacturing sector global carbon emission critical sector contributes green sustainable solution global effort combat change key trend transformative impact sector account gross domestic product speech heng initiative local overseas organisation local manufacturing ecosystem partner broaden platform scientific insight practical innovative viable solution centre innovation singapore collaboration star institute manufacturing technology polytechnic ngee ann singapore temasek centre local company sector joint innovation project revenue stream project development chip commercial medical product healthcare sector real time data support smart factory project time,"[(6, 0.9927063)]",6
740873,StarBiz,11,16/10/2024,US to weigh further  crackdown on  AI chip exports,,"WASHINGTON: Biden administration officials have discussed capping sales of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips from Nvidia Corp and other American companies on a country-specific basis, people familiar with the matter say.
 The new approach would set a ceiling on export licences for certain countries in the interest of national security, according to the people, who spoke about the private discussions on condition of anonymity. 
 Officials are focused on Persian Gulf countries that have a growing appetite for AI data centres and the deep pockets to fund them, the people said.
 Deliberations are in the early stages and remain fluid, the people said, noting that the idea has gained traction in recent weeks. 
 The policy would build on a new framework to ease the licensing process for AI chip shipments to data centres in places like the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. 
 US Commerce Department officials unveiled those regulations last month and said there are more rules coming. 
 The agency’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees export controls, declined to comment. Nvidia, the market leader for AI chips, also declined to comment, as did Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 
 A representative for Intel Corp, which also makes such processors, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment but pointed to a joint statement by the United States and the UAE on AI. 
 In it, the two countries acknowledged the “tremendous potential of AI for good,” as well as the “challenges and risks of this emerging technology and the vital importance of safeguards”.
 Setting country-based caps would tighten restrictions that originally targeted China’s ambitions in AI, as Washington considers the security risks of AI development around the world. 
 Already, the Biden administration has restricted AI chip shipments by companies like Nvidia and AMD to more than 40 countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia over fears their products could be diverted to China. 
 At the same time, some US officials have come to view semiconductor export licences, particularly for Nvidia chips, as a point of leverage to achieve broader diplomatic goals. — Bloomberg",washington administration official sale artificial intelligence chip american company country specific basis people familiar matter approach ceiling export licence country national security people private discussion anonymity official persian gulf country appetite data centre deep pocket people deliberation stage fluid people idea traction week policy framework ease licensing process chip shipment data centre united arab emirate uae saudi arabia commerce department official regulation month rule agency bureau industry security export control comment nvidia market leader chip comment micro device representative intel corp processor request comment spokesperson white house national security council comment joint statement uae country tremendous potential risk technology vital safeguard country cap restriction china ambition washington considers security risk development biden administration chip shipment company amd country east africa asia fear product china time official semiconductor export licence nvidia chip leverage broader diplomatic goal,"[(8, 0.992928)]",8
740197,Main,16,14/10/2024,Becoming ‘AI confident’,,"THE government is actively fostering partnerships with industry leaders and strengthening collaboration among all stakeholders, including academia and industry players, to unlock artificial intelligence’s (AI) full potential. 
 By cultivating these alliances, it is positioning Malaysia as a leader in AI-driven innovation in South-East Asia while also increasing productivity and enhancing economic growth. 
 However, the rapid integration of AI technologies also raises significant concerns, particularly for the Malaysian workforce.
 A prevalent issue is the fear among employees that AI will “take over my job”. This anxiety is especially common among senior workers who may be less familiar with emerging technologies. AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Co-Pilot, and Google Bard have intensified these concerns, as many employees are facing a harsh reality check with the increasing automation of tasks. For employers, the appeal of AI lies in its promise of quick results and lower operational costs.
 It is crucial to promote a “humanising AI” culture within organisations. Rather than viewing AI as a replacement for human labour, employers should encourage the workforce to see AI as a tool that can enhance their daily work, enabling them to deliver more efficient and innovative results. 
 Organisations should invest in upskilling their employees by providing AI-related training that equips them with the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively. For example, courses focusing on AI-enhanced productivity tools, data analytics, or even programming AI systems can prove invaluable.
 This proactive approach not only benefits the company but also empowers employees to develop new competencies that open doors to emerging roles such as “AI Prompters,” “AI Managers,” and “AI Data Analysts”, positions that are yet to be widely recognised but hold significant potential for the future.
 For employees, it is imperative to stay informed about the latest AI developments and continuously upgrade their skills. Those who embrace AI will find that it serves as an enabler rather than a threat. By familiarising themselves with AI tools and integrating these technologies into their daily workflows, employees can gain a competitive advantage in the evolving job market. This approach will not only alleviate fears but also create a more harmonious and productive working environment where AI complements human expertise.
 It is worth noting that AI will not completely replace human roles at least not for some years to come. The technology still requires human intervention for its development, refinement, and ongoing management. 
 In essence, AI is a tool that extends our capabilities, much like an assistant with “super skills” that enhances our productivity and problem-solving abilities.
 By treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than a competitor, the workforce can harness its benefits without compromising human value.
 For Malaysia to fully realise its ambitions in the AI space, it is time for employers and employees to step out of their respective comfort zones and become “AI-fide” confident and capable in integrating AI into the workplace. This transformation demands a collective mindset shift towards lifelong learning and adaptability, which will enable us to not just survive, but thrive in this AI-driven era.

740389,Lifestyle,6,14/10/2024,Will AI win a Nobel Prize?,"As AI continues to disrupt various fields, researchers are racing to create ‘AI scientists’ that could one day contribute to Nobel Prize-winning discoveries.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence is already disrupting industries from banking and finance to film and journalism, and scientists are investigating how AI might revolutionise their field – or even win a Nobel Prize.
 In 2021, Japanese scientist Hiroaki Kitano proposed what he dubbed the “Nobel Turing Challenge”, inviting researchers to create an “AI scientist” capable of autonomously carrying out research worthy of a Nobel Prize by 2050.
 Some scientists are already hard at work seeking to create an AI colleague worthy of a Nobel, with this year’s laureates to be announced between Oct 7 and 14.
 And in fact, there are around 100 “robot scientists” already, according to Ross King, a professor of machine intelligence at Chalmers University in Sweden.
 In 2009, King published a paper in which he and a group of colleagues presented “Robot Scientist Adam” – the first machine to make scientific discoveries independently.
 “We built a robot which discovered new science on its own, generated novel scientific ideas and tested them and confirmed that they were correct,” King said.
 The robot was set up to form hypotheses autonomously and then design experiments to test these out.
 It would even program laboratory robots to carry out those experiments before learning from the process and repeating.
 ‘Not trivial’
 “Adam” was tasked with exploring the inner workings of yeast and discovered “functions of genes” that were previously unknown in the organism.
 In the paper, the robot scientist’s creators noted that while the discoveries were “modest”, they were “not trivial” either.
 Later, a second robot scientist – named “Eve” – was set up to study drug candidates for malaria and other tropical diseases.
 According to King, robot scientists already have several advantages over your average human scientist.
 “It costs less money to do the science, they work 24/7,” he explained, adding that they are also more diligent at recording every detail of the process.
 At the same time, King conceded that AI is far from being anywhere close to a Nobel-worthy scientist.
 For that, they would need to be “much more intelligent” and able to “understand the bigger picture”.
 ‘Nowhere near’
 Inga Strumke, an associate professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said that for the time being the scientific profession is safe.
 “The scientific tradition is nowhere near being taken over by machines anytime soon,” she said.
 However, Strumke added that “doesn’t mean that it’s impossible”, adding that it’s “definitely” clear that AI is having and will have an impact on how science is conducted.
 One example of how it is already in use is AlphaFold – an AI model developed by Google DeepMind – which is used to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on their amino acids.
 “We knew that there was some relation between the amino acids and the final three-dimensional shape of the proteins... and then we could use machine learning to find it,” Strumke said.
 She explained that the complexity of such calculations was too daunting for humans.
 “We kind of have a machine that did something that no humans could do,” she said.
 At the same time, for Strumke, the case of AlphaFold also demonstrates one of the weaknesses of current AI models, such as so-called neural networks.
 They are very adept at crunching massive amounts of information and coming up with an answer, but not very good at explaining why that answer is correct.
 So while the over 200 million protein structures predicted by AlphaFold are “extremely useful”, they “don’t teach us anything about microbiology”, Strumke said.
 Aided by AI
 For her, science seeks to understand the universe and is not merely about “making the correct guess”.
 Still, the groundbreaking work done by AlphaFold has led to pundits putting the minds behind it as front-runners for a Nobel Prize.
 Google DeepMind’s director John Jumper and CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis were already honoured with the prestigious Lasker Award in 2023.
 Analytics group Clarivate, which keeps an eye on potential Nobel science laureates, places the pair among the top picks for the 2024 candidates for the Prize in Chemistry, announced on Oct 9.David Pendlebury, head of the research group, admits that while a 2021 paper by Jumper and Hassabis has been cited thousands of times, it would be out of character for the Nobel jury to award work so quickly after publication – as most discoveries that are honoured date back decades.
 At the same time, he feels confident that it won’t be too long before research aided by AI will win the most coveted of science prizes.
 “I’m sure that within the next decade there will be Nobel Prizes that are somehow assisted by computation, and computation these days is more and more AI,” Pendlebury said. – AFP",artificial intelligence industry finance film journalism scientist revolutionise field nobel japanese scientist hiroaki kitano nobel turing challenge researcher scientist capable worthy nobel prize scientist create worthy nobel laureate oct robot scientist professor machine intelligence chalmers university sweden king paper colleague scientist adam machine scientific discovery robot science scientific idea confirmed correct king robot form design experiment program laboratory robot experiment process trivial adam exploring working function gene unknown organism paper robot scientist creator modest trivial robot scientist study drug candidate tropical disease robot scientist average human scientist cost money science diligent detail process time close nobel worthy scientist intelligent understand bigger picture inga strumke associate professor norwegian university science technology time scientific profession safe scientific tradition machine impossible impact science alphafold model google deepmind predict dimensional structure protein amino acid relation amino acid final dimensional shape machine strumke complexity calculation human machine human time strumke alphafold weakness current model neural network massive amount answer answer correct protein structure teach microbiology strumke science seek understand universe correct guess alphafold pundit mind front runner nobel google deepmind director john jumper ceo founder demis hassabis prestigious lasker award analytics eye potential nobel science laureate top pick candidate chemistry oct david pendlebury head paper jumper hassabis thousand time nobel jury award publication discovery decade time feel confident win science prize decade nobel prize computation computation day pendlebury afp,"[(7, 0.9956575)]",7
739827,StarEdu,5,13/10/2024,‘Align TVET with AI’,,"A continuous effort to reform Malaysia’s technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is important, says Prof Dr Razali Hassan from the Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Faculty of Technical and Vocational Education.
 The success of Budget 2025 in driving meaningful transformation within the industry depends on the synergistic approach of the Education, Higher Education, and Human Resource Ministries, he said.
 “A substantial allocation towards sustained TVET transformation is necessary to ensure that the goals set by the TVET councils are achieved,” he said, adding that more funds are needed to integrate digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI)-related skills into TVET.
 “This would modernise TVET, align it with future industry demands, and ensure that Malaysia’s workforce continues to be adaptable.
 “Emerging technologies, particularly AI, is important in ensuring that TVET graduates remain competitive,” he said, adding that by incorporating AI-related skills into TVET programmes, students can develop competencies that are highly sought after across industries. 
 “This not only boosts their employability but also equips Malaysia’s workforce to meet the demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),” he said.
 In the last budget, RM100mil was allocated to provide professional certification to TVET graduates and as an incentive for the industry to collaborate with public TVET institutions. 
 Budget 2025, he said, should allocate funds to set global standards for the sector. 
 “TVET programmes must be aligned with international standards to facilitate recognition of qualifications across borders, ensuring mobility for learners,” he said, adding that the country’s TVET graduates must be on par with their global counterparts.
 Prof Razali also recommended investing in more TVET programmes that encourage a wider demographic, from low income to high income communities to improve their skills and venture into new fields.
 This, he added, can have far-reaching benefits.
 “By offering TVET skills development to all economic segments, the initiative can promote upward mobility, and bridge the skills gap across different communities. Lower income groups would benefit from access to new job opportunities, while higher income communities can upskill or reskill to remain competitive in evolving industries,” he said.
 He also stressed on the importance of allocating funds to integrate sustainability practices into TVET programmes as this would be a step towards equipping students with the skills needed for emerging green jobs.
 This, he said, is in line with the Unesco-Unevoc vocational education vision on the development and implementation of green strategies to transform the learning and training environment of talents.
 “By embedding sustainability into TVET, students will be better prepared to contribute to eco-friendly industries, which are becoming important globally as economies shift toward more sustainable practices,” he said.
 National Association of Private Educational Institutions (Napei) president Assoc Prof Elajsolan Mohan said Budget 2025 should recognise TVET qualifications in the civil service.“This would inspire confidence in aspiring TVET talents and boost TVET enrolment by providing clearer career prospects in government jobs, particularly for students from underprivileged backgrounds,” he said.",continuous effort reform malaysia technical vocational education training tvet prof razali hassan universiti tun hussein onn malaysia faculty technical vocational education success budget meaningful transformation industry synergistic approach education education human resource ministry substantial allocation tvet transformation goal council fund integrate digital tool artificial intelligence skill modernise tvet align future industry malaysia workforce adaptable technology tvet graduate competitive skill programme student competency sought industry employability equips workforce meet demand fourth industrial revolution budget mil provide professional certification tvet incentive industry public tvet institution budget allocate fund global standard sector tvet programme international standard facilitate recognition qualification border mobility learner country tvet par global counterpart prof razali tvet programme wider demographic low income income community skill venture field benefit tvet skill development economic segment initiative upward mobility bridge skill gap community income benefit access job opportunity income community competitive industry fund integrate sustainability practice programme student skill green job unesco unevoc vocational education vision development implementation green strategy training environment talent sustainability tvet student contribute eco friendly industry economy sustainable practice national association private educational institution president assoc prof elajsolan budget recognise tvet qualification civil service inspire confidence tvet talent tvet enrolment clearer career prospect government job student background,"[(10, 0.9950603)]",10
739641,Main,14,12/10/2024,‘AI vital for economic growth’,Gobind: Enhancing talent pool imperative for nation’s development,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia must do more to build its talent pool in artificial intelligence (AI), says Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo.
 “There is a lot of positive sentiment at the moment and Malaysia’s digital economy is expected to contribute 25.5%, if not more, to the country’s GDP (gross domestic product) by the end of 2025.
 “All this bodes well for our country, but we cannot be complacent. We need to continue raising the bar in transforming Malaysia into a regional AI hub, and this includes establishing a skilled workforce to satisfy the growing demands of the tech industry,” he said at the opening of Malaysia’s first fully AI-based academy set up by Gamuda Bhd with the support of Google Cloud yesterday.
 He praised the collaboration between two giants, one in construction and the other in computing, for helping to fill the gap in Malaysia’s AI talent pool.
 Noting the extensive use of technology when Gamuda built the country’s first two MRT lines, now known as the Kajang and Putrajaya lines in Klang Valley, Gobind said he is excited that extensive digitalisation has been making waves in the construction industry – from autonomous tunnel-­boring machines to the use of digital twins in creating interactive virtual representations of physical buildings.
 “This is, however, only the tip of the iceberg. Modernising the workforce and keeping up with the latest developments is absolutely crucial to avoid falling behind,” he said.
 “Equipping our youths with the right skills, especially in this digital era, is also something our Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is very concerned about, as he has repeatedly called for more AI-related lessons and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) training in school and other learning institutions,” he said.
 On the academy, Gobind expressed hope that more of such partnerships will materialise in the near future.
 “Such public-private partnerships are pivotal to strengthening the digital ecosystem in Malaysia,” he said.
 In his speech, John Lim Ji Xiong, Gamuda’s group chief digital officer, said the academy’s mission is to equip individuals with hands-on AI development skills inspired by Gamuda’s track record of technical training and digital capabilities.
 “Through our long-standing partnership with Google Cloud, both companies have a common vision to grow the local talent pool to fully utilise the upcoming Google Malaysia data centres as announced by the Prime Minister on Oct 1,” he said.
 Serene Sia, Google Cloud’s country director for Malaysia and Singapore, said Google Cloud believes in making AI skills and tools more accessible to create a better future for Malaysia.
 “We can unlock growth opportunities and solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges. Gamuda has always been a pioneer in embracing technology to build MRT lines, tunnels, bridges, and expressways that benefit many Malaysians quickly while ensu­ring safety,” she said in her speech.
 “This academy represents their continued efforts to make a positive impact in Malaysia,  for Malaysians.” 
 Lim said in an interview that the extensive partnership with Google unlocks the full potential of cloud computing.
 “This synergy empowers Gamuda to pioneer innovative solutions across our projects, leveraging our deep industry expertise and Google’s cutting-edge technology. Together, we achieve more than the sum of our parts,” he said.
 The Gamuda AI Academy is inviting those aged from 21 to 40 to join its three-month-long boot camp that will equip students with the skills to take advantage of the future when many things are data-driven.
 It offers students a full-stack development course, giving them the chance to gain the knowledge necessary to create an AI application from beginning to end.
 The first intake in September attracted 42 students, ranging from fresh graduates in IT and engineering to mid-career professionals seeking to upskill, with the aim of eventually training around 1,500 students over the next five years.

737821,StarBiz,12,10/10/2024,OpenAI to focus on improving regional tie-ups,New office in island state to become second in Asia,"SINGAPORE: ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, the San Francisco-based company synonymous with bringing generative artificial intelligence (AI) into the spotlight, will open its second office in Asia in Singapore later in 2024.
 The Singapore office – the company’s fourth international branch – will focus on advancing regional collaboration, including work with national AI programme AI Singapore on generative AI models that are tuned to understand and reflect cultures and languages in South-East Asia.
 OpenAI’s expansion here signals the start-up’s long-term plans to tap Singapore’s growing pool of tech talent and deepen its roots in the region, acting as a hub for its Asia-Pacific (Apac) partners.
 Chief executive officer Sam Altman said in a statement yesterday: “Singapore, with its rich history of technology leadership, has emerged as a leader in AI, recognising its potential to solve some of society’s hardest problems and advance economic growth.
 “We’re excited to partner with the government and the country’s thriving AI ecosystem as we expand into the Apac region.”
 Altman, 39, last visited Singapore in June 2023 during a world tour to discuss AI-related issues and address concerns about the rapid roll-out of its signature product, ChatGPT, which brought generative AI into the mainstream.
 OpenAI, founded in 2015, has offices in London, Dublin and Tokyo. The location of its Singapore office is still being finalised.
 It will focus on supporting customers and partnerships with governments, businesses and institutions, said OpenAI.
 “These plans reflect Singapore’s leadership position in technology and AI, as well as the growing demand for advanced AI tools across Apac,” said OpenAI, which added that Singaporeans are among the highest-per-capita users of ChatGPT worldwide, with the number of weekly active users here doubling since the start of 2024.
 When asked, OpenAI confirmed that it plans to hire between five and 10 employees before 2025, for roles related to sales, security and solutions engineering, among others, and is committed to hiring local talent.
 Its regional operations will be led by Oliver Jay, who will serve as managing director of international operations and will be based here. Jay was previously chief revenue officer at software company Asana and an independent board director at Grab.
 The firm will work more closely with Singapore government partners, such as the Economic Development Board (EDB), to support AI development here.
 OpenAI added: “Establishing a regional presence brings OpenAI closer to innovative local companies, such as Grab in Singapore and Canva in Australia, which are using OpenAI’s advanced AI products to power new tools and features for their customers.”
 With that, OpenAI aims to make advanced AI more accessible in South-east Asia and will provide up to US$1mil to develop resources to ensure AI models that reflect the region’s diverse languages and cultures under a new partnership with AI Singapore.
 As an agency tasked with driving the growth of the technology here, AI Singapore is developing Sea-Lion, a network of ChatGPT-like large language models that are specifically trained for South-East Asian users to ensure that there is an AI that captures the region’s cultures.
 Since OpenAI made ChatGPT public in 2022, its presence in Singapore has expanded quickly, with its technology being integrated into AI solutions used by both businesses and the government, including customer service chatbots and an internal AI assistant for civil servants, Pair.
 AI models by Google Cloud and Meta have also entered the fray and are among the systems that are being tested by the authorities here in various projects.
 EDB managing director Jacqueline Poh said OpenAI’s entry is a sign of the strength of the city-state’s growing AI ecosystem, investments in AI talent, computation and demand from businesses.
 OpenAI’s operations here are likely to help spark new collaborations across the sector, she added. — The Straits Times/ANN",singapore chatgpt maker san francisco company synonymous generative artificial intelligence spotlight office asia singapore office company fourth international branch focus regional collaboration national programme generative model reflect culture south east asia openai expansion signal term plan pool tech talent deepen root region hub asia pacific partner chief executive officer altman statement yesterday rich history technology leadership leader potential solve society hardest advance economic growth partner government country ecosystem apac region altman singapore june tour issue address concern rapid roll signature product chatgpt generative mainstream openai office london dublin tokyo location singapore office focus customer partnership government business institution plan leadership position technology demand tool openai singaporean user worldwide active user start openai plan employee role sale security solution engineering local talent regional operation jay director international operation jay chief revenue officer software company independent board director firm singapore government partner economic development board support development regional presence brings innovative local company canva australia product power tool customer aim accessible south east asia mil resource model region diverse culture partnership singapore agency growth technology sea lion network chatgpt language model south east asian user capture region culture chatgpt public presence singapore technology solution business government customer service chatbots internal assistant civil servant pair model cloud meta fray system authority project director jacqueline poh openai entry sign strength city ecosystem investment talent computation demand business operation collaboration sector time,"[(8, 0.22534305), (10, 0.39250574), (14, 0.3785134)]",10

 The Clove is a cluster of eight homes, consisting of four corner units and four intermediate units arranged around a gated communal garden, shared exclusively among the eight homes.
 Each unit will feature a private garden and offer spacious built-up areas ranging from 1,950 sq ft to 2,210 sq ft, with an indicative starting price from RM750,000.
 A new era of digital  customisation
 Gamuda’s groundbreaking customisation portal harnesses the power of Gen AI to offer homebuyers flexible options for personalisation, allowing them to design their dream homes with ease, reshaping the entire journey from selection to moving-in.
 The initiative is part of Gamuda’s “Trifecta of Innovations”, which encompasses digital innovation, design innovation and its in-house next-gen digital industrialised building system (IBS).
 This integrated approach is a hallmark of Gamuda Group, made possible through the collaboration of its property development, construction and digitalisation arms. 
 All design and digital innovations are conceptualised and developed in-house by dedicated specialised teams, ensuring a seamless integration of cutting-edge technology and design excellence.
 Gamuda Bhd group chief digital officer John Lim Ji Xiong explains that the company aims to reinvent the customer experience by allowing them to tailor The Clove to their preferences.
 “It’s all about driving the whole customisation experience for customers. 
 “With the GL Connect Portal, customers can make decisions on what they want their homes to look like from the very start of the homebuying journey – with the click of a button – by simply interacting with the AI,” says Lim.
 Lim shares that the portal was developed in-house using Google’s Gemini Pro multimodal language model, as part of Gamuda’s strategic partnership with Google Cloud.
 This enables the AI on the portal to converse in three languages (English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese), with speech-to-text functionality.
 “Sometimes, customers need more time to decide on what type of design or layout they want, instead of feeling pressured to make quick decisions at a sales gallery.
 “By using this portal, every homeowner has the freedom to choose what they want, at their own pace,” he adds.
 Lim says that with the power of AI, the company can break past the limitations of traditional home buying, as the AI can chat with customers, discuss and even recommend their ideal home based on their requests. There will be no additional charges for homes customisations. 
 Lim adds that the digital environment of the portal also aids in reducing errors when it comes to the construction phase of development, as all design information is recorded and shared with contractors via a cloud-based system.
 Reimagining home: Sustainable living for the futureBeyond these innovative features, The Clove exemplifies Gamuda Land’s commitment to sustainable living. 
 These homes come equipped with solar panel readiness, featuring reinforced roofs with built-in isolators as well as electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. 
 This integration of modern sustainable design principles is just the beginning of what Gamuda Land envisions for the future of living spaces.
 Gamuda Land chief operating officer Jess Teng Poh Fern, emphasises the company’s dedication to environmental responsibility, stating: “We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint, and our next-gen digital IBS technology plays a crucial role in this. 
 “By minimising construction waste and enhancing efficiency, we ensure quicker delivery times without sacrificing quality.” 
 This focus on innovation not only meets today’s needs but also future-proofs the homes for generations to come. 
 Understanding the diverse needs of busy professionals and young families, Gamuda Land aims to create vibrant, sustainable communities. 
 “We strive to simplify the transition to sustainable living for our residents. That’s why we offer options for customers to enhance their homes with green and smart features, such as EV charging stations, solar panels and Samsung Smart Home devices, all accessible through our GL Connect portal,” Teng explains. 
 She noted that the portal also offers an interior design option, further enhancing convenience for homebuyers.
 “This empowers families to embrace a sustainable lifestyle from day one. 
 “Once customers have made their selections, they’ll be guided to a summary page that outlines their chosen customisations and packages. 
 “After confirming their order, they simply need to schedule an appointment with one of our relationship associates at our Experience Galleries to finalise their booking,” she adds.
 The home customisation portal will be publicly accessible on Gamuda Land’s website on Oct 15, allowing anyone to explore the innovative features of Gen AI.
 The Clove is set to debut in three of Gamuda Land’s thriving satellite townships in the Klang Valley: Gamuda Cove (Kuala Langat), Gamuda Gardens (Sungai Buloh North) and The Clove Signature series at twentyfive7 (South of Kota Kemuning). 
 The Clove Signature series will feature premium fittings and is located within a well-established township, providing residents with convenient access to amenities at the popular Quayside Mall.

736643,Lifestyle,5,07/10/2024,Weathering       the storm with            AI,Extreme weather is taxing utilities in the United States more often. How can artificial intelligence help?,"More than four million people were without power on a Friday morning on Sept 27 after the enormous ring of wind and rain known as Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida, United States, and moved north.
 It is the latest storm to show utility companies’ increasing vulnerability to extreme weather events that are becoming more common and more intense under climate change.
 “There are a lot of different signs of climate-related weather risks to infrastructure,” said Catie Hausman, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. Those risks include hurricanes and flooding, wildfires, heat waves and increased tornado risks or cold snaps in regions less used to them.
 Extreme weather has increasingly strained the grid, and it is the No 1 cause of major power outages in the United States. In some areas of the country, the risk of hurricane-induced power outages could become 50% higher in the coming decades as such storms get stronger.
 Wind and rain are the dominant factors that can strain power grids, said Andrea Staid, a researcher in energy systems and climate analysis at the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.
 The institute’s models show that as more hurricanes affect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, more power outages will occur if the grid does not change.
 “Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem,” Staid said. “Our models show that these storms can travel pretty far inland with strong winds, so we need to make sure people and communities have the information and resources needed to prepare.”
 Now, in an effort to better predict what storms are coming and how to transition out of a fossil-dependent grid, utilities are looking to a new generation of technologies driven by artificial intelligence (AI).
 Hausman said that while she did not know whether AI was the right way to harden the grid, modern data and computing were needed to understand the problems.
 “Whether AI is giving us something new or a black box of mush is going to depend on the company and the tools they’re using,” Hausman said.
 What is clear? Utilities need to spend a lot of money to update their power systems to deal with storms both present and future.
 “We’re still thinking of the grid as we have for the past 100 years, and it’s increasingly obvious that needs to change,” said Mark Dyson, managing director of the carbon-free electricity programme at the global research firm Rocky Mountain Institute.
 “Extreme weather, ageing infrastructure and new technology are coming together in a way that creates an opportunity to use better technology, including AI-driven software, to help us keep the lights on and keep the grid affordable,” Dyson said.
 One of the newest players in the nascent industry is Rhizome, a company founded in 2022 that uses AI-driven technology to help electric utilities identify and plan for vulnerabilities that could cause power failures.
 “Rhizome’s AI platform approach is to fundamentally understand the relationships between hurricane conditions and grid impacts,” said Mishal Thadani, Rhizome’s co-founder. 
 The company’s data points from thousands of hurricane-related asset failures and what caused them can show utilities their long-term risks from hurricanes, helping them figure out where to harden poles, move power lines underground or cut vegetation.
 “Ultimately, we’re able to project how many future potential hurricane-related outages will be reduced per dollar of utility investment,” Thadani said.
 Figuring out how to harden the grid and expand the country’s transmission network could lower costs to consumers, bring more renewables online and reduce power outages, Hausman said.
 Most utilities are already using some   machine learning or AI technology, said Booga Gilbertson, a former utility executive and an investor in Rhizome. Right now, the flashy types of AI programming are language models like ChatGPT from Microsoft or Gemini from Google. Machine learning has been combing through a mind-boggling amount of data for more than a decade, Gilbertson said.
 “It seems like once a month there’s a new entrant into this space,” she said. “Products like this are relatively new to the market, and the advent of AI and computing power have made them more available. It’s a tool utilities can now put into their tool chest.”
 AI is also a known energy hog, and could ramp up the nation’s electricity demand by as much as 20% by the end of the decade. But the US, like other global powers, wants to lead the world in AI. In September, the White House convened a group of utilities, AI companies and data centre operators to strategise for the future.
 As the country’s transmission system struggles beneath the weight of growing electrification and a changing generation mix, the growing set of AI-driven products could potentially pivot AI’s bad climate reputation.
 “I suspect that the amount of energy we would spend more than pays for itself in terms of maintaining an affordable and reliable grid,” Dyson said. “But the data to support that suspicion doesn’t exist yet. The industry is so immature we don’t have an outlook yet for the types of sectors that would be most advantaged from AI.”
 As new companies enter the space, AI climate modelling is still a bit of a Wild West.
 Andre Coleman, chief scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, leads a team that developed a program called RADR-Fire to build risk prediction models for wildfires. He said such models are also available for other hazardous events like tropical cyclones, extreme rain and extreme heat, extending as far into the future as 2100.
 “Particularly when we’re talking about assessing risk around disaster events, we have to be really, really sure about what those machine-learning models are doing, especially for unique or outlier events,” Coleman said.
 Coleman wants cooperation to make sure the methods and models are the same, then make all that data accessible, especially for smaller utilities with fewer resources, like rural cooperatives.
 “You end up with this huge mosaic of people who are doing this kind of risk modelling using all kinds of different data sets; some are appropriate, others aren’t,” he said. “Those are the things that concern me a lot.” – The New York Times",people power friday morning sept enormous ring wind rain hurricane helene landfall florida north storm utility company vulnerability extreme weather event common intense climate change lot sign weather risk infrastructure hausman public policy university michigan risk hurricane wildfire heat wave tornado risk cold snap region grid major power outage united country risk hurricane power outage decade storm stronger wind rain dominant factor power grid andrea researcher energy system analysis nonprofit electric power institute institute model hurricane gulf atlantic coast power outage grid change hurricane coastal staid model storm strong wind people community resource effort predict storm transition fossil dependent grid utility generation technology artificial intelligence hausman harden grid modern data understand black box mush company hausman utility lot money update power system deal future grid obvious change mark dyson director carbon free electricity programme global firm institute extreme weather infrastructure technology creates opportunity technology software light affordable dyson player nascent industry company driven technology electric utility plan vulnerability power rhizome platform approach understand relationship hurricane condition impact mishal thadani rhizome founder company thousand hurricane asset failure utility term risk hurricane figure harden pole power line cut vegetation project future potential hurricane outage dollar utility investment thadani harden grid expand country transmission network cost consumer renewables power outage hausman utility machine technology booga gilbertson utility executive investor rhizome flashy type language model microsoft gemini google machine mind boggling amount data decade gilbertson month entrant space product market advent power tool utility chest energy hog ramp nation electricity demand decade global power september white house utility company data centre operator future country transmission system weight electrification generation set product pivot bad climate reputation suspect amount energy pay term affordable reliable grid dyson data support suspicion industry immature outlook sector company space climate bit wild west andre coleman chief scientist pacific northwest national laboratory team program radr fire build risk prediction model model hazardous event tropical cyclone extreme extreme heat future risk disaster event machine model unique outlier event coleman coleman cooperation method model data accessible utility fewer resource rural cooperative huge mosaic people kind data set concern lot york time,"[(14, 0.99721164)]",14
736287,StarBiz 7,16,05/10/2024,Pragmatic AI and cloud computing policy needed,,"THE government’s national cloud computing policy plan is necessary to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) even though it means adding yet another layer of regulations.
 Chaos will ensue if AI is not regulated. As for cloud computing, there are issues of mandating the localisation of storage and its data protection.
 In all of this, the focus should be on enhancing governance and ensuring fair and proper execution of the rules.
 One fear, especially going by experiences in Malaysia, is that business activity is unfairly stymied by new levels of approval that not only cause delays in running businesses but also result in additional costs. 
 Another concern is government IT procurement. Suppose the new rules require the government to use more AI and cloud computing, then it must procure this technology at the lowest possible price and not through “crony” companies.
 After all, one of the many promises of the unity government is to stop unnecessary spending on external consultants and other areas. 
 There have been far too many instances of outsourcing tasks to the private sector through so-called public-private partnerships. Most of the time, private sector parties have had the advantage of less risk and more benefits.
 That said, governments do face the challenge of developing in-house AI capabilities due to a lack of talent and resources. So sometimes it needs to engage external parties to help and it can be cost-effective. 
 If the government chooses that route, it would do itself good by explaining why a particular company was chosen, its track record and how cost-effective the service is going to be.
 AI regulations ought to also provide guidelines on how the government machinery should use AI to enhance the delivery of public services. It should not result in more complexities and additional costs for users. The privacy of users also needs to be protected.
 Then there is the issue of AI for the private sector. Most companies do not know what they should do with cloud services and AI. The fear is that AI could disrupt their businesses. 
 Hence, a well-designed AI regulatory framework should pave the way for private companies to adopt AI in a responsible way. There needs to be a balance between oversight and innovation.
 For regulation of cloud services, new rules need to focus on sustainable practices within the data centre industry, which is booming at a significant rate in Malaysia and considering the vast amounts of energy they consume. 
 The regulatory framework should enforce strict licensing on data centres which must adhere to sustainable energy usage, proof of local content and employment and also local data protection and cybersecurity rules.
 Assoc Prof Dr Selvakumar Manickam of Universiti Sains Malaysia gives his wishlist for what should be in the cloud and AI regulations. In summary: 
 l It must ensure data sovereignty by mandating local data storage, as seen in the case of TikTok in the United States, where concerns about the app’s data practices raised significant national security issues. 
 l Cloud service providers must ensure compliance to Malaysian cyber laws, such as the Malaysian Cybersecurity Act (Act 854) in addition to global cybersecurity standards. 
 l The new AI and cloud policies should also ensure that local talent development is mandatory, equipping Malaysians with the necessary cloud-related skills to support the country’s digital transformation. 
 l Mandating sustainable and green practices by cloud data centres.
 l Mandating risk assessments to prevent AI-related hazards, especially in critical sectors like healthcare and energy, while also ensuring human oversight and accountability in AI decisions. 
 l AI should be used as a decision-support tool and not as a decision-making tool. Since AI relies heavily on vast amounts of data, regulations must include strict measures for how this data is gathered, stored and used. This is especially important to safeguard personal information and ensure responsible AI development. 
 l This includes complying with national and international data protection laws. Regular audits and an oversight body are also essential to ensure compliance and responsible AI development. Many of the regulations and policies for both cloud and AI are intertwined as the data storage and AI engine are provided by the cloud, in many cases.
 l Since cloud technology is often the backbone for AI systems, particularly for data storage and processing, regulations will need to address both areas in a coordinated way. This will ensure responsible and ethical AI development within a secure cloud environment.",government national cloud policy plan artificial intelligence layer regulation ensue cloud issue localisation storage data protection focus governance fair proper execution rule experience malaysia business activity level approval business additional cost concern government procurement suppose rule government cloud procure technology lowest price crony company unity government unnecessary spending external consultant instance task private sector public private partnership time private sector party risk benefit government house capability talent resource external party effective government chooses company track record cost effective service regulation guideline government machinery delivery public service result complexity additional cost user user issue private sector company service fear disrupt business regulatory framework private company responsible balance oversight innovation regulation cloud service rule sustainable practice data centre industry rate malaysia vast amount energy regulatory framework enforce strict licensing data centre sustainable energy usage proof local content employment local data protection cybersecurity rule prof selvakumar manickam universiti sains malaysia wishlist cloud regulation summary data local data storage tiktok united concern data practice national security issue service provider compliance malaysian cyber law malaysian cybersecurity addition global cybersecurity standard cloud policy local talent development mandatory malaysian skill support country digital transformation sustainable green practice data centre risk assessment hazard critical sector energy human oversight accountability decision decision support tool decision tool relies vast amount data regulation strict measure data stored safeguard personal responsible development national international data protection law regular audit essential compliance responsible development regulation policy data storage engine cloud cloud technology backbone system data storage processing regulation responsible ethical development secure cloud environment,"[(10, 0.6255919), (13, 0.30488697), (14, 0.06631952)]",10
736295,StarBiz 7,28,05/10/2024,Will AI boost growth in Asia?,,"THERE is much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) and technology sparking off a revival of growth globally. How far is that true?
 In recent years, growth everywhere has slowed down due to productivity declines, in spite of the Internet and computer revolution. 
 As Nobel Laureate economist Robert Solow said in 1987: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in productivity statistics”. 
 From 1996 to 2005, US labour productivity growth averaged 2.62%, but slowed to 1% from 2006 to 2017. This trend cuts across different countries and has different reasons, such as financial crises, capital deepening, trade and mismeasurement factors.
 When AI arrived with a ChatGPT bang, everyone thought this was the biggest productivity innovation since the internet - we could write research theses to poems in seconds. 
 In a recent essay on the macroeconomics of AI, Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Gabriel Unger argued that AI could developed in three different forks (good or bad), namely through productivity growth, income inequality and industrial concentration. 
 Without a proper set of policies and regulations, we may end up with the worst of three worlds – low productivity, worse income inequality and huge power concentration.   On the other hand, with the right set of policies, an emerging and developing market economy could end up with higher productivity, more inclusivity and less market concentration.  
 It takes a lot of market size and talent to achieve leadership in AI and technology.   The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) recently published a paper tracking 64 core technologies using cited research papers, which showed that the leading position of United States and China have reversed in the last five years (2019-2023), with India in third place, although Europe as a group is third, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. India is strong because she has one of the largest cohort of STEM graduates coming into her workforce.  
 Although the ASPI study is basically a desktop study of cited and published academic papers, the mainstream view is that China is undisputedly in the lead in the core manufacturing area, but the United States and her Western allies remain better in the cutting edge technology areas. 
 However, China’s ability to catch up on the latest five nanometer semiconductor chips may be as short as three years behind TSMC technology.  Clearly, attempts to constrain China through technology sanctions and restrictions to access from cutting edge technology only spur her to invest even more heavily in developing domestic technology. 
 For the Great Powers, cost seems to be less of a concern where national security is concerned.  
 It is estimated that the cost of building a top-of-the-line semiconductor fabrication plant has soared from US$400mil for a 65 nm chip in 2006 to US$5.4bil by 2020. McKinsey has shown that the top 10 in the semiconductor field account for the bulk of revenue and investments, demonstrating that technology (including AI) is highly concentrated and indeed generates income inequality.
 Most would agree that governments should do as much as possible to narrow the digital divide by introducing mass digital and re-skilling education.  Indeed, one of the fields where AI can excel is to help students learn much faster, using an AI bot as a teaching assistant.    
 The first set of persons to be trained in using and applying AI should be civil servants, because government processes lie at the heart of almost all business and social transactions. 
 The private sector can innovate all it wants but its productivity will stop at the first bureaucratic red tape. Hence, system productivity cannot be increased without first increasing government productivity. 
 Professor Brynjolfsson has argued that getting to the “better forks” is good policy, and would include creative policy experiments, a set of positive goals for what society wants from AI, and understanding that technology brings uncertainties in outcomes, so flexibility in implementation is critical.
 Herein lies the common pattern to why productivity cannot progress in more complex societies. 
 As businesses grow more sophisticated, laws and regulations rise in number and complexity, with often patchy enforcement, so that only the large or rich can afford the lawyers to manoeuvre around the bureaucratic swamp.  
 Corruption is encouraged where laws proliferate with little transparency as to enforcement or outcomes.  
 In less sophisticated communities which live close to each other, everyone shares and cooperates to build social well-being, such as digging wells, maintaining the commons, and solving problems through consensus. 
 Using Nobel Laureate Edmund Phelps’ expression, mass flourishing requires mass grassroots cooperation. You cannot delegate this just to civil servants. 
 Just as teaching children digital skills require teaching the teachers first, we must teach the civil servants first by working with them to solve mutual problems. This is not about getting consultants to teach the civil servants, but getting the private sector to work with the civil servants in real live cases on how to improve state-market processes, such as licensing, compliance issues and actual policy outcomes and objectives.
 All too often, in a world of delegation to experts or specialists, policies, rules and regulations have been passed with their original intention or objectives forgotten. 
 The result is many laws exist that few understand, and are often obsolete. AI could identify cases of artificial stupidity (often unintended) that actually create waste and frustration. 
 I often wonder whether traffic lights that are mechanically operated can be easily replaced by smart CCTV cameras that can calibrate traffic and avoid huge waste of fuel and time in massive traffic jams.  
 We need to work together to solve our mutual problems.  Working together using AI may be a good start.",hype artificial intelligence technology revival growth true growth productivity decline computer revolution nobel laureate economist robert computer age productivity statistic productivity growth trend cut country reason financial crisis capital trade mismeasurement factor chatgpt bang biggest productivity innovation internet write thesis macroeconomics stanford economist brynjolfsson gabriel unger fork bad productivity growth income inequality industrial concentration proper policy regulation world low productivity worse income inequality huge power concentration hand policy market economy productivity inclusivity market concentration lot market size talent leadership technology australian strategic policy institute aspi paper core technology paper position united china india europe kingdom japan korea india strong largest cohort stem workforce aspi study study academic paper mainstream view lead core manufacturing united western ally edge technology china ability semiconductor chip short tsmc technology attempt china technology sanction restriction access edge technology invest domestic technology power concern national security cost building top semiconductor fabrication plant mil chip bil mckinsey top semiconductor field account bulk revenue investment technology concentrated generates income inequality agree government narrow digital divide mass digital education field excel student faster assistant person civil servant government lie heart business social transaction private sector productivity bureaucratic red tape system productivity government productivity professor brynjolfsson fork policy creative policy experiment positive goal society technology brings uncertainty flexibility implementation critical common pattern productivity progress complex society business sophisticated law regulation complexity patchy enforcement rich afford lawyer bureaucratic swamp corruption law proliferate transparency enforcement sophisticated community close share social digging common consensus nobel laureate edmund expression mass mass grassroots cooperation civil servant child digital skill teacher civil servant mutual consultant civil servant private sector civil servant real live improve market compliance issue actual policy delegation expert specialist policy rule regulation original intention objective result law understand obsolete artificial stupidity unintended create waste frustration traffic light smart cctv camera traffic avoid huge waste fuel time massive traffic jam mutual start,"[(1, 0.1787168), (8, 0.42528015), (9, 0.27918538), (13, 0.11431243)]",8

 In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Cerebras disclosed that its sales increased to US$136.4mil in the first six months of the year, up from US$8.7mil in the period a year earlier. 
 Cerebras had previously filed confidentially for the IPO in August. 
 The Sunnyvale, California-based firm recorded a net loss of US$66.6mil in the six-month period, compared with a net loss of US$77.8mil a year earlier, the filing showed. 
 It also revealed that it depends on Abu Dhabi’s Group 42 Holding Ltd (G42), an AI company, for most of its revenue.
 The filing depicts a company still in the early stages of taking on Nvidia and other established chipmakers, but it looks to gain an edge with a different approach. 
 CS-3, Cerebras’ flagship system, is optimised to handle AI computing workloads and can be clustered together to power AI supercomputers.
 Founder and chief executive officer Andrew Feldman said his firm’s chips, and the computing systems equipped with them, will upend the AI computing industry. 
 So far, the 10s of billions of dollars poured into running AI models and generating responses have mostly flowed to Nvidia’s graphics processing units.
 Cerebras and the selling shareholders won’t disclose proposed terms for the share sale, including the company’s valuation in a listing, until a later filing. 
 A listing could raise as much as US$1bil at a US$7bil to US$8bil value, Bloomberg News has reported.

734544,Main,7,01/10/2024,AI already transforming jobs today,"Its advent is poised to have varying impacts in different sectors, says Sim","KUALA LUMPUR: Approxi­mate­ly 16% of the 97 job roles in the financial sector are expected to be significantly transformed by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), says Human Resources Minis­ter Steven Sim.
 “We are looking at roles such as customer service officers, investment advisory and execution analysts, direct sales agents, product sales officers, relationship managers, business development man­a­gers, credit and lending offi­cers, investment operations as well as security service officers.
 “Three quarters (75%) of roles will experience medium to low impact, while about 9% will be emerging roles, which are not commonly seen in the sector currently but will gain prominence soon.
 “These emerging roles include machine learning specialists, integration architects, cloud engineers, digital transformation and adoption analysts, community part­nership advisers, and sustai­nability and employee well-being officers,” he said during his speech at the launch of the National Human Capital Conference and Exhibition (NHCCE) 2024 held by the Human Resource Develop­ment Corporation (HRD Corp) here yesterday.
 According to Sim, in the ICT sector, 8% of current roles will be highly impacted, including security operation analysts, data analysts, application support engineers, data centre infrastructure engineers, network engineers, IT auditors and cyber risk analysts.
 “Emerging skills in this sector include emerging technology synthesis, automation management, test planning, IT strategy and solu­tion architecture,” he added.
 Sim also highlighted the use of AI technology in providing recom­mendations for grant applications and claims submitted by emplo­yers or training providers based on preset logic and criteria.
 “AI will analyse the provided information and documents, and suggest whether the application should be approved or rejected, or if additional information is required,” he explained.
 Sim shared an example of the benefit of using AI, stating that it had helped reduce the grant appli­cation processing time at HRD Corp from 154 hours in 2022 (with 239,776 applications processed) to 19 hours in 2023 (with 359,170 applications processed).
 “Another example is in the Social Security Organisation (Socso), where we issue guarantee letters (GLs) to our contributors, provided for free for those needing implants for rehabilitation.

734040,StarBiz,10,30/09/2024,"If AI seems smarter​, it’s thanks to smarter humans","Companies hiring physicians, analysts and accountants","STOCKHOLM: In the early years, getting artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT or its rival Cohere to spit out human-like responses required vast teams of low-cost workers helping models distinguish basic facts such as if an image was of a car or a carrot.
 But more sophisticated updates to AI models in the fiercely competitive arena are now demanding a rapidly expanding network of human trainers who have specialised knowledge – from historians to scientists, some with doctorate degrees. 
 “A year ago, we could get away with hiring undergraduates, to just generally teach AI on how to improve,” said Cohere co-founder Ivan Zhang, talking about its internal human trainers.
 “Now we have licensed physicians teaching the models how to behave in medical environments, or financial analysts or accountants,” Zhang said. 
 For more training, Cohere, which was last valued at over US$5bil, works with a startup called Invisible Tech. 
 Cohere is one of the main rivals of OpenAI and specialises in AI for businesses. The startup Invisible Tech employs thousands of trainers, working remotely, and has become one of the main partners of AI companies ranging from AI21 to Microsoft to train their AI models to reduce errors, known in the AI world as hallucinations.
 “We have 5,000 people in over 100 countries around the world that are PhDs, Master’s degree holders and knowledge-work specialists,” said Invisible founder Francis Pedraza.
 Invisible pays as much as US$40 per hour, depending on the location of the worker and the complexity of work. 
 Some companies such as Outlier pay up to US$50 per hour, while another company called Labelbox said it pays up to US$200 per hour for “high expertise” subjects like quantum physics, but starts with US$15 for basic topics. 
 Invisible was founded in 2015 as a workflow-automation company catering to the likes of food delivery company DoorDash to digitise their delivery menu. 
 But things changed when a relatively unknown research firm called OpenAI contacted them in the spring of 2022, ahead of the public launch of ChatGPT.
 “OpenAI came to us with a problem, which is that when you were asking an early version of ChatGPT a question, it was going to hallucinate. You couldn’t trust the answer,” Pedraza told Reuters.
 “They needed an advanced AI training partner to provide reinforcement learning with human feedback,” Pedraza said.
 OpenAI did not respond to request for comment. Generative AI (GenAI) produces new content based on past data used to train it. 
 However, sometimes it can’t distinguish between true and false information and generates false outputs known as hallucinations. 
 In one notable example, in 2023 a Google chatbot shared inaccurate information about which satellite first took pictures of a planet outside the Earth’s solar system in a promotional video.
 Hallucination problem
 AI companies are aware that hallucinations can derail GenAI’s attractiveness to businesses and are trying various ways to reduce it, including using human trainers to teach the concept of fact and fiction. 
 Since getting onboard with OpenAI, Invisible said it had become AI training partners to most of the GenAI companies, including Cohere, AI21 and Microsoft. Cohere and AI21 confirmed they are clients. Microsoft did not confirm it is a client of Invisible.
 “These are all companies that had training challenges, where their number one cost was compute power, and then the number two cost is quality training,” Pedraza said.
 OpenAI, which started off the frenzy around GenAI, has a team of researchers aptly named “Human Data Team” that works with AI trainers to gather specialised data for training its models like ChatGPT.
 OpenAI researchers come up with various experiments like reducing hallucinations or to improve writing style and work with AI trainers from Invisible and other vendors, a source familiar with the company’s processes said.
 At any point, dozens of experiments are being run, some with tools developed by OpenAI and others by tools of vendors, the person said.
 Based on what the AI companies want – from getting better at Swedish history or doing financial modelling – Invisible hires workers with relevant degrees for those projects, reducing the burden of managing hundreds of trainers by the AI companies. 
 “OpenAI has some of the most incredible computer scientists in the world but they’re not necessarily an expert in Swedish history or chemistry questions or biology questions or anything you can ask it,” Pedraza said, adding that over 1,000 contract workers cater to OpenAI alone.
 Cohere’s Zhang said he has personally used Invisible’s trainers to find a way to teach its GenAI model to find relevant information from a big data set.
 Competition
 Among the competitors in this space is Scale AI, a private start-up last valued at US$14bil which provides AI companies with sets of training data. 
 It has also ventured into the area of providing AI trainers, and counts OpenAI as a customer. 
 Scale AI did not respond to requests for an interview for this story. 
 Invisible, which has been profitable since 2021, has raised only US$8mil of primary capital. 
 “We are 70% owned by the team, and only 30% owned by investors,” Pedraza said. “We do facilitate secondary rounds, and the most recent traded price was at a half a billion US dollar valuation,” he added.
 Reuters could not confirm that valuation. 
 Human trainers first got into AI training through data-labelling work that required less qualification and was also paid less, sometimes as low as US$2, mostly done by people in African and Asian countries.
 As AI companies launch more advanced models, the demand for specialised trainers and across dozens of languages is on the rise, creating a well-paid niche where workers from a variety of subjects could become AI trainers without even knowing how to code.
 Demand from AI companies is leading to the creation of more companies that are offering similar services. — Reuters",stockholm artificial intelligence model rival cohere spit human response vast team low cost worker model distinguish basic image car carrot update model competitive arena network human trainer knowledge historian scientist degree undergraduate cohere founder ivan zhang internal human trainer physician model medical environment financial analyst accountant bil startup invisible tech main rival specialises business invisible tech thousand trainer main partner company microsoft train model error hallucination people country master degree holder specialist invisible founder francis pedraza invisible pay hour location worker complexity company hour company labelbox pay hour expertise quantum physic start basic topic invisible workflow automation company like food delivery company doordash digitise delivery menu unknown firm spring public launch chatgpt openai version chatgpt question hallucinate trust answer pedraza reuters training partner reinforcement human feedback pedraza respond request comment generative genai content data distinguish true false generates false output hallucination notable google chatbot inaccurate satellite picture earth solar system promotional video hallucination company aware hallucination genai attractiveness business human trainer concept fiction openai invisible partner genai company cohere microsoft cohere client microsoft client invisible company challenge compute power cost quality pedraza openai frenzy genai team researcher human data team trainer data training model openai researcher experiment hallucination style trainer invisible vendor source familiar company dozen experiment tool openai tool vendor person company swedish history financial invisible hire worker degree project burden hundred trainer company incredible computer scientist swedish history chemistry question question contract worker zhang invisible trainer genai model relevant data competition competitor space scale private start bil company data trainer count customer scale respond request interview story invisible profitable mil primary capital team investor pedraza facilitate secondary round price half dollar valuation reuters valuation human trainer data labelling qualification low people african asian country company advanced model trainer dozen language niche worker variety subject trainer code demand company creation company service reuters,"[(5, 0.54070854), (6, 0.45634204)]",5
734150,Main,7,30/09/2024,"Tap into AI technologies from China, urges Fahmi",,"BEIJING: Malaysia can explore and leverage emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies from China to suit conditions in Malaysia, says Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil (pic).
 During his working visit to China, he said these technologies are suitable for use in the telecommunications, media, broadcasting and film sectors.
 “I see many opportunities that we should explore and take advantage of, such as the opportunity to learn, observe, share experiences and adopt what we deem appropriate for Malaysia.
 “I find the technological aspects most intriguing because we came with an understanding of the challenges we face, and these could be some of the solutions we can benefit from,” he told Bernama.
 Fahmi, who arrived here on Sept 26, concluded his working visit yesterday and departed for South Korea to attend the GSMA Mobile 360 APAC conference.
 Citing an example, Fahmi said the joint-venture agreement between Altel and Geespace on satellite technology, particularly direct-to-cell technology, could provide an ideal solution to improve connectivity in remote areas.
 Additionally, Fahmi highlighted that real-time translation technology could also be utilised, particularly in the film industry, to attract a larger audience that speaks different languages. 
 His visit to China Media Group, a pioneer in 8K ultra-high-definition broad­casting, also offered new insights into broadcasting technology and how AI could be leveraged for production purposes.
 Fahmi said he observed many potential opportunities, such as creating exportable content to China, including micro-dramas under one minute in length, which are increasingly popular in the country.
 In this connection, he encouraged media agencies, particularly Radio Television Malaysia, the Malaysian National News Agency and the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia to accelerate content creation and reporting to promote the uniqueness of Malaysia and attract tourists from China. 
 While in China, Fahmi held bilateral meetings with China’s National Radio and Television Administration Minister Cao Shumin as well as Industry and Information Technology Minister Jin Zhuanglong.
 During his meeting with Cao, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for cooperation in media and broadcasting, involving the exchange of tourism, food, culture and economic content.
 Fahmi also witnessed the signing of an MOU between a Malaysian mobile network operator and a Chinese telecommunications company, aiming to provide comprehensive technological solutions such as fast mobile coverage through 5G networks.",malaysia leverage artificial intelligence technology suit condition communication minister fadzil pic visit china technology suitable telecommunication medium film sector opportunity advantage opportunity share experience deem malaysia technological aspect understanding challenge solution told bernama fahmi visit yesterday south korea attend gsma mobile apac conference fahmi joint venture agreement altel geespace satellite technology direct cell technology ideal solution connectivity real time translation technology utilised film industry attract larger audience speaks china medium pioneer ultra definition broad casting insight technology leveraged production purpose potential opportunity exportable content china micro drama minute length popular country connection medium agency television malaysia malaysian national news agency national film development corporation malaysia accelerate content creation promote uniqueness malaysia attract tourist china fahmi bilateral meeting national radio television administration minister shumin industry technology minister jin meeting cao party memorandum mou cooperation medium exchange tourism food culture economic content fahmi mou malaysian mobile network operator chinese telecommunication company comprehensive technological solution mobile coverage network,"[(10, 0.9938167)]",10
732798,StarMetro,4,27/09/2024,AI hub to help S’gor SMEs,State government to build facility with cloud partners,"AN Artificial Intelligence (AI) centre will be set up in Selangor to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) embrace the technology.
 The move will be under the state’s 2025 budget, said Selangor Islamic and cultural innovation committee chairman Dr Mohammad Fahmi Ngah.
 Speaking at the Selangor 2025 Budget dialogue session, he said the AI infrastructure centre would be built in collaboration with cloud partners.
 The dialogue session was launched by Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari, where five group discussions took place simultaneously.
 The topics were AI, sustainable revenue, state sustainability, public welfare and housing.
 “We talk about small and medium-sized entrepreneurs adopting AI but there seems to be scarce use of AI, due to the cost. We will be setting up the AI centre to help you,” Mohammad Fahmi said during his speech during the AI dialogue session.
 He said the state realised that there were also gaps in terms of AI adoption within the state government management itself.
 “SMEs may have funding limitations to embark on AI technologies, so we will do a match-fund model where we will pay some money and you match that to solve your problem using our facilities. 
 “This will help bring down the cost,” he said.
 He welcomed at least 30 “use cases”, a term used in system analysis to identify and organise the system requirements.
 “We need industry use cases. The SMEs can use local or foreign talents, that is entirely up to them.” 
 Elaborating on this to StarMetro, Mohammad Fahmi  said, “Ideally, they source talent locally from our universities. 
 “Our students here will then be able to use the AI centre with the foreign AI technology to solve industry problems.”
 He said AI technology could also be used to manage floods better, via sharing of information from multiple agencies and making information available at one centre.
 “For instance, if there is a lack of an item such as mattresses in Kuala Selangor, we should have an AI system whereby we can quickly locate the nearest place that has mattresses and dispatch them to the flooded location immediately,” he cited.
 He said other simple cases would be digitising meeting minutes to save time.
 “At the moment it takes about a month for a meeting’s minutes to be prepared. 
 We do not have AI system that can help with this, that is fast and accurate,” he said.
 “Another example is facial recognition for attendance at work,” he added.
 Mohammad Fahmi said AI was not just about picking and choosing the best models from web services.
 “We need mathematicians, we need to build digital models and run those models. 
 “We also need the right data to train on the models. This is the core of AI that we require.”
 In his speech, Mohammad Fahmi also touched on Selangor expecting to achieve full 5G network coverage in all its populated areas by 2025.

732902,Main,4,27/09/2024,Anwar pushes for AI talent growth,,"JOHOR BARU: Malaysia needs to grow its talent pool and produce graduates in new fields such as artificial intelligence, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
 The Prime Minister spoke of being impressed to find out during his visit to Abu Dhabi that there was already a university teaching AI there.
 “They were able to do it within a short period,” he said.
 This led to him pursuing the matter with the Higher Education Ministry, he said, adding that it usually takes one or two years to start a new faculty.
 “However, it has now been done within four months by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in Johor,” he said in his speech at the Invest Malaysia event organised by Bursa Malaysia yesterday.
 Anwar spoke about a need to partner with the private sector to develop talent.
 “We lacked a niche in the highest level. So it is important for us to produce graduates who fulfil their requirements,” he added.
 He also touched on the importance to tap the Asean market for investments as the region had a huge population of 680 million and a GDP of US$3.5 trillion (RM14.7 trillion).
 On Singapore, he said both countries would continue to collaborate to achieve a win-win situation, including the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ).
 “Yes, we have our minor differences like any other country globally but we are still excited to work with each other,” he added.
 Malaysia, he said, was generating enough energy surplus to power new major development projects.
 He said the government would continue to pursue renewable energy and energy transition initiatives, as it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while still focusing on projects like JS-SEZ.
 Mentri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said Johor’s strategic advantages and strong growth momentum made the state an unbeatable investment destination.
 “We are witnessing growing interest from investors, both locally and internationally.
 “Johor’s GDP growth outpaced the national average, expanding by 4.1% year-on-year in 2023, driven primarily by our thriving services and manufacturing sectors,” he said.
 Onn Hafiz noted that Johor recorded RM5.2bil in exports in July, with strong performances in petrochemicals, electronics and non-metallic materials.
 Later at another event in Kuala Lumpur, Anwar said he is ready to declare his assets right away if he is involved in any investigation. 
 “Some leaders, when they become the prime minister or the finance minister, they amassed hundreds of millions and some even up to billions of ringgit,” he said.
 “But when we asked them to declare their assets, they hold grudges.
 “If I were told to declare my assets tomorrow, I will declare it, probe me as much as you want,” he said at a groundbreaking ceremony for a school.
 Earlier yesterday, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) dispelled allegations that Anwar had instructed the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to investigate former premier Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, his sons, and former finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin. 
 According to a report by Bloomberg, the PMO also denied instructing MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki not to investigate share purchases by Anwar’s former political secretary Farhash Wafa Salvador. 
 “The Prime Minister’s Office affirms that the Prime Minister has never issued directives or interfered in investigations conducted by the MACC. The MACC operates as an independent body, acting on the basis of complaints received,” it said.",johor baru malaysia talent pool graduate field artificial intelligence datuk seri anwar ibrahim prime minister impressed visit abu dhabi university short period pursuing matter education ministry start faculty month universiti teknologi malaysia johor speech malaysia event bursa malaysia yesterday anwar partner private sector talent niche level graduate requirement tap asean market investment region huge population gdp singapore country collaborate win win situation johor special economic zone sez minor difference country malaysia energy surplus power major development project government pursue renewable energy energy transition initiative aim net emission project sez mentri besar datuk onn hafiz ghazi johor strategic advantage strong growth momentum unbeatable investment destination investor johor gdp growth national average driven service sector hafiz johor bil export strong performance petrochemical electronics metallic material event kuala anwar ready declare asset investigation leader minister finance minister hundred million billion declare asset grudge declare asset tomorrow declare probe ceremony school yesterday prime minister office pmo allegation malaysian anti corruption commission investigate premier tun mahathir mohamad son minister tun daim zainuddin report bloomberg pmo macc chief commissioner tan sri azam baki investigate share purchase political secretary farhash wafa salvador prime minister office affirms minister directive interfered investigation macc macc independent body basis complaint,"[(5, 0.9433058), (13, 0.051850867)]",5
733060,StarESG,28,27/09/2024,Enabling sustainable businesses via AI,,"THE rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries across the Asia Pacific, however it poses uncharted waters for many, especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). 
 StarESG explores the potential of AI and why it’s the new way of doing business, with liquid cooling technology expert Vertiv (M) Sdn Bhd – which provides a comprehensive solution for managing data centre heat by reducing energy consumption, enhancing efficiency and supporting scalable systems. 
 The company’s High Density Compute and AI business director for Asia, Alvin Cheang provided greater insights on AI’s role in sustainability.
 How can artificial intelligence (AI) technologies contribute to creating a more inclusive society?  
 Vertiv recognises the transformative potential of AI in bridging the digital divide and empowering underserved communities. 
 By personalising learning experiences and developing assistive technologies, AI can improve access to education and enable individuals with disabilities to participate more fully in society. 
 Moreover, AI’s ability to analyse vast amounts of data can help identify and address critical social issues, such as poverty and limited healthcare access. 
 As a company, we are committed to leveraging new technologies like AI to enhance our collaboration with customers, consultants and partners. 
 In what ways can AI be used to bridge the digital divide and ensure equal access to opportunities? 
 We recognise the immense potential of AI to transform various aspects of society, from bridging the digital divide and empowering underserved communities to enhancing connectivity, education, healthcare and language accessibility. 
 By leveraging AI technologies, we can optimise network infrastructure, personalise learning experiences, facilitate remote healthcare services, break down language barriers, and promote financial inclusion. 
 Moreover, AI has the power to reduce human biases in critical decision-making processes, such as hiring, lending and resource allocation. 
 AI is not merely a technology but an ecosystem that requires collaboration among governments, stakeholders and industry partners to drive digitisation and optimise its use in various sectors, such as traffic control. 
 How can SMEs leverage AI technologies to enhance their competitiveness and drive growth?
 We have observed that organisations with enterprise data centres are diversifying their investments and deployment strategies, particularly in AI, to meet sustainability objectives. 
 This shift is expected to impact edge application deployments and the overall IT landscape. 
 On-premise capacity for proprietary AI and optimising existing infrastructure through incremental investment, service, and maintenance can help organisations free up capacity in maxed-out computing environments and increase energy efficiency. 
 Moreover, extending the life of existing servers can reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions, as opposed to replacing and scrapping them. 
 AI can also help SMEs strengthen their cybersecurity defences by detecting and responding to potential threats in real-time through AI-powered security systems that analyse network traffic, identify anomalies, and proactively mitigate risks. 
 Vertiv Asia vice president and general manager Paul Churchill said, “Across Asia, we’re seeing organisations ramp up their investments, realigning their strategies towards harnessing and integrating AI technology. In fact, according to IDC, by 2026, tech providers will allocate significant investments towards AI/automation.” 
 SMEs can start small and achieve AI applications or adopt AI technologies by leasing cost-effective AI cloud services from key leaders like Alibaba, AWS and Microsoft Cloud. 
 Dedicated servers, which are affordable and price-sensitive AI servers, are also available in the market. 
 What challenges do SMEs face when adopting AI, and how can these challenges be overcome?
 SMEs may face various challenges when adopting AI technologies, including financial constraints, lack of knowledge and skills, ethical and legal considerations, and access to high-quality data. 
 To overcome financial barriers, SMEs can collaborate with government agencies, industry associations, or financial institutions to secure funding support, grants, or loans for AI adoption. 
 Addressing the knowledge and skills gap requires investment in AI education programmes, workshops and collaboration with universities or AI service providers. 
 SMEs should also prioritise ethical considerations, adopt transparent models, collaborate with legal experts, stay updated with regulations, and comply with data protection laws to build trust and ensure responsible AI adoption. 
 Effective communication, employee training and demonstrating AI benefits can help overcome resistance to change.
 To tackle data-related challenges, SMEs can partner with larger organisations or data providers, collaborate with data analytics companies, and invest in data management systems. 
 How does Vertiv’s scaling/cooling solutions support the AI infrastructure requirements of SMEs and large corporations?
 Vertiv offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for scalable AI infrastructure, including prefabricated modular solutions that can be combined and scaled to meet current and future needs. 
 We also provide a wide range of cooling solutions for AI and high-performance computing, such as rear door heat exchangers, direct-to-chip liquid cooling, coolant distribution units, high-capacity free-cooling chillers, and large capacity chilled water-based prefabricated modular data centre solutions. 
 The optimised designs minimise disruption to existing workloads by leveraging available cooling infrastructure and heat rejection. 
 Vertiv’s solutions also offer flexibility and customisation by reusing or retrofitting existing cooling systems, reducing deployment costs and allowing for more efficient AI infrastructure implementation.
 What are the key considerations for SMEs when implementing AI technologies to ensure scalability and efficiency?
 When SMEs implement AI technologies, they need to ensure their infrastructure is ready to scale and operate efficiently. 
 This involves assessing and possibly upgrading their current IT infrastructure to handle increased computational power and storage demands. Investing in scalable solutions, such as cloud services and modular data centres, can provide the necessary flexibility as AI initiatives expand. 
 Additionally, ensuring the infrastructure’s reliability through redundant systems, backup power solutions, and efficient cooling systems is crucial to minimise downtime and maintain continuous operations. 
 Data management is another critical aspect, where the focus should be on maintaining high-quality, secure data with strong governance frameworks. 
 Advanced storage solutions optimised for fast data retrieval and processing are essential to support AI applications. 
 Cost management also plays a significant role; SMEs should plan their investments carefully, starting with smaller projects then gradually scaling up
 They should also consider long-term operational costs, including maintenance, energy consumption, and potential upgrades. 
 Energy-efficient infrastructure can help mitigate ongoing costs, making the adoption of AI more sustainable.
 What role does sustainability play in the deployment of AI technologies, and how does Vertiv address this aspect in its scaling/cooling solutions?
 Vertiv recognises the importance of sustainability in AI deployments as the data centre industry faces challenges in addressing energy consumption, costs and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 To support the growing demand for AI capabilities and the need for innovative power and cooling infrastructure, Vertiv offers end-to-end AI power and cooling solutions that simplify data centre infrastructure selection and deployment.

732554,StarBiz,15,26/09/2024,"AI market will surge to nearly US$1 trillion by 2027, Bain says",,"NEW YORK: The global market for artificial intelligence (AI)-related products is ballooning and will hit as much as US$990bil in 2027, as the technology’s quick adoption disrupts companies and economies, Bain & Co says.
 The market, including AI-related services and hardware, will grow 40% to 55% annually from US$185bil last year, the consulting firm said in its fifth annual Global Technology Report released yesterday. 
 That will lead to revenue of US$780bil to US$990bil, Bain said.
 The growth will be fuelled by bigger AI systems and larger data centres to train and run them, driven by companies and governments using the technology to boost efficiency. 
 Demand is rising so fast that it’ll strain supply chains for components, including chips needed to run the services, Bain said. 
 Combined with geopolitical tensions, rising sales could trigger shortages in semiconductors, personal computers and smartphones, Bain warned.
 Demand for upstream chip components such as integrated circuit design and related IP could rise 30% or more by 2026, putting pressure on manufacturers, Bain said. 
 The cost of larger data centres could jump from US$1bil to US$4bil now to between US$10bil and US$25bil in five years, as their capacity expands to more than a gigawatt from 50 to 200 megawatts currently, it said.
 “These changes are expected to have huge implications on the ecosystems that support data centres, including infrastructure engineering, power production and cooling,” the consultancy said.
 Companies are moving beyond an experimentation phase and beginning to scale generative AI across their operations. 
 Small language models, similar to the large language models that led to the creation of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, but lightweight and efficient, could be favoured by enterprises and countries.
 This comes amid concerns surrounding costs and data privacy.

 Barisan Nasional candidate Syed Hussien Syed Abdullah and his rival from Perikatan Nasional Mohamad Haizan Jaafar each had their own songs composed using AI technology, coalition officials said. 
 Barisan and Umno Youth chief Dr Muhamad Akmal Salleh said the coalition’s song for Mahkota was created using AI in less than a day.
 “It took just one night. The song was created on nomination day and has been played since Sept 15.
 “The song is catchy and has gained traction on TikTok. Some children here even sing ‘Hussien, Hussien’ (the song’s chorus) when they see our candidate,” he told reporters while on the campaign trail.
 The song has also been translated into Mandarin and Tamil with the help of party leaders.
 “They reviewed the lyrics, sentence structure and pronunciation ... to ensure everything was accurate before we started using it,” said Dr Muhamad Akmal.
 Johor Perikatan Youth chief Ahmad Nawfal Mahfodz said the coalition saved lots of time by using AI to compose the song for Mohamad Haizan.
 “We came up with the main points and message we wanted the song to convey. It took some time to input these ideas, but once done, the AI created the song,” he said.
 “It used to take at least two weeks to compose a song, but now it can be done in less than two days,” he said, adding that AI is a “positive tool when used ethically”.
 Both candidates and their campaign workers are leveraging on social media to reach out to outstation voters to persuade them to return on polling day this Saturday. 
 Barisan is using community WhatsApp groups in Mahkota to reach as many residents as possible before polling day, said Syed Hussien.
 Perikatan meanwhile is focused on creating attractive messages on Facebook and TikTok to get younger voters to turnout in large numbers, said Mohamad Haizan, adding that a multifaceted approach was important. 
 Malaysia Cyber Consumer Association president Siraj Jalil said the use of AI in this by-election reflects how quickly technological developments are reshaping election campaigns.
 “I’m confident that the next general election in Malaysia will look very different from past elections. The Mahkota by-election is a good indication of this,” he said when contacted.
 In the future, political parties may also use AI tools such as ChatGPT to generate campaign narratives and counter-arguments, he said.   
 So far, Siraj has not detected any significant use of technology to spread disinformation or misinformation.
 “This is a good sign, and we should embrace it. I do not condone the use of AI for ill intentions,” he said.
 The by-election was triggered when its incumbent Datuk Sharifah Azizah Syed Zain of Umno died on Aug 2, three days after being hospitalised.
 She had won the seat in the March 2022 Johor state election with a majority of 5,166 votes, defeating candidates from Perikatan, Pakatan Harapan and Parti Warisan.",kluang catchy campaign artificial intelligence campaign rival party election expert technology lie nasional candidate hussien syed abdullah rival perikatan nasional mohamad haizan jaafar song technology coalition official umno youth chief muhamad akmal salleh coalition song mahkota day night song nomination day sept song catchy traction tiktok child hussien hussien song chorus candidate reporter campaign trail song mandarin tamil party leader lyric sentence structure pronunciation accurate muhamad akmal johor perikatan youth chief ahmad nawfal mahfodz coalition lot time compose song mohamad haizan main message song convey time input idea song week song day positive tool candidate campaign worker social medium outstation voter return day saturday barisan community mahkota reach resident day hussien perikatan attractive message tiktok voter mohamad haizan approach malaysia consumer association president siraj jalil election technological development election campaign confident election malaysia election election indication future political party tool chatgpt campaign narrative argument technology spread disinformation misinformation sign condone intention election incumbent datuk sharifah azizah zain umno aug day seat march johor election majority candidate perikatan pakatan harapan parti warisan,"[(1, 0.99427235)]",1
731868,StarBiz,15,24/09/2024,Lula to lead push for  AI rules at G20 summit,Brazil champions the interests of Global South,"BRASILIA: As the planet’s largest economies struggle to forge consensus on the future of artificial intelligence (AI), Brazil premiere Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants to ensure the developing world isn’t left out of the debate.
 The Brazilian leader has added AI to his list of priorities for his country’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) nations this year, seizing on the position to try to shape regulatory discussions that are raging from Europe to Asia to the United Nations (UN), where the technology is expected to be a major theme of this week’s General Assembly.
 Already seeking reforms to global institutions like the UN Security Council, Lula wants to use November’s G20 leaders’ summit to craft a governance framework that includes the interests of Global South nations and forces AI superpowers China and the United States to the table, according to two people familiar with his views.
 “The big challenge is reducing inequalities, because there is already inequality today,” Luciana Santos, Brazil’s Science and Technology Minister said in an interview with Bloomberg News. 
 “We want to reduce this within countries and to do this we need to encourage the development of AI, especially for countries in the Global South.”
 Doing so won’t be easy, and not just because Lula will have to convince nations battling for position in the technological arms race that Brazil, whose AI capabilities and regulations lag those of other G20 members, is the right country to lead the conversation.
 The G20 is also in the midst of an identity crisis as two major wars and fierce economic competition divide its most powerful members. 
 Reaching consensus on any topic, much less one as complex as AI, has proven increasingly difficult in that climate, as Lula’s efforts to craft a global tax on billionaires has already demonstrated. 
 And even if it does succeed in developing a framework, Brazil will have to convince nations to adhere to the guidelines to prevent it from becoming just another G20 resolution with little real-world force.
 No matter the challenges, Lula has embraced the issue as part of a career-long campaign to position himself as a leader of the Global South, one who can use Brazil’s relative power to give developing nations a voice on major issues.
 His priority is an agreement on baseline standards of governance that give a wide range of countries a say in who gains access to AI and its benefits. 
 Advisers cite his desire to avoid a repeat of the global divide in nuclear technology, in which a handful of nations have an outsize advantage over those that lack access to such weapons. 
 Brazil is also pressing members to mitigate potential workforce disruptions from AI, create ways to safeguard intellectual property and address the military use of AI as it begins to appear on battlefields in Ukraine and the Middle East, according to one of the people familiar with his views.
 Lula is answering calls from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has repeatedly stressed that new AI rules shouldn’t be developed solely by rich nations.
 So far, they largely have been. China has implemented strict guidelines on the technology, while the European Union approved a comprehensive rulebook that bans AI use in some cases and restricts other applications considered “high-risk.” 
 President Joe Biden has called for strong AI regulations, but the US has yet to produce them.
 China and the United States, meanwhile, have largely monopolised AI initiatives at the UN, with each successfully pitching their own General Assembly resolutions on the issue this year. 
 “To truly harness AI’s potential, we need international cooperation and solidarity,” Guterres said this month in China. 
 “The risks posed by AI are equally uneven.

731578,StarBiz,8,23/09/2024,Vietnam ranks second in Gen AI startups in Asean,Share of ventures predicted to rise from 27% to 35%,"HANOI: Vietnam has emerged as a key player in the development of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), securing second place in Asean for the dynamism and growth of Gen AI startups, according to the Asean GenAI Start-up Report 2024.
 This promising position reflects Vietnam’s significant potential, not just within the region but on a global scale, as highlighted by GenAI Fund partner  Denning Tan at the Asean GenAI Start-up Report Launch Roadshow in Hanoi last week.
 The event was hosted by GenAI Fund, the first South-East Asia-based Gen AI investment fund, in partnership with Amazon Web Services, Databricks and Vietnam’s National Innovation Centre (NIC). 
 It aimed to provide crucial insights into the rapidly evolving Gen AI ecosystem across South-East Asia.
 Tan emphasised that the Asean GenAI Start-up Report 2024, based on surveys across six countries, outlines the trends, opportunities and resources shaping the future of Gen AI in the region. 
 The report surveyed 500 startups over three months, offering data-driven insights for startups, governments and businesses on how Gen AI technologies are transforming industries across Asean, with Vietnam emerging as a critical innovation hub.
 “Vietnam is becoming an important Gen AI development hub in Asean,” Tan said.
 He predicted that Vietnam’s share of Gen AI startups in the region would rise from 27% to 35%, moving closer to Singapore’s position. 
 Tan noted Vietnam’s advantages, including its skilled technical talent and culture of rapid product development.
 “Our research indicates that Vietnam is well-positioned in the Gen AI space. 
 “The combination of government support, strong technical education and entrepreneurial spirit creates favourable conditions for Gen AI innovation in Vietnam.”
 NIC deputy director Do Tien Thinh stressed the fundamental role of AI in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which drives advancements in productivity, competitiveness and sustainable economic growth. 
 He noted that AI, particularly Gen AI, is breaking new ground, offering unprecedented possibilities for humanity. 
 AI is now applied across various sectors, from healthcare and education to manufacturing and agriculture.
 The Vietnamese government recognises AI’s importance and has implemented several policies to promote its research, development and uses. 
 In line with this, the Ministry of Planning and Investment has submitted a proposal to the prime minister to develop a semiconductor workforce, aiming to have at least 5,000 engineers with AI expertise by 2030.
 Additionally, the NIC has been tasked with establishing an AI-focused research and training centre, targeting the development of 7,000 AI experts and incubating 500 AI startups by 2030.
 At the event, three pioneering Gen AI startups in Vietnam – Reforged Labs, Lex Engine and Laka.ai – showcased innovative applications.

731726,Main,22,23/09/2024,AI joins search for valuable metals,,"PEERING into their computer screens in California last year, the data crunchers watched a subterranean fortune come into focus.
 What they saw transported them 16,000km across the world, to Zambia, and then 1.6km straight down into Earth. A rich lode of copper, deep in the bedrock, appeared before them, its contours revealed by a complex artificial intelligence-driven technology they had been painstakingly building for years.
 On July 11, their company, KoBold Metals, informed its business partners that their find is likely the largest copper discovery in more than a decade.
 According to their estimates, reviewed by The New York Times, the mine would produce at least 300,000 tons of copper a year once fully operational. That corresponds to a value of billions of dollars a year, for decades.
 The Times also reviewed an independent, third-party assessment of KoBold’s claims, which, while slightly more conservative than KoBold’s own, largely corroborated the size of the deposit.
 In a statement, KoBold said it expected the value of the mine to grow because it had yet to map the full extent of its highest-grade ore.
 It’s the first confirmed success for a company that hopes to radically transform the way we find metals critical not only to the tech industry but to the fight against climate change.
 The geopolitical significance is vast. KoBold’s find comes as the United States and China are increasingly clashing over global access to the minerals needed to manufacture clean energy technologies.
 KoBold originated a half-decade ago in the belated realisation among Silicon Valley’s barons of what lay ahead.
 Their products had become the backbone of the US economy. 
 But their businesses couldn’t grow much further without a gargantuan increase in the mining of a handful of raw materials that make batteries, without which everything from cellphones to electric trucks simply can’t function. They needed far more copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel.
 Hundreds of new mines would be necessary, analysts calculated. And not just for consumer products, but for the house-size lithium-ion batteries needed for backup on the nation’s power grids as solar and wind power ebbs and flows.
 AI data centres demand huge amounts of copper. Advanced weaponry requires nickel and cobalt.
 Over two decades of production, KoBold’s find in Zambia would yield enough copper for 100 million of today’s average-size electric vehicle batteries.
 “The more you realise how dependent we are on these technologies, the more you ask: how the hell were we so slow to the fact that we needed vast amounts of raw material to make it all possible?” said Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, the biggest venture capital firm in the United States and an early investor in KoBold.
 The traditional mining industry lacked a convincing solution. Using exploration techniques largely unchanged in a century, the cost of new discoveries was rising while the pace of the finds slowed.
 Around the same time, the US government had a similar lightbulb moment. America had become far too reliant on China for these essential resources.
 China had been heavily investing in global mining and metal processing, and controlled the production of 20% to 80% of its supply chains. The United States, on the other hand, has relatively few processing plants or mines, domestic or foreign, for most battery metals.
 The International Energy Forum, a research organisation, recently estimated that the world would need between 35 and 194 large new mines for copper alone through 2050. That translates to between one and six new copper mines, every year, the size of the one KoBold plans to dig in Zambia.
 Investors from American and European private equity funds that collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets, including ones started by Silicon Valley giants such as Bill Gates and Sam Altman of OpenAI, were joined by more traditional industrial companies in putting hundreds of millions of dollars into KoBold.
 It already has 60-odd exploration projects in various countries. In some cases, such as Zambia, where production is expected to begin in the early 2030s, it plans to own stakes in the mines themselves.
 Its CEO and co-founder, Kurt House, embraces the moneymaking potential of KoBold’s technology, which is the company’s alone to profit from. He is fond of saying, “I don’t need to be reminded again that I’m a capitalist.”
 The work is about to get a lot less theoretical.
 KoBold is pumping US$2.3bil into its first mine and is negotiating tricky partnerships with contractors and governments alike. It is relying on the US government to finance a new railway to export the copper. And, like the mining barons of yore, its leaders will soon be exposed to the social and environmental trade-offs that almost all mining poses.
  KoBold’s find looks like a proof of concept with potentially huge payout for investors. And the company’s partners include Zambia itself: the state mining company owns 20%.
 That Zambians will benefit, though, is far from a foregone conclusion.
 Mining has left waste piled across Copperbelt province, spawning lawsuits. One case alleges that local rivers at one point ran bright blue with copper tailings. And despite a century of mining, Zambia remains one of the world’s least-developed and most-indebted countries.
 “The value of copper that has left Zambia is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Hold that figure in your mind, and then look around yourself in Zambia,” said Grieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist. 
 “The link between resource and benefit is severed.”
 KoBold’s team is still determining exactly where to dig the mine’s shaft. There is a lake directly above the ore, and a major highway, along with the village of Kawama.
 “For a find this valuable, there’s nothing on the surface we can’t move,” said George Gilchrist, a South African geologist who is leading KoBold’s exploration in Zambia.
 In an interview in the capital, Lusaka, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema said one way to ensure greater benefits was for his country to own more of the mine.
 He said he was pressing KoBold to increase the share owned by the state mining company to above one-third. The extra money “will allow us to invest in sectors that ordinarily are difficult for us,” he said.
 Hichilema is desperate for revenue.
 More than one-third of his budget goes toward repaying international debts, leaving little for health and education.
 Most of the capital gets only a few hours of electricity per day. It will take more than a slightly bigger stake in one mine, however large the mine may be, to solve that.
 “The benefits of this mine for Zambia,” Chelwa said, “are purely theoretical at this point.”
 For the US government, the benefits are far more clear.
 “We are the American beachhead in Africa,” said Jennifer Fendrick, KoBold’s director for government affairs. “And that’s how the government sees it.”
 Before joining KoBold, she was a senior US State Department strategist on critical minerals.
 Although the US government hasn’t directly invested in KoBold, it is partially underwriting a US$2.3bil railway to the Angolan coast from Copperbelt province, enabling copper to be more easily be shipped to the United States.
 It’s the United States’ single-biggest investment to catch up to China in Africa’s battery-metal sweepstakes.
 There are other ways the United States could procure battery metals, but they face big obstacles.
 Parts of the seabed are rich in critical minerals, but a dispute has raged for years over how, or whether, oceans should be mined. And more mines could be opened within the United States itself, but that prospect has drawn objections, particularly from indigenous communities.
 Whether the United States sticks with its climate goals also hinges on this year’s presidential election. A win by former pre­sident Donald Trump would very likely severely curtail energy transition incentives.For now, the Biden administration is pushing ahead.
 “We need 25 times as much cobalt as we currently mine,” Jose Fernandez, the State Department’s top energy official, said in an interview recently, not to mention all the other metals and minerals reshaping the global economy.

731196,StarHealth,5,22/09/2024,Doctors using AI without proper guidance,,"A FIFTH of family doctors (general practitioners or GPs) seem to have readily incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) into their clinical practice, despite a lack of any formal guidance or clear work policies on the use of these tools, suggest the findings of an online UK-wide snapshot survey, published in the open access journal BMJ Health & Care Informatics.
 Doctors and medical trainees need to be fully informed about the pros and cons of AI, especially because of the inherent risks of inaccuracies (‘hallucinations’), algorithmic biases, and the potential to compromise patient privacy, conclude the researchers.
 Following the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, interest in large language model-powered chatbots has soared, and attention has increasingly focused on the clinical potential of these tools, say the researchers.
 To gauge current use of chatbots to assist with any aspect of clinical practice in the United Kingdom, in February 2024 the researchers distributed an online survey to a randomly chosen sample of GPs registered with  the clinician marketing service Doctors.net.uk. 
 The survey had a predetermined sample size of 1,000.
 The doctors were asked if they had ever used any of the following in any aspect of their clinical practice: ChatGPT; Bing AI; Google’s Bard; or ‘Other’. 
 And they were subsequently asked what they used these tools for.
 Some 1,006 GPs completed the survey: just over half the responses came from men (531; 53%) and a similar proportion of respondents (544; 54%) were aged 46 or older.
 One in five (205; 20%) respondents reported using generative AI tools in their clinical practice. 
 Of this, more than one in four (29%; 47) reported using these tools to generate documentation after patient appointments and a similar proportion (28%; 45) said they used them to suggest a differential diagnosis. 
 One in four (25%; 40) said they used the tools to suggest treatment options.
 The researchers acknowledge that the survey respondents may not be representative of all UK GPs, and that those who responded may have been particularly interested in AI – for good or bad – potentially introducing a level of bias into the findings. 
 Further research is needed to find out more about how doctors are using generative AI and how best to implement these tools safely and securely into clinical practice, they add.
 “These findings signal that GPs may derive value from these tools, particularly with administrative tasks and to support clinical reasoning. 
 “However, we caution that these tools have limitations since they can embed subtle errors and biases,” they say.
 And they point out: “(These tools) may also risk harm and undermine patient privacy since it is not clear how the internet companies behind generative AI use the information they gather.
 “While these chatbots are increasingly the target of regulatory efforts, it remains unclear how the legislation will intersect in a practical way with these tools in clinical practice.”
 They conclude: “The medical community will need to find ways to both educate physicians and trainees about the potential benefits of these tools in summarising information but also the risks in terms of hallucinations (perception of non-existent patterns or objects), algorithmic biases, and the potential to  compromise patient privacy.”",family doctor practitioner artificial intelligence clinical practice lack formal guidance policy finding wide snapshot survey access journal bmj health care informatics doctor medical trainee pro con inherent risk inaccuracy hallucination potential compromise patient privacy conclude researcher chatgpt language model chatbots attention clinical potential tool researcher current chatbots aspect clinical practice kingdom february researcher online survey sample gps clinician marketing service doctor net survey sample size doctor clinical practice chatgpt google bard gps survey half proportion respondent respondent generative tool clinical practice tool generate documentation patient appointment differential diagnosis tool treatment option researcher survey respondent representative gps bad level bias finding doctor implement tool clinical practice finding signal gps derive tool administrative task clinical caution tool limitation subtle error tool risk undermine patient privacy internet company gather chatbots regulatory effort unclear legislation intersect practical tool clinical practice conclude medical community physician potential benefit tool risk term hallucination perception existent pattern algorithmic bias potential compromise patient privacy,"[(11, 0.99364966)]",11
731224,StarEdu,7,22/09/2024,Learning with an ‘AI buddy’,Virtual teaching assistants enhance student engagement with customised support,"We live in a digital world where the modern workforce increasingly relies on digital innovations to drive solutions, generate new content, and harness transformative technologies that can redefine industries. 
 This calls for an educational approach that prepares our graduates for a rapidly changing world, equipping them with adaptability and tech-savviness – skills highly valued by employers.
 Universities, in particular, need to move away from traditional passive knowledge dissemination to dynamic, interactive learning experiences that empower students to take ownership of their educational journey. 
 This approach cultivates curiosity, self-directed learning, collaboration, and problem-solving skills, enabling students to thrive in a technology-driven world.
 The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies has transformed the way students receive personalised assistance and support, making it a revolutionary development in education. 
 Imagine if every university lecturer had an AI counterpart available to their students 24/7. This long-awaited goal in online learning is becoming a reality, making personalised learning accessible to every student.
 These AI doubles, more commonly known as virtual teaching assistants, will “work closely” with the lecturers to handle routine tasks, such as generating quizzes, providing personalised feedback on assignments, offering immediate assistance, answering questions, and clarifying doubts in real time – allowing lecturers to focus more on direct student interaction, ultimately providing targeted support for every student. This is an example where learning with AI can be better than reality.
 For students, the use of an AI buddy in learning could enhance their engagement, as they will receive customised support in various ways. 
 An AI buddy can create personalised content tailored to each student’s learning preferences. By integrating dynamic conversation prompts based on student responses, an AI buddy can foster a deeper understanding, encourage critical thinking, and help students connect concepts to real-world issues.
 Additionally, an AI buddy can track students’ progress in the learning management system, and increase learning outcomes with enhanced and personalised feedback. 
 For instance, lecturers could use rubric-based AI grading to evaluate student responses in assignments, offering tailored feedback for improvement to each student.
 However, adopting AI in education at the university level presents several challenges. If students do not use generative AI (GenAI) responsibly, it may lead to a compromise in the attainment of learning outcomes and eventually affect the quality of graduates.
 Students need to understand the limitations of GenAI technology. It is not perfect and can produce false or illogical information. 
 In certain circumstances, GenAI may lack discernment and be unable to distinguish between right and wrong information. It can fabricate information and generate fictitious references to non-existent texts.
 Furthermore, students are not allowed to submit work generated by AI as their own without proper attribution, as this constitutes academic dishonesty and is equivalent to cheating. The use of GenAI must be referenced appropriately according to the referencing style required by their lecturers.
 Students should consult their course instructors about the expectations regarding the use of GenAI for learning tasks or assessments. 
 They are responsible for checking and verifying the results generated by AI against other sources, acknowledging the contribution of GenAI technology, and being accountable for any errors or omissions.
 Lastly, the ethical consideration in embracing GenAI in education involves the privacy and security of students’ data. GenAI often relies on large language models and requires massive amounts of data to train the model effectively. The deployment of AI in education must prevent unauthorised or unintended usage of sensitive personal information and academic records from students.
 Universities must also implement robust ethical guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from students for data usage, and ensuring students have the option to opt out of any data collection by the AI system. 
 It is also crucial for universities to ensure their AI systems are trained with transparent algorithms, and are regularly audited for responsible and optimal use of GenAI.

730994,Main,6,21/09/2024,Keeping AI use in check,Govt launches code of ethics to rein in fast-growing tech,"PUTRAJAYA: To put a stop to comments like it “sounds like me, looks like me but it is not me”, the government has launched a code of ethics to ensure artificial intelligence (AI) is used ethically, says Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof.
 The Deputy Prime Minister said the code of ethics, known as the Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines (AIGE), is a framework for setting parameters for AI users and also serves as a regulatory measure for responsible development and adoption of AI technology. 
 The government will also start a National Artificial Intelligence Office (NAIO) in November and the formation of a Data Commission is in the works. 
 Fadillah said this after launching the AIGE here yesterday with Science, Technology and Inno­vation Minister Chang Lih Kang and Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo. 
 “It is important to apply the AIGE to ensure that there is transparency and accountability at every level of AI as proof of the government’s commitment to further build the trust of the public towards this technology.  
 “We must ensure that all decisions taken by an AI system are based on accurate data and free of bias which will corrode justice and fairness.
 “These guidelines also stress privacy and personal data protection of users, as data is now a valuable commodity. 
 “We must ensure that the rights to privacy of all individuals are always respected and protected, including how data is collected, stored and used by the AI system,” Fadillah said. 
 He cautioned the need for the government to be wary of the social and economic implications of AI which could replace manpower and increase unemployment. 
 “It is important to educate the younger generation on the potentials and risks of AI. 
 “Early education on ethics in technology should be made part of the education curriculum to enable children to be technology-literate and responsible in the usage of technology,” Fadillah said. 
 Chang said while AIGE would not be imposed on the private sector, it would be the first step towards enacting legislation in the space. 
 “The AIGE is not a law per se, but a guideline. We hope that some parts of the guidelines can be taken up as law but this (process) will take time. 
 “Before we move to enact legislation, we hope AIGE can be made a reference by all AI industry players to enable them to comply and discipline themselves. 
 “The current laws are enough to curb scams, but AI is advancing very quickly and we need a reference to make sure that everyone abides by a set of guidelines. 
 “This is the start of a process. Just like teaching children morals, we cannot enforce everything that we teach,” Chang said. 
 He said that he would discuss with the Education Ministry to incorporate these guidelines in school curriculums as children need to understand the ethics of AI. 
 He added that the AIGE would be updated in line with technological advancements.
 Earlier in his speech, Chang said the market value of AI in Malaysia this year was projected to reach RM1.5bil, with JP Morgan Research predicting the Gross Domestic Product of the world economy to expand by 10% – between US$7 trillion and US$10 trillion – over the next few years.He added that the worry of unethical AI usage was in the spreading of fake news especially – which uses deepfakes, impersonation of identities, fakery and manipulation of sensitive data.
 “The AIGE code of ethics is developed especially for the application and reference of three main groups – users, policymakers and those who offer the technology. 
 Gobind said that AI had the potential to generate US$113.4bil (RM477bil) to the country’s economy. 
 He pointed out that AIGE was another government effort to further strengthen existing legislation dealing with data usage and technology – such as the Cybersecurity Act 2024, Personal Data Protection Act 2010 and the proposed Omnibus Bill. 
 “AIGE will play an important role when the NAIO under MyDigital Corporation begins operating this November to build an ecosystem for AI in the country’s digital transformation.
 “The Digital Ministry will also form a Malaysian Data Commission to ensure effective data management and protection, in line with the trend of setting up data development centres and investments of companies such as AWS, Google, ByteDance, Nvidia, Microsoft and Vantage,” Gobind said.",putrajaya comment government code ethic artificial intelligence datuk seri fadillah deputy prime minister code ethic artificial intelligence governance ethic guideline parameter user regulatory measure responsible development adoption technology government national artificial intelligence office naio formation data commission fadillah aige yesterday science technology inno vation minister chang lih kang digital minister gobind singh deo aige transparency accountability level proof government commitment trust public technology decision system accurate data free bias corrode justice fairness guideline stress personal data protection user valuable commodity right privacy individual protected data system fadillah government wary social economic implication manpower increase unemployment educate generation potential education ethic technology education curriculum enable child technology literate responsible usage technology fadillah chang aige private sector step legislation space aige law guideline hope guideline law process time enact legislation reference industry player discipline current law curb scam reference abides guideline process child moral teach chang education ministry incorporate guideline school curriculum child ethic updated technological advancement speech chang market malaysia reach bil morgan gross domestic product economy worry unethical usage fake news deepfakes impersonation identity manipulation sensitive data ethic application reference main user policymakers technology gobind potential generate bil bil country economy aige government effort legislation data usage technology cybersecurity personal data protection omnibus bill aige play role mydigital corporation build ecosystem country digital transformation digital ministry form malaysian data commission effective data management protection trend data development investment company google bytedance nvidia microsoft vantage gobind,"[(4, 0.19779088), (7, 0.7983896)]",7
730998,Main,6,21/09/2024,Expert: Don’t confine AI code of ethics to govt entities,,"PUTRAJAYA: A code of ethics on the use and development of artificial intelligence (AI) should not just be confined to government entities but also expanded to the private sector, says an expert.
 The Artificial Intelligence Governance and Ethics Guidelines (AIGE),  based on seven main principles, were launched here yesterday as a regulatory measure for responsible development and adoption of AI technology. 
 Dr Azree Nazri from Universiti Putra Malaysia’s Institute of Mathematical Research said the policy is pivotal in shaping the future of the country’s AI industry. 
 “With China’s overwhelming lead in generative AI patents and the complexities of effective regulation, Malaysia faces a challenging path. 
 “The AIGE offers a strong framework for responsible AI, but limiting it to government entities reduces its overall impact – as most AI development is led by private companies,” he said when contacted. 
 Azree – who is also Artificial Intelligence Society Malaysia president – said that without alignment from the private sector, AI practices could remain fragmented and undermine the goal of ethical governance.
 “Incentives can help bridge this gap. Benefits such as tax breaks, grants and recognition programmes encourage companies to voluntarily adopt AIGE standards. 
 “Through voluntary adoption, collaboration and government incentives, AIGE’s goals of fostering fair, transparent and accountable AI can be achieved across both public and private sectors,” he said. 
 However, he said Malaysia had yet to have any local AI infrastructure.
 “The AIGE is akin to establishing an airspace law but ‘without airports and airplanes’,” Nazree said. 
 He also said besides China, Malaysia needed to learn from the United States with regard to regulations governing the AI industry.
 “In the US, regulators are grappling with how to manage the risks associated with high-capability AI systems. One approach involves setting thresholds for AI models based on their computational power. 
 “The move aims at addressing potential dangers without stifling technological progress, a strategy that Malaysia may need to consider as it develops its own regulatory framework,” Azree said. 
 Meanwhile, Cybersecurity consultant Fong Choong Fook said the AIGE was the best set of regulations the government could come up with to govern AI.
 He said imposing ethics into law for AI would be very difficult for now due to the fluidity and variables of AI. 
 “With Malaysia just beginning to dabble in AI and with the future being bright for AI development and usage, this is a good time to set down such a code of ethics. 
 “This would enable the ethics to be ingrained from the start,” he said.
 The seven AIGE principles are fairness; reliability, safety and control; privacy and security; inclusiveness; transparency; accountability and the pursuit of human benefit and happiness. 
 Under the fairness principles, the development of AI must be designed to avoid bias or discrimination against the target users. 
 According to the second principle, AI systems should perform as intended with consent for usage of data the top priority. 
 The principle of privacy and security also encourages constant, consistent testing and certification as well as risk and impact assessments.
 All AI systems should not have one-size-fits-all approaches and should address the widest possible range of factors – such as age, gender, religion and ethnicity.
 Transparency is pertinent in contexts where AI is used as part of decision-making and AI algorithms should be transparent – be they technical processes or human decisions. 
 Besides accountability, the other principle caters to respecting human-centred values and enhancing quality of life while ensuring that AI systems do not undermine human autonomy through governance mechanisms.",putrajaya code ethic development artificial intelligence government entity private sector artificial intelligence governance ethic guideline main principle yesterday regulatory measure responsible development adoption technology azree nazri universiti putra malaysia institute mathematical policy pivotal shaping future country industry china lead generative patent complexity effective regulation malaysia path aige strong framework responsible limiting government entity impact development private company azree artificial intelligence society malaysia president alignment private sector practice fragmented undermine goal ethical governance incentive gap benefit tax break grant recognition programme company aige standard voluntary adoption collaboration government incentive goal fair transparent accountable public private sector local infrastructure aige akin airspace law airplane nazree china malaysia learn united regard regulation industry regulator manage risk capability system threshold model computational power move potential danger technological progress strategy malaysia regulatory framework azree cybersecurity consultant fong choong fook aige regulation government govern ethic law difficult fluidity variable malaysia dabble future development usage time code ethic enable ethic aige principle reliability safety control privacy security inclusiveness transparency accountability pursuit human benefit happiness fairness principle development avoid bias discrimination target user principle system consent usage data top priority principle privacy security constant consistent certification risk impact assessment system size approach widest range factor age gender religion ethnicity transparency pertinent context decision algorithm transparent technical process human decision accountability principle caters human value quality life system undermine human autonomy governance mechanism,"[(13, 0.9957161)]",13

730336,StarBiz,4,19/09/2024,Soft skills in an AI future,,"HOW ready and equipped are today’s young Filipinos for the jobs of the future? 
 We’re already in a new era where artificial intelligence (AI) promises to be all around us, running smart machines including transport vehicles; doing much of the work of doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other professionals; and much more. 
 With so many types of jobs seemingly at risk from wide application of AI, will our “demographic sweet spot,” or abundant supply of workers (versus ageing populations in most other countries), be an asset, or will it be a burden in our future economy? 
 What skills will they need in order to find a productive role in the workplaces of the future?
 A new study from the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) authored by Allan Bernardo, Jose Ramon Albert, Jana Flor Vizmanos, and Mika Munoz warns that lack of “soft skills” makes Filipino youth ill-prepared for the challenges of AI and other emerging technologies characterising the Fourth Industrial Revolution that’s now upon us. 
 This will impact not only on their individual career prospects, but will also impair our economy’s stability, competitiveness, and innovation potential.
 What do we mean by soft skills? 
 These are personal attributes and interpersonal abilities that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with others. 
 Unlike hard skills, which are technical and job-specific, soft skills are more about how one works and interacts with workmates. 
 They are critical for success in the workplace and applicable across different jobs and industries. 
 Included in soft skills are communication (clearly expressing ideas and listening to others), teamwork (working well with others to achieve a common goal), problem-solving (identifying and resolving issues efficiently), adaptability (being flexible and open to change), emotional intelligence (managing one’s own emotions and understanding those of others), time management (prioritising tasks and managing time effectively), leadership (guiding, motivating, inspiring others), and conflict resolution (handling disputes constructively). 
 These are not taught as subjects in school; they are learned through experience, interactions, and relationships with others.
 Job-skills mismatch
 Years ago, I led a team analysing the job-skills mismatch in a project of the Philippine Business for Education, where we interviewed various industrial firms in different parts of the country, along with officials of colleges and universities accessible to them. 
 We were often told by hiring managers that their applicants’ training in the hard skills of science and engineering was usually not the decisive factor in their decision to hire or not to hire someone. 
 They reasoned that specific technical skills could be provided through on-the-job training after the worker is hired. 
 But it was their soft skills that usually swung their hiring decision, and the ability to communicate well and to collaborate in teams were among those most cited.
 Soft skills will be critically important for workers in the era of AI. 
 While workers will need the hard skills for navigating new tools and systems, soft skills will complement them by fostering adaptability and human-centered problem-solving, which machines can never replace. 
 Human creativity
 AI can do the data-driven tasks, but it is human creativity and ability to think outside the box that leads to breakthroughs.
 The PIDS paper argues that “addressing this (soft skills) gap requires a concerted effort from educational institutions, policymakers, and industry leaders to redefine skills development frameworks and prioritise the cultivation of these essential competencies.” 
 It must also be recognised that the solution to the soft skills gap in our country hinges not on tertiary education alone, be it in technical and vocational education and training (TVET), or in college degree programmes. 
 Soft skills are instilled long before students enter TVET or higher education institutions – if they do at all. 
 Basic education
 It goes back to basic education in the elementary and high school levels, where children subconsciously imbibe these soft skills not in their school subjects but through their learning experiences in school, at home, and in the community.
 In sum, it’s not just about what our young people learn. 
 Equally important is how they learn. 
 Since learning does not only happen in classrooms, this is a concern not just for teachers and principals, but also for parents and family members, and the community where the child grows. 
 “It takes a village to raise a child,” as the saying goes – and this is most true in honing the child’s crucial soft skills. 
 This is also why education must be contextualised in our young people’s particular community situations, and this bolsters the case for decentralised and devolved management of our education system. 
 A centralised and top-down approach simply won’t get it right. — The Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN

729728,Main,6,18/09/2024,"Use AI to ease traffic congestion, says Ahmad Maslan",,"JOHOR BARU: All 33 highway concessionaires in the country should utilise artificial intelligence (AI) to address traffic congestion, particularly during long weekends and public holidays, says Deputy Works Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan.
 He said the companies should take advantage of available technology instead of blaming the traffic snarl on the increasing number of vehicles.
 “One of the current solutions is the introduction of smart lanes where vehicles are allowed to use the emergency lane. I hope we can increase the number of smart lanes from the current 18 lanes we have nationwide.
 “Another solution is the use of the My Travel Time Advisory (My-TTA) by PLUS Malaysia Bhd, which helps travellers decide when to begin their journey to avoid traffic jams,” he said.
 However, he said that more sustainable methods should be tried out. 
 “We cannot solely rely on smart lanes, as their travel distance is short. And congestion will still occur during public holidays and long weekends,” he told reporters after the opening ceremony of the Highway Concession Conference  2024 yesterday. 
 Ahmad said that highway concessionaires could also introduce compulsory exits, particularly in cases of accidents or severe congestion.
 “Perhaps we could add more smart lanes or extend the operating hours of existing ones.
 “We may also consider introducing a contra-flow lane, where one lane on the less busy side of the road is closed to allow vehicles on the busier side to pass more easily,” he said.
 On another matter, Ahmad said the ministry was hoping to introduce a third phase of the expansion project on the North-South Expressway (NSE) from Simpang Renggam to Yong Peng Utara.
 The third phase, he said would cover about 41km, with an estimated development cost of RM1bil.
 Ahmad said he hoped that the Finance Ministry would announce a special allocation for the project during the tabling of Budget 2025 next month.
 “The first phase of the expansion has already begun, involving the widening of the road from four to six lanes between Senai Utara and Sedenak, costing RM525mil,” he added.
 As for the second phase which stretched from Sedenak to Simpang Renggam, he said it would cost RM505mil as announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim last year.
 He said the third phase could be divided into two stages – from Simpang Renggam to Ayer Hitam next year, followed by Ayer Hitam to Yong Peng Utara the following year.
 “This way, we can split the RM1bil cost into RM500mil per year,” he added.",johor concessionaire country artificial intelligence address traffic congestion public holiday deputy minister datuk seri ahmad maslan company technology traffic snarl vehicle current solution introduction smart lane vehicle emergency lane smart lane current lane nationwide solution travel time advisory tta malaysia bhd traveller journey avoid traffic jam sustainable method smart lane distance short congestion public holiday weekend reporter highway concession conference yesterday highway concessionaire compulsory exit accident severe congestion smart lane operating hour contra flow lane lane busy road vehicle ahmad ministry introduce phase expansion project north south expressway nse simpang renggam peng utara phase cover development cost bil ahmad finance ministry special allocation project budget month phase expansion road lane utara sedenak mil phase sedenak simpang renggam cost mil prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim phase stage renggam ayer hitam ayer hitam peng utara split bil cost mil,"[(7, 0.9928186)]",7
729966,StarBiz,8,18/09/2024,Intel to make custom AI chip for Amazon,Firm committed to US ops as German plant delayed,"SAN FRANCISCO: Intel Corp chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger (pic) has landed Amazon.com Inc’s AWS as a customer for the company’s manufacturing business, potentially bringing work to new plants under construction in the United States and boosting his efforts to turn around the embattled chipmaker. 
 Intel and AWS will co-invest in a custom semiconductor for artificial intelligence (AI) computing – what’s known as a fabric chip – in a “multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework,” according to a statement on Monday.
 The work will rely on Intel’s 18A process, an advanced chipmaking technology.
 The shares jumped almost 10% in late trading after the announcement. They had been down 58% this year, closing at US$20.91.
 “Today’s announcement is big,” Gelsinger said in an interview. “This is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities.”
 The news was part of a flurry of announcements that followed a pivotal board meeting last week. Intel also is postponing new factories in Germany and Poland, but remains committed to its US expansion in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio.
 Gelsinger, who embarked on a bold comeback effort for Intel in 2021, has had to scale back some of his ambitions in the name of efficiency. 
 With sales shrinking and losses piling up, the company announced plans last month to slash 15,000 workers, find US$10bil in cost savings and suspend Intel’s dividend. Now he’s going further to rein in expansion plans, especially overseas.
 The Poland and Germany construction projects will be paused for about two years depending on market demand. 
 Another one in Malaysia will be completed but only put into operation when conditions support it, Intel said.
 At last week’s three-day board meeting, executives presented options on how to conserve cash while keeping Gelsinger’s turnaround plan on track. 
 The CEO’s effort hinges on transforming Intel into a so-called foundry, a chipmaker that manufacturers products for outside customers. 
 The Santa Clara, California-based company has been slow to line up customers for the project – and a high-profile client such as Amazon represents a notable win.
 Intel also is looking to speed up efforts to execute the US$10bil in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing, an area where rival Nvidia Corp has excelled.
 AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, and it could help build confidence that Intel can compete with the likes of foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 
 AWS has used Intel processors over the years, but has been shifting more toward in-house designs – the very products that Intel may now help manufacture.
 Microsoft Corp, another major cloud-computing provider, announced plans in February to use Intel for some of its in-house chips as well.
 Another change: Intel’s foundry operations, referred to as IFS, will be further separated from the rest of the company and become a wholly owned subsidiary. 
 That move is aimed in part at convincing prospective customers – some of whom compete with Intel – that they are dealing with an independent supplier.
 “We still have things to learn about becoming a foundry,” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I need lots of customers.”
 In another win, Intel said earlier Monday that it’s eligible to receive as much as US$3bil in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military. 
 The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defence and intelligence purposes. 
 That news helped send the shares up 6.4% in regular trading Monday.
 Intel still has a long way to go to win back Wall Street’s confidence. 
 After years of losing ground to rivals and seeing its technological edge slip, the Silicon Valley pioneer is valued at less than US$90bil.
 It no longer ranks as one of the top 10 chipmakers on that basis. 
 Nvidia, meanwhile, now has a market capitalisation of about US$2.9 trillion.
 Intel shocked investors with a bleak financial report last month, triggering the biggest single-day stock decline in decades.

729988,StarBiz,9,18/09/2024,Hong Kong considering  rules for AI use in finance,Affluent hub seeks to signal support for emerging tech,"Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government is preparing to issue its maiden policy statement on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could catalyse the use of the technology in areas from trading to investment banking and cryptocurrencies.
 The city’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau plans to issue a framework of guidelines to touch on the ethical use of AI and general principles for applying the technology in the finance world, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. 
 Officials are still drafting the document while getting feedback from the industry, the people said. 
 Details are still subject to change in the coming weeks, they added.
 While specifics remain unclear, the document is broadly intended to signal Hong Kong’s support for AI, as governments around the world come to grips with the technology’s potential. 
 Local regulators are also trying to resolve some of the confusion around AI in Hong Kong, a city that’s caught up in the US-Chinese technology conflict. 
 Many consumers and corporations can’t easily access some of the hottest services from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Google’s Gemini, because US tech leaders are likely nervous about running afoul of the Chinese territory’s rules, analysts said.
 Officials expect to unveil their statement around late October during Fintech Week, one of the industry’s most important annual gatherings. 
 “The government and the financial regulators are closely monitoring market developments and global experiences in order to promote the responsible use of AI in the financial industry,” a spokesman for the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said in a statement. 
 “The government will issue a policy statement later this year, setting out its policy stance and approach on the application of AI in the financial market,” the spokesman added.
 Hong Kong wants to re-position the affluent city as a financial centre, as foreign investors grow nervous about Beijing’s growing control and consider alternative locations such as Singapore. 
 The South-East Asian nation has forged ahead in crafting guidance on everything from crypto to fintech and AI.
 At the same time, Wall Street is exploring ways AI might reshape financial firms’ operations. 
 Banks globally have been advertising to lure AI talent and are using emerging technologies for tasks such as examining client portfolios and looking for potential defaulters.
 A policy statement would provide broad direction and wouldn’t be immediately enforceable. 
 Still, such statements have become a popular way for the Hong Kong administration to declare its commitment to new and competitive policy areas such as Web3 and family offices. 
 The anticipated statement suggests regulators will adopt a favourable attitude toward AI applications and will later release more concrete rules, the people said. 
 The policy statement is intended also to consolidate various detailed guidance from individual banking and securities regulators, according to the people.  — Bloomberg",hong kong government issue maiden policy statement artificial intelligence finance people familiar matter move catalyse technology trading investment banking cryptocurrencies city financial service treasury bureau plan framework guideline ethical principle technology finance people private official document feedback industry people detail subject week specific unclear document signal hong kong support government grip technology potential local regulator confusion hong kong city chinese technology conflict consumer corporation access hottest service chatgpt google gemini tech leader nervous afoul chinese territory rule analyst official unveil statement late october fintech week industry annual gathering government financial regulator market development global experience responsible financial industry spokesman financial service treasury bureau statement government issue policy statement policy stance approach application financial market spokesman kong position affluent city financial centre foreign investor nervous control alternative location south east asian nation guidance crypto fintech time wall street reshape financial firm operation bank lure talent technology task client portfolio potential defaulter policy statement broad direction enforceable statement popular kong administration declare commitment competitive policy family office statement regulator favourable attitude application concrete rule people policy statement consolidate guidance individual banking security regulator people,"[(10, 0.34470877), (12, 0.6505529)]",12

729414,StarBiz,13,17/09/2024,Chip startup Groq backs Saudi AI ambitions,,"Riyadh: Artificial intelligence (AI) startup Groq Inc has partnered with oil producer Aramco to build a giant data centre in Saudi Arabia that it hopes will become a hub for companies running AI systems across the Middle East, Africa and India.
 The California-based startup will operate what it has said will be the world’s largest AI inferencing centre that initially has 19,000 language processing units (LPUs), while Aramco will fund the development that is expected to cost “in the order of nine figures”, Groq chief executive officer Jonathan Ross said in an interview in Riyadh. The data centre will be up and running by the end of this year, and could later expand to include a total of 200,000 language processing units, Ross said
 Groq has partnered with Aramco Digital, a new unit of the world’s largest oil producer intended to help Aramco harness AI to help its core energy business while also facilitating other firms to use AI. 
 Aramco is “planning to do massive capital deployments for this, and it is a way to help diversify the economy away from oil,” Ross said. 
 By building the data centre in Saudi Arabia, Groq aims to capitalise on the country’s low energy costs, availability of land, and access to four billion people within a 100 millisecond ping – a measure of how quickly data can travel between processing location and users.
 Saudi Arabia wants to become a hub for technology industries like AI as it seeks ways to modernise its economy and boost other sources of income besides oil. 
 Yet some of its growth plans have been hampered by US government restrictions on exports of the latest AI chips, which has limited the availability of the latest chips developed by Nvidia Corp.
 Groq said it does not expect to face any US government restrictions on its plans to boost its presence in Saudi Arabia, including establishing a regional headquarters in Riyadh.
 “We’ve been very open with US Commerce Department about our intent to deploy here,” Ross said. 
 Groq could look at working with the Saudi oil producer on other projects in the future, Ross said. 
 “The expectation is that we’re going to partner with Aramco Digitial for quite a bit of our deployment in this region and anywhere we can,” he said. 
 “They’ve been a great partner so we would work with them anywhere we could.” 
 The inferencing data centre will use Groq’s LPU AI inference technology, advanced AI processors designed specifically for massive-scale inference workloads that deliver speed and efficiency. 
 In the past six months alone, nearly half a million AI developers have adopted Groq inference cloud solutions. 
 The partnership in Saudi Arabia is expected to set the new compute standard for AI inference data centres around the world, and marks progress towards the Groq mission to develop AI inference compute centers around the globe.
 The partnership aims to revolutionise data processing and analytics across various sectors. 
 The facility will process billions of tokens per day by the end of 2024 and be able to onboard hundreds of thousands of developers in the region and then hundreds of billions of tokens per day with millions of developers by 2025. 
 Tareq Amin, chief excutive of Aramco Digital, said, “With the support of the kingdom’s leadership, we are proud to partner with Groq to develop a world-leading inferencing data center in Saudi Arabia.

729306,Lifestyle,6,16/09/2024,AI invokes awe and anxiety,Wonder and trepidation as AI transforms smartphones with powerful yet potentially troubling features.,"MATTHEW Day was keen to find out if an artificial intelligence-packed Google Pixel 9 smartphone could tell him a great local fishing spot.
 California Assemblywoman Gail Pellerin of the United States whipped up a playful picture of her dog in front of the state capitol building.
 Igor Gaspar launched into a discussion with the Pixel regarding causes of inflation.
 Fascination tinged with concern was a common reaction as people in Santa Cruz dabbled with a Pixel 9 and its capabilities, including the ability to “add” oneself to pictures and having a whip-smart digital assistant at one’s command.
 Passersby in the coastal California city were asked to test out the phone’s features as Google and Apple increasingly integrate AI into their products, marking what they describe as a transformative time for devices central to modern life.
 “I asked it a question, and it gave me a quick answer,” Day said as he checked out the Pixel 9.
 “That’s a lot better than the phone I have right now, I’ll tell you that much.”
 “(There are) definitely some incredible tools that people would have available to them to do creative things and gather information,” Pellerin said after putting a Pixel through its paces.
 Yet worries also mounted.
 “But I’m also concerned about nefarious uses of it, and we need to have those guardrails and regulations so it doesn’t cause havoc in any industries or communities or whatever,” she added.
 Pellerin is backing state legislation aimed at thwarting AI being used for misinformation and deepfakes.
 Along with her concerns was admiration, though, for the benefits of AI features such as an “Add Me” tool that lets people take a photo of family or friends, then add themselves in as though they were part of the group from the outset.
 “I could see myself, as these tools become available, utilising them more and more,” she said of AI on smartphones.“It’s scary. It’s going to only increase the desperation that comes if we have to live without them.”
 Bells and whistles?
 University of California, Santa Cruz, computer science professor Leilani Gilpin questioned the need to put AI in people’s pockets and wondered whether confident- sounding smartphone replies will mask moments when the software is “hallucinating” – making up inaccurate information.
 “Different language models hallucinate different information,” Gilpin said.
 “So, the same thing is going to happen for people using this,” she added, hefting the smartphone.
 “Whether it’s for trivia or for generating images or other things, there’ll be some made-up information, and that’s just a way that the models work.”
 Gilpin liked the idea of engaging with AI conversationally while out walking, but felt spoken exchanges lacked a sense of talking with a real person.
 “I work on a lot of these technologies, so I feel like it’s a couple of bells and whistles on things I’ve seen before,” Gilpin said.
 “I don’t think it’s going to be super revolutionary.”
 Gilpin and others also found the smartphone AI to be verbose, diving deeply into topics when short replies would suffice.
 Meanwhile, Gaspar and some friends created a group photo using the Pixel “Add Me” feature, with that capability alone prompting one of them to offer to swap phones.
 “It was a really impressive feature,” 23-year-old Gaspar said.
 “But, with the information war we have, I think a lot of people could be kind of scared by the futuristic aspect of things – like you can add me to a picture in a way that’s real.”
 Seeing powerful AI tools on new smartphones “raises eyebrows” for Gaspar, who said having them packed into iPhones could spoil his taste for Apple products unless he feels in complete control of the technology.
 “I wouldn’t feel comfortable with having something that’s so advanced that we aren’t even sure of how it works on our phones,” Gaspar said.
 “I do love Apple products, but if there’s going to be this shift towards artificial intelligence without a choice of the consumer, I would step away from that.”
 In some ways, companies are already trying to avoid negative fallout from infusing AI into their products.
 Google appeared to be taking steps to avoid controversy, with its Gemini AI-powered digital assistant on the Pixel declining to talk about elections or politics and the image generation tool telling users it would not depict real people. – AFP",matthew day artificial intelligence google pixel smartphone local fishing spot california assemblywoman gail pellerin whipped playful picture dog front capitol building igor gaspar discussion pixel inflation fascination concern common reaction people cruz pixel capability ability picture smart digital assistant command passersby coastal california city test phone feature apple integrate product transformative time device central modern life question quick answer day pixel lot phone incredible tool people pellerin pixel pace worry concerned nefarious guardrail regulation industry community legislation misinformation deepfakes concern admiration benefit feature tool people family friend outset tool smartphones scary increase desperation live bell university california santa cruz computer science professor leilani gilpin people pocket confident smartphone reply moment software inaccurate language model gilpin happen people smartphone trivia image model idea exchange sense real person lot technology couple bell gilpin super revolutionary gilpin smartphone verbose deeply topic short reply gaspar friend photo pixel feature capability offer swap phone impressive feature gaspar war lot people futuristic aspect picture real powerful tool raise gaspar iphones spoil taste apple product feel complete control technology feel comfortable advanced phone apple product artificial intelligence choice consumer step company negative fallout product google step avoid controversy gemini digital assistant pixel talk election politics image generation tool user depict real people,"[(3, 0.5913747), (10, 0.4042672)]",3
729012,Lifestyle,21,15/09/2024,Turning the tide with AI,"Armed with AI-driven forecasts and cash assistance, Nigerian farmers take steps to safeguard their farms before floods strike.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) and traditional aid are helping farmers like Salihu Ali in northern Nigeria act before their farms are submerged by increasingly regular floods fuelled by climate change.
 Ali was warned that floods were coming in 2022 and was provided with cash to prepare his farm in Dasin Hausa, a remote village of cowpea, maize, and rice farmers in Adamawa state.
 In response, he harvested his maize early and moved the barn where he kept seedlings and fertiliser uphill.
 “We (farmers) contributed money to buy canoes to transport our crops, seedlings, fertilisers and other farm inputs when the water became too high,” Ali said.
 He was among 1,450 families who were given US$450 (RM1,950) in the pilot project, which relied on AI to develop flood forecasting models based on large amounts of data, ranging from satellite information to historical events to river levels.
 The project, run by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a non-governmental humanitarian organisation, in partnership with Google.org, the tech giant’s philanthropic arm, has now been renewed and expanded with a cash injection of US$4.6mil (RM19.9mil) from Google to IRC and the non-profit GiveDirectly.
 The idea is simple: harness AI to predict floods before they happen and give communities cash before the waters rise so they can prepare their farms and limit the damage to their homes.
 Forecasts from Google’s AI tool Flood Hub and data from national authorities will be used to strengthen early warning systems and trigger payouts to 7,500 people in flood-prone areas in the northern Adamawa and Kogi states.
 Google’s Flood Hub uses open-source data, including weather forecasts and satellite imagery, to predict floods up to seven days in advance.
 Food security
 Warming temperatures due to climate change are increasing the intensity and frequency of Africa’s rains, according to United Nations climate experts.
 Extreme weather events are undermining food security in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. But early warning systems can help reduce fatalities and mitigate the risk of widespread hunger caused by regular floods.
 The floods in 2022 destroyed 770,000 hectares of farmland and submerged thousands of homes across several Nigerian states. More than 600 people were killed, and at least two million people had to flee their homes.
 But the damage could have been worse.
 A few weeks before the rains came, researchers from IRC’s Airbel Impact Lab prepared flood forecasts using hydrological and meteorological data gathered from its flood monitoring system and Nigeria’s meteorological agency.
 Clare Clingain, research coordinator at the Airbel Impact Lab, said they shared the information with local authorities and IRC workers in Nigeria, who organised meetings and distributed flyers to warn residents.
 “When designing anticipatory action, everything is based on a forecast, and you want to make sure that forecast is reliable and accurate,” Clingain said.
 Redefining aid response
 In Adamawa, more than half of the farmers who received cash said they used the money to harvest crops early, elevate storage barns from flood paths and stockpile food, according to the IRC’s evaluation report.
 The forecasts drew on data from the European Union’s Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), an AI model that uses satellite flood detection algorithms, in addition to information from Nigeria’s meteorological and emergency agencies.
 The IRC says it will now use forecasts from Google’s Flood Hub and a combination of other tools to get accurate predictions.
 Clingain said accuracy was key to persuading farmers to act. In the past, forecasts have been unreliable, or warnings sometimes came too late for farmers, or aid agencies to act.
 Alex Diaz, head of AI for social good at Google.org, said timing was also critical.
 “If you get an early warning a day before, that might save your life, but if you get it five days to a week in advance, that can save your livelihood when you have the cash to help you do that,” he said.
 GiveDirectly, which makes cash transfers to the phones of people living in poverty, has also tested the approach in Mozambique.AI tools can help bridge gaps in gathering weather-related data, while early forecasts help aid agencies redefine their disaster responses, said Vera Lummis, a senior manager of digital innovation at GiveDirectly.
 “The traditional way of delivering disaster aid is that it’s done after a disaster, but unfortunately, in a lot of cases, cash assistance or aid many times doesn’t reach families affected (until) months after a disaster,” she said.

727944,Main,5,12/09/2024,"Be careful with AI in elections, say political parties",,"PETALING JAYA: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) looks set to play a major role in the US election campaign, several politicians here are advising caution about its use in the 16th General Election (GE16), especially with its potential to spread disinformation and deepfakes.
 With AI now capable of creating realistic text-to-speech and voice-emulation deepfakes, the stakes are very high, said Barisan Nasional secretary-general Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
 “We are worried about AI-driven political networks which are used to spread fantasy, fiction and mass delusion.
 “Barisan suffered heavily in (the) 2018 (elections) due to fake news. Our attempts to address this with the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 about a month before the elections failed to convince voters of the threats posed by fake news.
 “Consequently, the Pakatan Harapan government also faced similar issues.
 “In the next elections, new tools like AI will be used, but we must not be driven by free-for-all campaigning without values and morals,” he told The Star.
 In July last year, an influencer was investigated after an AI-generated clip emerged depicting Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow allegedly announcing a new policy to enable single men to find women.
 In December last year, a video purportedly depicting former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob delivering a national address in fluent Tagalog, also made its rounds on social media. 
 On Aug 29, Terengganu PAS Youth lodged a police report over an AI-generated image mocking the state government over its stance on female athletes’ attire. 
 The image showed a person wearing a black burqa while diving into a swimming pool, captioned “Welcome to Afganu!”. 
 PKR communications director Lee Chean Chung said there was a need for a code of ethics when using AI and greater accountability by social media platforms.
 He said he would advocate for the labelling of AI-generated content in GE16 to improve transparency.
 “People are already vulnerable to human-driven scams and crimes,” he said, adding that better tools and more robust cybersecurity measures are needed to detect AI abuse.
 PAS central working committee member Khairil Nizam Khirudin said the party was open to technological developments but stressed the importance of truth in social media use.
 “If AI has more downsides, especially in spreading fake news and slander, then PAS will reject it. We have seen AI-generated fake content targeting the Terengganu government recently,” he said.
 He urged the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to act swiftly, adding that the regulator must be fair in such cases.
 On whether PAS will use AI in its GE16 campaigns, Khairil Nizam said that it would depend on election rules.
 “If permitted, Perikatan Nasional will use AI technology based on truth, not slander,” he said.
 Muda information chief Leben Siddharth acknowledged AI’s growing role in electoral processes, with applications ranging from targeted campaigning to voter engagement and management.
 “Muda is open to utilising AI tools responsibly to enhance our political campaigns and outreach efforts.
 “However, Muda is concerned about the potential for AI to spread misinformation.

728116,StarBiz,4,12/09/2024,Will AI hit employment and increase inequality?,,"THE release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has raised great hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) can contribute to solving problems in many fields and lift productivity, but also fears that many jobs may disappear, and that income inequality could rise further.
 AI is commonly seen as a general-purpose technology, like the internal combustion engine, early electricity-based technologies, and computers. 
 Such technologies have the potential to disrupt large parts of the economy, displacing many workers. 
 Every wave of innovation in history has generated fears of “technological unemployment” but so far economies have generally succeeded in creating more jobs than those that were destroyed, even though transition phases have often been painful.
 Automation generally leads to productivity gains, which generate income that can be spent on new products and services, which in turn creates demand for labour. 
 Employment in difficult to automate activities rises with aggregate demand and new occupations are being created. 
 David Autor, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and co-authors find that about 60% of 2018 US jobs did not exist in 1940. 
 Reallocation of labour associated with technological change challenges workers, who often need reskilling and upskilling.
 Structural change may also be associated with macroeconomic and financial instability if economies struggle to adapt. 
 The income distribution is affected, as illustrated by the polarisation of labour markets in many advanced economies over the past decades.
 Will labour market developments in the AI era follow historical patterns, or will AI be a game changer?
 Like many digital tools before it, AI offers large potential for deployment across a wide range of economic activities. 
 Until recently, mainly routine tasks could be automated. 
 AI offers possibilities to automate non-routine cognitive tasks, thanks to its ability to learn by itself from huge datasets and integrate tacit knowledge. 
 Some researchers believe that machines could ultimately outperform humans in almost all activities. Nevertheless, even if one believes such prophecies, they are probably far away in the future. 
 At the current juncture, AI can automate some cognitive tasks and complement humans in performing more complex ones.
 Several studies have investigated different occupations’ exposure to AI, by linking some AI applications to skills used in specific professions. 
 This is a good starting point for thinking about the potential impact of AI on jobs, productivity, and inequality. 
 Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD) Global Forum on Productivity suggests that jobs in knowledge-intensive services, such as finance, advertising, consulting, and information and communication are the most likely to be affected by AI. 
 Conversely, workers in industries like mining and construction, or relatively low knowledge-intensity services, such as administration and support, transportation, and water and waste, have limited exposure to AI. This has prompted fears that technological development, after automating routine tasks, which affected mainly blue-collar workers, would go on to automate even knowledge-intensive tasks, threatening the jobs of high-skilled workers.
 Crucial question
 A crucial question is whether AI can mainly automate tasks or whether it also has potential to augment workers’ abilities to perform their jobs. 
 In other words, whether AI is mostly a substitute or a complement to human labour. 
 According to a World Economic Forum report, both aspects are important, and their strength varies across economic sectors. Tasks are considered automatable if they do not require creatively solving ambiguous problems, working with others in real time or validating outputs. 
 The potential for augmentation of worker capabilities is particularly high in knowledge-intensity services. 
 For example, in information and technology services, nearly 32% of the time spent on all tasks could be subject to automation, but the potential for augmentation is even higher, reaching almost 37% of the time spent on all tasks. 
 In media and publishing, the potential for augmentation dominates that of automation even more, at 32% versus 24% of the time spent on all tasks.
 Hence, while AI is likely to displace some workers, it will also boost the productivity of others. 
 Medical diagnosis
 To give more concrete examples, while AI can improve medical diagnosis and help build legal cases, it is unlikely to replace physicians and lawyers anytime soon. 
 AI provides skilled professionals with new valuable tools, but in many circumstances, human intervention is still necessary, especially in high-stakes decisions, not least because AI is sometimes subject to hallucinations, producing inaccurate or misleading results.
 Recent studies point to significant improvements in workers’ performance due to AI in some specific tasks, ranging from 14% in customer services to 56%  in coding. 
 This suggests that if AI were to be widely adopted across the economy, productivity may rise substantially. 
 But translating micro-level performance into economy-wide productivity is challenging. 
 Productivity boost
 Estimates of AI’s potential labour productivity boost over the next decade in advanced economies generally vary from about 0.1 to more than 2.5 percentage points per year. 
 To put these numbers into perspective, US non-farm labour productivity grew at an average annual rate of 2.1% between 1947 and 2023, and 1.5% since 2006. 
 Hence, according to the most optimistic estimates, AI would lift productivity growth well-above historical trends. 
 Median estimates would bring labour productivity growth close the 3% observed between 1996 and 2005, during the deployment of the Internet. 
 However, other studies suggest this may be too optimistic. 
 AI-related productivity gains are likely to vary across countries. 
 South Korea is well placed to be among the main beneficiaries, thanks to its high level of digital development and strong position in the global semiconductor market. — The Korea Herald/ANN

727298,Main,16,10/09/2024,Summit to set AI military ‘blueprint’,International meeting aims to set rules and principles for responsible use,"THE republic convened an international summit seeking to establish a blueprint for the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the military, though any agreement is not expected to have binding powers to enforce it.More than 90 countries, inclu­ding the United States and China, have sent government represen­tatives to the two-day summit in Seoul, which is the second such gathering.
 At the first summit held in Amsterdam last year, the United States, China and other nations endorsed a modest “call to action” without legal commitment.
 “Recently, in the Russia-Ukraine war, an AI-applied Ukrainian drone functioned as David’s slingshot,” South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun said in an opening address yesterday.
 He was referring to Ukraine’s efforts for a technological edge against Russia by rolling out AI-enabled drones, hoping they will help overcome signal jamming as well as enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to work in larger groups.
 “As AI is applied to the military domain, the military’s operational capabilities are dramatically imp­ro­ved. However, it is like a double-edged sword, as it can cause damage from abuse,” Kim said.
 South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said discussions would cover areas such as a legal review to ensure compliance with international law and mechanisms to prevent autonomous weapons from making life-and-death decisions without appropriate human oversight.
 The Seoul summit hoped to agree to a blueprint for action, establishing a minimum level of guard-rails for AI in the military and suggesting principles on responsible use by reflecting principles laid out by Nato, the US or a number of other countries, accor­ding to a senior South Korean official.
 It was unclear how many nations attending the summit would endorse the document today, which is aiming to be a more detailed attempt to set boundaries on AI use in the military, but still likely lack legal commitments.
 The summit is not the only international set of discussions on AI use in the military.
 UN countries that belong to the 1983 Convention on Certain Con­ven­tional Weapons (CCW) are discussing potential restrictions on lethal autonomous weapons systems for compliance with international humanitarian law.
 The US government last year also launched a declaration on responsible use of AI in the military, which covers broader military application of AI, beyond weapons.
 As of August, 55 countries  have endorsed the declaration.  — Reuters",republic international summit blueprint responsible artificial intelligence military agreement power enforce country united china government represen tatives day summit seoul summit united china nation modest call action legal commitment russia ukraine war ukrainian drone david slingshot south korean defence minister kim hyun address yesterday ukraine effort technological edge russia drone overcome signal jamming enable unmanned aerial vehicle larger military domain military operational capability sword damage abuse kim south korean foreign minister cho tae yul discussion legal review compliance international law autonomous weapon life death decision human oversight seoul summit agree blueprint action minimum level guard military suggesting principle responsible principle nato country senior south korean official unclear nation summit document detailed attempt boundary military lack legal commitment international set discussion military country convention con ven tional weapon potential restriction autonomous weapon system compliance international humanitarian law government declaration responsible military cover military application weapon august country declaration reuters,"[(4, 0.99318475)]",4
726728,Main,24,08/09/2024,China is closing the AI gap with the United States,,"AT the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai in July, startup founder Qu Dongqi showed off a video he had recently posted online. It displayed an old photograph of a woman with two toddlers. Then the photo sprang to life as the woman lifted the toddlers up in her arms and they laughed with surprise.
 The video was created by AI technology from Chinese internet company Kuaishou. The technology was reminiscent of a video generator, called Sora, that American startup OpenAI unveiled this year. But unlike Sora, it was available to the general public.
 “My American friends still can’t use Sora,” Qu said. “But we already have better solutions here.”
 While the United States has had a head start on AI development, China is catching up. In recent weeks, several Chinese companies have unveiled AI technologies that rival leading American systems. And these technologies are already in the hands of consumers, businesses and independent software developers across the globe.
 While many American companies are worried that AI technologies could accelerate the spread of disinformation or cause other serious harm, Chinese companies are more willing to release their technologies to consumers or even share the underlying software code with other businesses and software developers. This kind of sharing of computer code, called open source, allows others to more quickly build and distribute their own products using the same technologies.
 Open source has been a cornerstone of the development of computer software, the internet and, now, artificial intelligence. The idea is that technology advances faster when its computer code is freely available for anyone to examine, use and improve upon.
 China’s efforts could have enormous implications as AI technology continues to develop in the years to come. The technology could increase the productivity of workers, fuel future innovations and power a new wave of military technologies, including autonomous weapons.
 When OpenAI kicked off the AI boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT, China struggled to compete with technologies emerging from American companies such as OpenAI and Google. But China’s progress is now accelerating.
 Kuaishou released its video generator, Kling, in China in June and to users worldwide on July 29. 
 Just before Kling’s arrival, 01.AI, a startup co-founded by Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and technologist who helped build Chinese offices for both Google and Microsoft, released chatbot technology that scored nearly as well as the leading American technologies on common benchmark tests that rate the performance of the world’s chatbots.
 New technology from Chinese tech giant Alibaba has also leaped to the top of a leaderboard that rates open-source AI systems. “We have disproved the commonplace belief that China doesn’t have the talent or the technology to compete with the US,” Lee said. “That belief is simply wrong.”
 In interviews, a dozen technologists and researchers at Chinese tech companies said open-source technologies were a key reason that China’s AI development has advanced so quickly. They saw open-source AI as an opportunity for the country to take a lead.
 But that will not be easy. The US remains at the forefront of AI research. And US officials have resolved to keep it that way.
 The White House has instituted a trade embargo designed to prevent Chinese companies from using the most powerful versions of computer chips that are essential to building artificial intelligence. A group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would make it easier for the White House to control the export of AI software built in the US.  Others are trying to limit the progress of open-source technologies that have helped fuel the rise of similar systems in China.
 The top American companies are also exploring new technologies that aim to eclipse the powers of today’s chatbots and video generators.
 “Chinese companies are good at replicating and improving what the US already has,” said Yiran Chen, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University in North Carolina. “They are not as good at inventing something completely new that will bypass the US in five to 10 years.”
 But many in China’s tech industry believe that open-source technology could help them grow despite those constraints. And if US regulators stifle the progress of American open-source projects (as some lawmakers are discussing) China could gain a significant edge. If the best open-source technologies come from China, US developers could end up building their systems atop Chinese technologies.
 “Open-source AI is the foundation of AI development,” said Clément Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a company that houses many of the world’s open-source AI projects. The US built its leadership in AI through collaboration between companies and researchers, he said, “and it looks like China could do the same thing.”
 AI systems require enormous resources: talent, data and computing power. Beijing has made it clear that the benefits accruing from such investments should be shared. The Chinese government has poured money into AI projects and subsidised resources like computing centers.
 But Chinese tech companies face a major constraint on the development of their AI systems: compliance with Beijing’s strict censorship regime, which extends to generative AI technologies.
 Kuaishou’s new video generator Kling appears to have been trained to follow the rules. Text prompts with any mention of China’s president, Xi Jinping, or controversial topics such as feminism and the country’s real estate crisis yielded error messages. An image prompt of this year’s National People’s Congress yielded a video of the delegates shifting in their seats.
 Kuaishou did not respond to questions about what steps the company took to prevent Kling from creating harmful, fake or politically sensitive content.
 By making their most advanced AI technologies freely available, China’s tech giants are demonstrating their willingness to contribute to the country’s overall technological advancement as Beijing has established that the power and profit of the tech industry should be channeled toward the goal of self sufficiency.
 The concern for some in China is that the country will struggle to amass the computing chips it needs to build increasingly powerful technologies. But that has not yet prevented Chinese companies from building powerful new technologies that can compete with US systems. — ©2024 The New York Times Company",artificial intelligence conference shanghai july startup founder dongqi video online photograph woman toddler sprang life woman toddler arm surprise video technology chinese internet company kuaishou technology reminiscent video generator sora american startup openai sora public american friend sora solution united head start development china week chinese company technology leading american system technology consumer business independent software developer american company technology spread disinformation harm chinese company release consumer share software code business software developer computer code source build distribute product technology source cornerstone development computer software internet artificial intelligence idea technology advance computer code examine china effort enormous implication technology technology increase productivity worker future innovation power military technology autonomous weapon boom late release online chatbot chatgpt china compete technology american company google china progress kuaishou video generator china june user arrival startup kai lee investor technologist chinese office microsoft chatbot technology leading american technology common benchmark test rate performance chatbots technology chinese tech giant alibaba top leaderboard rate source system commonplace belief china talent technology compete lee belief wrong interview dozen technologist researcher chinese tech company source technology key reason china development source opportunity country easy remains forefront official white house trade embargo chinese company powerful version computer chip essential artificial intelligence lawmaker bill white house control export software limit progress source technology rise system top american company technology eclipse power video generator chinese company yiran chen professor electrical computer engineering duke university north carolina inventing bypass china tech industry source technology grow constraint regulator progress american source project lawmaker china gain edge source technology developer system chinese technology source foundation development ment delangue ceo company house source project leadership collaboration company researcher system enormous resource talent data power benefit investment chinese government money project resource center chinese tech company major constraint development system compliance strict censorship regime generative technology video generator follow rule prompt mention china president jinping controversial topic country real estate crisis error message image prompt national people congress video seat respond question step company harmful fake sensitive content technology tech giant willingness contribute country technological advancement power profit tech industry goal sufficiency concern china country struggle amass chip powerful technology chinese company powerful technology system york time company,"[(7, 0.9973701)]",7
726730,Main,24,08/09/2024,Will AI kill meaningless jobs?,"The real question, however, is would  it be so bad.","WHEN Brad Wang started his first job in the tech industry, right after college, he marvelled at the way Silicon Valley had turned the drudgery of the workplace into a sumptuousness of game rooms, nap pods and leafy hiking trails. This is what it must have felt like to be a guest showing up for a party at Jay Gatsby’s house, Wang thought.
 But under the glitz was a kind of hollowness. He hopped from one software engineering role to another, toiling on some projects that he felt were meaningless. At Google, he worked for 15 months on an initiative that higher-ups decided to keep pursuing even though they knew it would never launch. He then spent more than a year at Facebook on a product whose primary customer at one point described it to the engineers as unhelpful.
 Over time, the pointlessness of his work began to incense Wang: “It’s like baking a pie that’s going right into the trash can.”
 The corporate office and its paperwork have a way of turning even ostensibly good jobs – the kind that provide decent salaries and benefits and take place behind ergonomic keyboards in climate-controlled comfort – into soul-sucking drudgery.
 In 2013, the now-deceased radical anthropologist David Graeber gave the world a distinct way to think about this problem in an essay called On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs. This anti-capitalist polemic by the man who had helped coin Occupy Wall Street’s iconic “99%” slogan went viral, seemingly speaking to a widely felt 21st century frustration. Graeber developed it into a book that delved deeper on the subject.
 He suggested that economist John Maynard Keynes’ dream of a 15-hour workweek had never come to pass because humans have invented millions of jobs so useless that even the people doing them can’t justify their existence. A quarter of the workforce in rich countries sees their jobs as potentially pointless, according to a study by Dutch economists Robert Dur and Max van Lent. If workers find the labour dispiriting, and the work adds nothing to society, what’s the argument for keeping these jobs?
 The stakes of that question have heightened as artificial intelligence hurtles forward, bringing with it the spectre of job displacement. A recent estimate by Goldman Sachs found that generative AI could eventually automate activities that amount to the equivalent of some 300 million full-time jobs globally – many of these in office roles like administrators and middle managers.
 When imagining a future where technology replaces human effort, we tend to think in two extremes: as a productivity boon for businesses and a disaster for the humans who will become obsolete.
 There is a possibility that lies somewhere between these scenarios, however, in which AI kills off some jobs that workers themselves deem meaningless, and even find psychologically degrading. If it did, would these workers be better off?
 Flunkies, Goons  and Box Tickers 
 The way researchers talk about AI can sometimes sound like a human resources manager evaluating the bushy-tailed summer intern: shows tremendous promise! It is evident that AI can do quite a lot – mimicking Shakespeare, debugging code; sending emails, reading emails – though it’s not at all clear how far it will go, or what consequences that will bring.
 Robots are adept at pattern recognition, which means they excel at applying the same solution to a problem over and over: churning out copy, reviewing legal documents, translating between languages. When humans do something ad nauseam, their eyes might glaze over, they slip up; chatbots don’t experience ennui.
 These tasks tend to overlap with some of those discussed in Graeber’s book. He identified categories of useless work including “flunkies,” who are paid to make rich and important people look more rich and important; “goons,” who are hired into positions that exist only because competitor companies created similar roles; and “box tickers,” which are, admittedly, subjective. Some economists, trying to make the designation more useful, have sharpened it: jobs that workers themselves find useless, and which produce work that could evaporate tomorrow with no real effect on the world.
 An obvious candidate for “flunky” automation is the executive assistant. IBM already allows users to build their own AI assistants. On Gmail, writers no longer have to compose their own responses, because auto reply generates choices like “yes, that works for me.” AI is even promising to take over personal logistics: AI startup Duckbill uses a combination of AI and human assistants to knock out rote to-do-list items entirely, from returning purchases to buying a child’s birthday present – chores that might have once been shunted to front-desk girls in the “Mad Men” era.Telemarketing, another area that AI is overtaking, qualifies as a “goon” job in Graeber’s assessment, because workers often sell products that they know customers don’t really want or need. Chatbots are good at this because they don’t care whether the task is fulfilling, or if customers are surly. Call centres like AT&T’s are already using AI to script calls with customer service representatives, which has made some of those representatives feel as if they are training their own replacements.
 Software engineering jobs can veer into “box ticking” territory. That was what Wang felt when he wrote lines of code that didn’t go live. As far as he could tell, the only function this work served was to help his bosses get promoted. He is keenly aware that much of this work could be automated.
 But whether or not these jobs provide a sense of existential purpose, they do provide reliable salaries. Many of the meaningless jobs that AI could overtake have traditionally opened up these white-collar fields to people who need opportunities and training, serving as accelerants for class mobility: paralegals, secretaries, assistants. Economists worry that when those jobs disappear, the ones that replace them will bring lower pay, fewer opportunities to ascend professionally and – even less meaning.
 “Even if we take Graeber’s view of those jobs, we should be concerned about eliminating them,” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is the hollowing out of the middle class.”
 It’s nearly impossible to imagine what the labour market will look like as AI improves and transforms our workplaces and our economy. But many workers booted from their meaningless jobs by AI could find new roles, ones that emerge through the process of automation. 
 It’s an old story: Technology has offset job losses with job creation throughout history. Horse drawn carriages were replaced by cars, which created jobs not just on auto assembly lines but also in car sales and gas stations. Personal computing eliminated some 3.5 million jobs, and then created an enormous industry and spurred many others, none of which could have been fathomed a century ago, making clear just why Keynes’ prediction in 1930 of 15-hour workweeks seems so far out of reach.
 Ultimately, while technology will transform work, it can’t displace people’s complicated feelings toward it.
 Wang says he certainly believes that will hold true in Silicon Valley. He predicts that automating pointless work will mean engineers get even more creative about seeking out their promotions. “These jobs exist on selling a vision,” he said. “I fear this is one problem you can’t automate.” — ©2024 The New York Times Company",brad wang job tech industry college silicon valley drudgery workplace sumptuousness game nap pod trail guest party jay gatsby house glitz hollowness software engineering role project google month initiative launch facebook product primary customer engineer unhelpful time pointlessness incense wang pie trash corporate office paperwork job decent salary benefit ergonomic keyboard climate comfort soul drudgery radical anthropologist david graeber distinct essay phenomenon bullshit job capitalist polemic wall street iconic slogan viral century frustration graeber book subject economist john maynard keynes hour workweek pas human million job useless people existence quarter workforce rich country job pointless study dutch economist dur max lent worker society argument job stake question artificial intelligence hurtles spectre job displacement estimate goldman generative automate activity equivalent time job office role administrator manager future technology replaces human effort productivity boon business disaster human obsolete possibility scenario kill job worker worker flunky goon ticker researcher sound human resource manager bushy summer intern tremendous promise evident lot shakespeare code email email consequence robot pattern recognition excel solution copy legal document language human nauseam eye slip chatbots ennui task overlap graeber book category useless flunky rich people rich goon position competitor company role box ticker subjective economist designation job worker useless evaporate tomorrow real obvious candidate flunky automation executive assistant ibm user assistant writer response auto generates choice personal logistics startup duckbill combination human assistant rote list item purchase child birthday chore front desk girl era telemarketing qualifies job graeber assessment worker product customer chatbots task fulfilling customer centre script customer service representative representative replacement software engineering job box territory wang line code function boss aware job sense existential purpose reliable salary job white collar field people opportunity accelerants class mobility paralegal assistant economist job lower pay fewer opportunity meaning graeber view job simon johnson economist institute technology middle class impossible imagine labour market transforms workplace economy worker meaningless job role process automation story technology job loss job creation history horse drawn carriage car job auto line car sale gas station personal computing job enormous industry fathomed century keynes hour workweek technology transform displace people feeling wang true silicon valley predicts pointless engineer promotion job vision fear automate york time company,"[(2, 0.99707246)]",2

 Ant Group said its Zhixiaobao app can help users “order meals, hail taxis, book tickets, and discover local dining and entertainment options” as well as access services in the digital payment app Alipay.
 Unveiled in Shanghai on Thursday, comes as tech giants such as Google, Meta and Microsoft ramp up investment in the AI market, with many firms touting tighter integration of chatbots.
 “Alipay is committed to harnessing AI’s potential to improve the user experience, ensuring that AI assistants like Zhixiaobao become valuable tools in everyday life for all,” Ant Group president Cyril Han said in a news release.

726352,Main,29,07/09/2024,"US, Britain, EU set  to sign  first global  treaty on AI",,"BENGALURU: The first legally binding international AI treaty has been opened for signing and adoption by the countries that negotiated it, which includes European Union members, the United States and Britain, the Council of Europe human rights organisation said.
 The AI Convention, which has been in the works for years and was adopted in May after discussions between 57 countries, addresses the risks AI may pose, while promoting responsible innovation.
 “This Convention is a major step to ensuring that these new technologies can be harnessed without eroding our oldest values, like human rights and the rule of law,” Britain’s justice minister, Shabana Mahmood, said in a statement.
 The AI Convention mainly focuses on the protection of human rights of people affected by AI systems and is separate from the EU AI Act, which entered into force last month.
 The EU’s AI Act entails comprehensive regulations on the development, deployment, and use of AI systems within the EU internal market.
 The Council of Europe, founded in 1949, is an international organisation distinct from the EU with a mandate to safeguard human rights; 46 countries are members, including all the 27 EU member states.
 An ad hoc committee in 2019 started examining the feasibility of an AI framework convention and a Committee on Artificial Intelligence was formed in 2022 which drafted and negotiated the text.
 The countries who become  signatories can choose to adopt  or maintain legislative, administrative or other measures to give effect to the provisions.
 Francesca Fanucci, a legal expert at the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law Stichting who contributed to the treaty’s drafting process alongside other civil society groups, said in an interview that the agreement had been “watered down” into a broad set of principles.
 “The formulation of principles and obligations in this convention is so overbroad and fraught with caveats.
 “It raises serious questions about their legal certainty and effective enforceability,” Fanucci said.
 The legal expert also highlighted exemptions on AI systems used for national security purposes, and limited scrutiny of private companies versus the public sector, as flaws. 
 “This double standard is disappointing,” she added.

726466,Lifestyle,2,07/09/2024,"A visit to Norway, guided by AI",,"THE assignment was clear: Test how well artificial intelligence could plan a trip to Norway, a place I’d never been. So I did none of my usual obsessive online research and instead asked three AI planners to create a four-day itinerary. 
 None of them, alas, mentioned the saunas or the salmon.
 Two assistants were, however, eager to learn more about me  in order to tailor their initially generic recommendations, which they had spewed out within  seconds. 
 Vacay, a personalised travel planning tool, presented me with a list of questions, while Mindtrip, a new AI travel assistant, invited me to take a quiz. (ChatGPT, the third assistant, asked nothing.)
 Vacay’s and Mindtrip’s questions were similar: Are you travelling solo? What’s your budget? Do you prefer hotels or Airbnbs? Would you rather explore the great outdoors or pursue a cultural experience?
 Eventually, my chat sessions yielded what seemed like well-rounded itineraries, starting with one day in Oslo and moving on to the fjord region. Eventually, I locked down a trip that would combine the assistants’ information and go beyond a predictable list of sites.
 This time around, my virtual planners were far more sophisticated than the simple ChatGPT interface I used last year on a trip to Milan in Italy. Though it offered more detailed suggestions for Norway, I ended up ditching ChatGPT in the travel-planning stage after it repeatedly crashed.
 Vacay’s premium service, which starts at US$9.99 (RM43.60) per month, included in-depth suggestions and booking links, while Mindtrip, which is currently free, provided photos, Google reviews and maps. During the trip itself, each delivered instantaneous information by text and always asked if more specific details were needed. 
 Sadly, only ChatGPT offered a phone app, whose information I found to be outdated (the premium version is more current).
 I’m not alone when it comes to turning to AI for help: Around 70% of Americans are either using or planning to use AI for travel planning, according to a recent survey conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of the personal finance app Moneylion, while 71% said using AI would most likely be easier than planning trips on one’s own.
 I decided to find out for myself in Norway.
 A whirlwind day in Oslo 
 After I landed at Oslo Airport, all three assistants directed me  to the Flytoget Airport Express Train, which got me to the city in 20 minutes. I was delighted to find my hotel adjacent to the  central railway station.
 Choosing accommodations had not been easy. I was looking for a mid-range boutique hotel, and the AI assistants generated many options with little overlap. 
 I went with Hotel Amerikalinjen, Vacay’s recommendation, which it described as “a vibrant and unique boutique hotel in the heart of Oslo”. Its location was the main draw, but overall the hotel exceeded my expectations, blending comfort and style with the 20th-century charm of its building, which once housed the headquarters of the Norwegian America Line shipping company.
 For the one-day Oslo itinerary, the assistants were in agreement, packing in the city’s top sights, including the Vigeland Sculpture Park, the Royal Palace, the Nobel Peace Centre, Akershus Fortress and the Munch Museum. 
 I shared my location and asked each assistant to restructure the itineraries to start from my hotel. But when I gave in to my own research instincts and pulled up Google Maps, I saw that the order they suggested didn’t make sense, so I plotted my own path.
 By the time I got to Frogner Park at midday, I had already covered half of the sights, and after walking past more than 200 sculptures by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, I was happy to sit down and admire his granite monolith of entwined humans.
 For lunch, the assistants recommended high-end restaurants in the bustling waterfront neighbourhood of Aker Brygge. But I wanted a quick bite in a more relaxed atmosphere, so I ditched AI and walked to the end of the promenade, where I stumbled upon The Salmon, a cosy establishment where I started with salmon sashimi that melted in my mouth and finished with a perfectly grilled fillet. 
 How had my assistants not mentioned this place?
 Next on my list was the Nobel Peace Centre, the Opera House and the Munch Museum. The assistants had not recommended pre-booking tickets, but fortunately, I had done so, learning, in the process, that the Peace Centre was closed, a crucial bit of information that AI did not relay.
 It was chilly for mid-June,  and as I walked along the harbour promenade toward the Munch Museum, I spotted small floating saunas, which my assistants had not included. I went back to the ChatGPT phone app for recommendations. 
 Even though I was eager to try a floating sauna, where people warmed themselves and then plunged straight into the frigid waters of the Oslofjord, I took ChatGPT’s suggestion and booked the Salt sauna, which is where I headed after spending a few hours at the Munch Museum, with its extensive works by the Norwegian artist and its sweeping views of Oslo’s harbour.
 At the Salt cultural complex, a large pyramidal structure on the water, I was relieved that swimsuits were a requirement. In Scandinavia, saunas are usually taken naked, and earlier, I had asked ChatGPT for the etiquette at Salt, but it failed to give me a definitive answer. After sweating it out with around 30 strangers in Salt’s main sauna, I dipped into a cold-water barrel tub and then tried the smaller sauna options, which were hotter and quieter. It was the perfect ending to a long day.
 Waterfalls, valleys,  raging waters 
 Each of my assistants had different ideas on how to reach the fjord region. ChatGPT suggested taking a seven-hour train ride and then immediately embarking on a two-hour fjord cruise, which sounded exhausting. 
 Mindtrip suggested taking a short flight to Bergen, known as the “gateway to the fjords”, and setting out on a cruise the next day, which was perhaps more efficient, but would also mean missing one of the most scenic train rides in the world. 
 Vacay also recommended a train ride.
 After conversing with the assistants, I decided on a shorter train journey (six hours) that would deliver me to Naeroy-fjord, a Unesco World Heritage Site with lush valleys and thundering waterfalls. But to figure out the logistics for transport and accommodation, I needed live train timetables, which I found on my own, and information on hotel availability that none of the assistants had.
 At this point, I was desperate for human guidance to navigate the region’s expensive and limited accommodations. This is where the pictures and reviews on Mindtrip were useful, helping me to understand that I would be paying premium prices for the spectacular setting of a mediocre hotel.
 The train ride from Oslo to Myrdal was breathtaking: rolling hills, mountain villages, fjords, waterfalls. But nothing prepared me for the majestic one-hour Flam railway ride that followed. Vacay had described it as an “engineering marvel” with a breathtakingly steep descent as it passes picturesque villages, dramatic mountains, raging rivers and pounding waterfalls, complete with a dance performance featuring a mythological spirit known as a huldra.
 The next morning I boarded a Naeroyfjord cruise, recommended by Vacay, on an electric, 400-person vessel. I was surprised by the serenity of the fjord. Later I learned from a tour guide that I had been lucky to visit when there were no large cruise ships. 
 It was hard to imagine an ocean liner manoeuvring through the narrow, windy fjord, but when I asked ChatGPT, it told me 150 to 220 cruise ships squeezed through the fjord each year, a detail that I felt the travel assistants should warn travellers about.
 The cruise ended in the village of Gudvangen, where rain made me cancel a hike to a waterfall and instead try my hand at axe-throwing in the Viking Village Njardarheimr. The assistants had told me that there were buses that left town every four hours, a time frame that had worked with my original hiking plan, but now I was stuck. 
 Thankfully, I took note of the AI disclaimers to check all information and found an alternative shuttle bus.
 On my way to Bergen, I decided to stop in the town of Voss, famous for extreme sports like skydiving and spectacular nature. All the AI-suggested hotels were booked, but a Google search led me to the lakeside Elva hotel, which had delicious farm-to-table food. I suspect it didn’t make the AI shortlist because it was new.
 I ended my trip in Bergen, which, despite being Norway’s second-largest city, maintains a small-town charm with its colourful wooden houses and cobblestone streets. With only half a day to explore, I followed Mindtrip’s short itinerary, starting with a hearty lunch of fish and chips at the bustling waterfront fish market and ending with a funicular ride up Mount Floyen for panoramic views of the city and fjords. 
 The AI dinner suggestion at the Colonialen was perfect: cosy vibe, live jazz and locally sourced dishes.
 The bottom line 
 None of the AI programmes were perfect, but they did complement one another, allowing me to streamline my travel decisions.
 Overall, Mindtrip – with its polished, dynamic interface that allowed me to cross-check details with maps, links and reviews – was my favourite. While it gave some good recommendations, Mindtrip needed more prompting than Vacay, which offered a wider variety of suggestions in more detail. 
 Unfortunately, Vacay doesn’t save chat history, which I discovered halfway into my planning after closing the website’s tab on my browser.
 The biggest drawback was the absence of phone apps for Mindtrip and Vacay, which led me to rely on ChatGPT’s basic AI assistant when I needed on-the-spot guidance. Mindtrip, I’ve since learned, is planning to debut an app this month. 
 Still, there were times when I desperately craved the human touch. Before setting out on a trip, I always contact friends and colleagues for recommendations. This time, as part of the AI experiment, I refrained from reaching out to a Norwegian friend until after my trip, only to find out that we had both been in Oslo at the same time.

 To achieve the goal of having the digital economy contribute 30% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030 – up from 12% in 2023 – Vietnam must attract significant investment and drive AI innovation.
 Google’s research highlighted that AI will play a crucial role in Vietnam’s digital economy, potentially generating an annual economic impact of 1.73 quadrillion dong or about US$69.5bil by 2030. 
 The study, covering 43 sectors, found that more than half could achieve breakthroughs through AI.
 AI is expected to bolster Vietnam’s manufacturing competitiveness, advance the electric vehicle (EV) industry, and help meet green-energy goals. It will also enhance agricultural efficiency, address climate challenges, and support economic growth.
 Moreover, AI is vital for Vietnam’s ambition to become a high-income developed country by 2045, driving productivity, attracting investment, creating high-tech jobs, and supporting micro, small, and medium enterprises, according to the report.
 Despite the critical role of productivity growth in economic development, Vietnam has missed its labour productivity targets for three consecutive years, with the 2024 goal set lower than in 2023.
 The Vietnam’s Future Digital Economy towards 2030 and 2045 report estimates that the digital economy could contribute 7% to 16.5% annually to productivity growth from 2020 to 2030. 
 Although the impact is initially modest, AI could significantly boost productivity, potentially doubling GDP contributions compared to new business models, according to McKinsey.
 “This isn’t merely about typical development; it’s about breakthrough growth. Advancing AI applications will also catalyse the growth of tech startups in Vietnam,” said Do Tien Thinh, deputy director of the National Innovation Centre (NIC).
 Vietnam is already harnessing AI to enhance its competitiveness as a manufacturing hub, particularly in high-tech industries like electronics and telecommunications. 
 Leading Vietnamese enterprises such as Viettel, FPT, VinAI, CMC, and VNPT are at the forefront of AI innovation, demonstrating the technology’s potential to benefit a wide range of businesses.
 Investment in AI is also rising, with over US$4.6bil invested in Vietnamese startups from 2014 to 2023, according to the 2024 Vietnam Technology and Innovation Investment report by NIC and Do Ventures. 
 This reflects Vietnam’s burgeoning status as a centre for technological innovation.
 Oxford Insights, in its early 2024 report, ranked Vietnam 59th out of 193 countries and territories for government AI readiness, and fifth in the Asean region. The report highlighted Vietnam’s vibrant economy, youthful and tech-savvy population, burgeoning tech sector, and influx of international investment as fertile grounds for AI innovation.
 Research by Thundermark Capital also listed Vietnam and Singapore as the two South-East Asian representatives in the global Top 30 for AI research.
 Vietnam’s position in AI development is supported by several key advantages.
 The country’s burgeoning digital economy, aimed at contributing 20% of GDP by 2025 and 30% by 2030, provides a strong foundation for AI integration.
 The rapid growth of Vietnam’s Internet economy, already among the fastest-growing in the world, further strengthens its position.
 Vietnam’s young, tech-savvy population is also a significant asset. 
 The country has a large pool of engineers and IT professionals, many well-versed in AI technologies. This, combined with a strong emphasis on STEM education, ensures a steady pipeline of talent to drive AI innovation.
 Many major international companies see Vietnam as a promising research and development hub. 
 Recent visits and large-scale conferences featuring foreign tech leaders like Nvidia chairman Jensen Huang and Google AI lead Jeff Dean underscore Vietnam’s potential in the field. — Viet Nam News/ANN",hanoi dynamic landscape south east asia vietnam technological revolution leverage power artificial intelligence redefine economy foster innovation boost productivity enhance global competitiveness july report opportunity agenda google critical role digitalisation vietnam economy competitive regional global scale report generate bil economic benefit east asian economy vietnam achieve goal digital economy contribute gross domestic product gdp vietnam attract investment drive innovation google play crucial role vietnam digital economy annual economic impact quadrillion bil study sector breakthrough bolster vietnam competitiveness advance electric vehicle industry meet green energy goal agricultural efficiency address climate economic growth vital vietnam ambition income country productivity investment tech job micro medium critical role productivity growth economic development vietnam labour productivity target consecutive goal lower vietnam future digital economy report digital economy productivity growth impact modest boost productivity gdp contribution business model typical development growth application growth tech startup tien thinh deputy director national innovation centre nic vietnam enhance competitiveness hub tech industry telecommunication vietnamese enterprise fpt vinai cmc vnpt forefront innovation technology potential benefit wide range business investment bil vietnamese startup technology innovation investment report nic venture vietnam status centre technological innovation oxford insight report vietnam country territory government readiness asean region report vietnam vibrant economy youthful tech savvy population tech sector international investment fertile innovation thundermark capital vietnam south east asian representative global top vietnam position development key advantage country digital economy gdp strong foundation integration rapid growth vietnam internet economy fastest strengthens position tech savvy population asset country pool engineer professional technology strong emphasis stem education steady pipeline talent drive innovation major international company development hub visit scale conference foreign tech leader chairman jensen huang google lead jeff dean vietnam potential field viet nam news ann,"[(7, 0.82967615), (13, 0.16702746)]",7
724734,Lifestyle,6,02/09/2024,AI’s translation troubles,"When AI fails the  language test, who  is left out of the conversation?","STANFORD researchers gave a popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot a language test.
 They asked the bot in Vietnamese to write a traditional poem in the form known as “song that luc bat” that follows a pattern of lines made up of seven, seven, six, then eight words. When the bot spit out an answer, it wrote a poem but didn’t follow the format.
 The team tried a different prompt, asking what the proper Vietnamese word was for a mother’s younger brother, and it responded with the words for a father’s younger and older siblings.
 These flaws are not unique to Claude 3.5, the chatbot by the AI company Anthropic that the researchers queried, but they illustrate some of the ways in which AI can get language outside of standard American English wrong.
 While the use of AI has exploded in the West, much of the rest of the world has been left out of the conversation since most of the technology is trained in English. AI experts worry that the language gap could exacerbate technological inequities and that it could leave many regions and cultures behind.
 A delay of access to good technology of even a few years “can potentially lead to a few decades of economic delay”, said Sang Truong, a doctoral candidate at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University, on the team that built and tested a Vietnamese language model against others.
 The tests his team ran found that AI tools across the board could get facts and diction wrong when working with Vietnamese, likely because it is a “low-resource” language by industry standards, which means that there aren’t sufficient data sets and content available online for the AI model to learn from.
 Low-resource languages are spoken by tens and sometimes hundreds of millions of people around the world, but they yield less digital data because AI tech development and online engagement are centred in the United States and China. Other low-resource languages include Hindi, Bengali and Swahili, as well as lesser-known dialects spoken by smaller populations around the world.
 An analysis of top websites by W3Techs, a tech survey company, found that English makes up more than 60% of the Internet’s language data. 
 While English is widely spoken globally, native English speakers make up about 5% of the population, according to Ethnologue, a research organisation that collects language data. Mandarin and Spanish are other examples of languages with a significant online presence and reliable digital data sets.
 Academic institutions, grassroots organisations and volunteer efforts are playing catch-up to build resources for speakers of languages who aren’t as well represented in the digital landscape.
 Lelapa AI, based in Johannesburg, is one such company leading efforts on the African continent. The South African-based startup is developing multilingual AI products for people and businesses in Africa.
 “I think it’s such a dangerous concept that people need to assimilate to a different culture and have to take on different cultures in order to have access to progress,” said Pelonomi Moiloa, CEO and co-founder of Lelapa AI.
 The company is less focused on scale than on community-specific solutions, she said. It is crafting its products to be more resource- efficient, cost-effective and to be used primarily for speech-to-speech communication in the local languages, which make the technology more accessible to African people.
 “Large companies like Google, Apple, OpenAI, for example, have not necessarily trained their models for tools that serve these markets,” Chinasa T. Okolo, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, said about communities with low-resource languages. “They don’t provide enough market value for them to do so.”
 A communications officer for OpenAI said the company releases AI systems steadily to more groups of people and that its latest model supports more than 50 languages. 
 Google pointed to its projects focussing on AI development for under-represented languages, including a “1,000 languages” initiative, announced in 2022, to build language models for the 1,000 most-spoken languages in the world. Apple said it, too, has developed products to support a range of languages.
 The consequences of the language gap in AI tools can be numerous. The technology has the potential to increase productivity and change workplaces, but without reliable data in local languages, some regions of the world could miss out on the economic benefits, according to AI experts. The exclusion of low-resource languages could also lead to cultural bias in AI products.
 AI’s lack of knowledge in low-resource languages has the potential to raise security concerns as well. Sara Hooker, the head of Cohere for AI, the non-profit research arm of the startup Cohere, said some users could bypass the safety measures of AI products by asking questions in other languages.
 “You can easily, for example, still get very dangerous instructions about how to build a bomb just by switching to a different language,” Hooker said.
 While the issue is obvious to many in the industry, the solutions are complicated. Large-language models (LLMs), which are used to communicate in human language, require large banks of high-quality data, often collected from the Internet and not easily accessible for low-resource languages. Truong equated building an LLM to teaching a newborn: There may be 20,000 books with lessons in English, but there are just five in Vietnamese.
 The disparity is so large in some regions that governments have stepped in to back efforts to build their own language models. The Nigerian government promised to back the tech startup Awarri in building a model for local languages. Both Iceland’s government and the Welsh government work with OpenAI to improve ChatGPT’s understanding of the native languages there.
 “The language gap is really important in terms of access, but it is also just really important to help reenergise people’s sense of pride in who they are, where they come from,” Moiloa of Lelapa AI said. – The New York Times",stanford researcher popular artificial intelligence chatbot language test bot vietnamese write traditional poem form song luc bat pattern line spit answer follow format team prompt vietnamese word mother brother father sibling unique claude chatbot company anthropic researcher illustrate language standard american english wrong west rest conversation technology english expert language gap technological inequity region culture access technology lead decade economic delay sang truong doctoral candidate stanford artificial intelligence laboratory stanford university team vietnamese language model test tool board diction vietnamese low resource language industry standard sufficient data set content online model learn low resource language ten hundred million people digital data tech development online engagement united china low resource language bengali swahili lesser spoken population analysis top website tech survey company english internet language data native english speaker ethnologue organisation collect language data spanish example online presence reliable digital data set academic institution organisation effort build resource speaker language digital landscape lelapa johannesburg company effort african continent south african startup multilingual product people business dangerous concept people culture culture access progress pelonomi moiloa ceo founder lelapa company scale community specific solution product resource efficient cost effective speech speech communication local language technology accessible african people company apple openai model tool market fellow center technology innovation brookings institution community low resource language market communication officer company system people support language project development language language initiative build language model language apple product support range language consequence language gap numerous technology potential increase productivity change workplace reliable data local language region economic benefit expert exclusion low resource language cultural bias product lack knowledge low resource potential raise security concern sara hooker head cohere profit arm startup cohere user safety measure product question language dangerous instruction bomb language hooker issue obvious industry solution language model communicate human language require bank quality data internet accessible low resource language building llm newborn book lesson vietnamese disparity region government effort build language model nigerian government tech startup awarri model local language government welsh government chatgpt native language language gap term access reenergise people moiloa lelapa york time,"[(14, 0.99705464)]",14
723660,Main,23,30/08/2024,UK launches AI project to help teachers with school,,"London: The UK government announced a “first-of-its kind” £4mil (RM23mil) project to bolster artificial intelligence tools to help teachers plan lessons and mark homework.
 As part of project, government documents like curriculum guidance, lesson plans, and student assessments will be provided to AI companies to train their tech to “generate accurate, high-quality content, like tailored, creative lesson plans and workbooks”.
 The generative AI tools will help teachers mark work and create teaching material, the science and education departments said in a press release.
 “Today’s world-leading an­nouncement marks a huge step forward for AI in the classroom,” said early education minister Stephen Morgan, part of the recently elected Labour government on Wednesday.
 Science Secretary Peter Kyle said the project aims to “ease admin burdens” and will “transform how we see and use public sector data”.
 The project claims to have a “first-of-its kind approach to processing government data for AI”.
 A government-commissioned research paper on public attitudes to AI in education published on Wednesday found that while those surveyed agreed AI could help teachers, there were concerns of over-reliance on the technology.
 Parents and students “were worried about the loss of key social and technical skills and reduced human contact-time leading to unintended adverse outcomes”, according to the research.

723022,Main,17,29/08/2024,Ensuring that AI serves humanity,,"IN the grand theatre of human progress, we stand on the precipice of a new act where the protagonists are not flesh and blood but silicon and code. 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI), once the stuff of science fiction, has stepped into the spotlight, promising to revolutionise every corner of our existence. Yet, as we marvel at the brilliance of these artificial minds, we must ask ourselves: Are we dancing with the future, or are we being led astray by a digital pied piper?
 AI is a double-edged sword, its sharpness promising to both heal and harm. Like a painter with infinite brushes, it has the power to create masterpieces of efficiency, precision, and innovation. 
 In medicine, AI holds the potential to diagnose diseases with an accuracy that rivals the best of human doctors. In agriculture, it can predict and manage crop yields with unparalleled foresight. 
 In every sector, AI promises to be the lighthouse guiding us through the fog of complexity.
 But even as we celebrate these advances, we must not lose sight of the shadows that AI casts. The very intelligence we admire is also the harbinger of a profound disruption – one that threatens to unravel the delicate fabric of our society. 
 Jobs once considered safe and secure are being swallowed by the insatiable maw of automation. The artisan, craftsman, and skilled worker – figures who have shaped civilisations – now find themselves at risk of obsolescence, replaced by machines that do not tire, err, or need a paycheck. 
 More insidious still is the potential for AI to amplify the biases and prejudices that have long plagued humanity. These artificial minds, despite their inhuman brilliance, are not immune to the flaws of their creators. 
 In the hands of the reckless, AI can become a weapon, perpetuating inequalities and injustices with a speed and scale unimaginable in the analogue world. 
 The biases coded into algorithms, whether by design or oversight, can lead to decisions that are as unjust as they are invisible, hidden behind a veneer of mathematical objectivity.
 In our pursuit of artificial intelligence, we may be at risk of losing something deeply human. The poet in us might falter as we come to rely more on the cold logic of machines and less on the warmth of human intuition. The philosopher in us might wither as we outsource our moral dilemmas to systems that calculate without conscience. 
 The very essence of what it means to be human – empathy, creativity, and ethical reasoning – may be eroded as we increasingly defer to our digital counterparts.
 But there is hope. The story of AI is not yet written, and the pen remains in our hands. We must approach this new era with both optimism and caution, balancing our excitement with a deep sense of responsibility. 
 The key lies in ensuring that AI serves humanity, not the other way around. We must demand transparency, fairness, and accountability from those who design and deploy these systems. We must champion the values that make us human – compassion, justice, and respect for the dignity of all people – as we navigate this uncharted territory.
 In the end, the irony of intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is that it is both a gift and a burden. Like fire, it can warm our homes or burn them to the ground. The challenge before us is to harness this new flame to ensure that it illuminates rather than incinerates.

722334,StarBiz,12,27/08/2024,Vietnam’s manufacturing growth hinges on AI to spur GDP,,"HANOI: While digital transformation is a priority for manufacturers, around 30% to 40% of global and Asia-Pacific (Apac) respondents recognise achieving it is fraught with obstacles.
 Those barriers include the cost and availability of labour, scaling technology solutions and the convergence of information technology and operational technology.
 The information was released at the findings of 2024 Manufacturing Vision Study from Zebra Technologies Corp, a leading digital solution provider enabling businesses to intelligently connect data, assets and people.
 The study showed that globally, 61% of manufacturers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to drive growth by 2029, up from 41% in 2024.
 In Apac, 68% of manufacturers expect AI to drive growth by 2029, increasing from 46% in 2024. 
 This surge in AI adoption, combined with 92% global and 87% of Apac survey respondents prioritising digital transformation, underscores manufacturers’ intent to improve data management and leverage new technologies that enhance visibility and quality throughout the manufacturing process. 
 In Vietnam, the government has consistently set ambitious targets for the manufacturing sector, with it expected to contribute 30% to the overall gross domestic product (GDP).
 The sector’s contribution to GDP is expected to grow by more than 8.5% per annum, while labour productivity is forecast to grow 7.5% per annum. 
 To achieve these goals, Vietnamese businesses must embrace the need for reskilling and retraining their workforce to stay competitive. Adopting AI and other advanced technologies is crucial for enhancing productivity, improving quality and streamlining operations.

 The Sustainable Brands Kuala Lumpur (SBKL) 2024 conference held at the Sime Darby Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur, featured over 25  speakers.
 They included industry leaders, innovators and sustainability advocates who shared insights and best practices on utilising technology and AI to drive change.
 Recent extreme climate conditions, overpopulation, social inequity and unchecked development heightened the urgency of leveraging technology and AI to accelerate the necessary transitions for brands and companies.
 Also at the event was former Cabinet minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who spoke about empowering youths to shape a sustainable future, in his new role as a radio presenter and podcaster.
 Other keynote presentations and panel discussions delved into a broad range of topics, including technology from a living systems perspective, smart energy systems and sustainable supply chain management.
 Conference convenor Sharmini Nagulan, who is Acacia Blue managing director, said the intersection of technology and sustainability was no longer a theoretical discussion but a crucial part of reality.
 “As we face unprecedented environmental challenges, we can harness the power of AI and technology to create regenerative solutions that benefit both people and the planet,” she said.
 Another highlight of the event was the opening address of Sustainable Brands Worldwide chief executive officer Mike Dupee.
 “We recognise that addressing systemic challenges requires systemic solutions, and so we remain focused on bringing our global community together to address these challenges in a context that aligns social and environmental benefits with shared economic prosperity,”  he said.
 Invictus Blue Group president Keith Miranda noted that for  sustainability to work, it must  be recognised as a shared  responsibility among government, businesses and the public.
 He added that people no longer view sustainability as a ‘nice to have’, but rather as a necessity in life.
 “The challenge is to encourage an orderly and responsible transition that leaves no one behind.
 “Invictus Blue, as a 30-year homegrown integrated communications agency, is committed to supporting brands and businesses on this journey to make the planet a better place,” said Miranda.
 Attendees engaged in dynamic discussions, networked with like-minded professionals and participated in workshops designed to foster collaboration and innovation.

721902,Lifestyle,6,26/08/2024,The AI fear factor,"‘Why do I need AI in my coffee maker?’ AI-labelled products can scare away customers, a study finds.","DESPITE almost a quarter of US adults using ChatGPT and thousands of companies integrating artificial intelligence into their operations, many consumers haven’t ditched the fear of a Terminator-style AI takeover. That could be bad news for brands trying to convince customers to buy their AI-stamped products.
 A study published in the Journal Of Hospitality Market And Management in June found consumers were less interested in purchasing an item if it was labelled with the term “AI”. 
 Across a series of studies, participants were asked about their intention to buy a product – from televisions to vacuums to consumer and health services – labelled with one of two descriptors, “AI-powered” or “high tech”.
 Among about 200 participants across age and gender demographics, the impact of AI labels on a consumer’s willingness to buy a product was unanimous, according to Dogan Gursoy, a hospitality management professor at Washington State University’s Carson College of Business and one of the study’s authors.
 “In every single case,” Gursoy said, “whenever we mentioned ‘AI’ versus ‘high tech’, consumers’ purchase intention went down.”
 Indeed, shoppers are largely threatened by AI, with only 30% of respondents saying they trust generative AI, according to a Cognizant survey of 1,000 US consumers. 
 Almost three-fourths of respondents believed genAI would increase corporate profits, and 28% believed genAI would benefit consumers the least compared to corporations, small businesses, employees, and the government.
 Brands have largely overestimated consumer trust in AI, Gursoy said, and he has the research to support his claim. When consumers had lower emotional trust, a critical factor in determining if a shopper will buy a product, they also had low purchase intentions for products labelled “AI-powered”. Purchase intentions and emotional trust were lower for items participants considered higher risk, such as cars.
 Identity threats and  existential fears
 For many consumers, the anxiety around AI stems from an identity threat the technology poses, Gursoy said. The fear of AI taking over humanity – exemplified in Gen Z’s fear of losing their jobs to the technology – is still salient.
 “It threatens my identity, threatens the human identity,” Gursoy said. “Nothing’s supposed to be more intelligent than us.”
 These fears have been exacerbated by consumer concerns over privacy, with most consumers saying their trust in AI has already been eroded by organisations using the technology, per Cisco’s 2023 Consumer Privacy Survey. 
 Lawmakers are reacting accordingly: The proliferation of deepfake video and audio content caused Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell to sound the alarm over AI, warning companies that use the technology that they must abide by the commonwealth’s consumer-protection and data-privacy laws. Amazon’s use of a palm-scanning payment system at Whole Foods stores sparked concern from cybersecurity experts.
 “Any time you entrust your data with a private corporation, you’re trusting that company to keep that data safe. And most of the time, you probably shouldn’t,” Evan Greer, director of tech regulation advocacy group Fight for the Future, told CNBC.
 Amazon Web Services’ chief information security officer Chris Betz said in a June blog post the company is prioritising security as it continues to invest in genAI.
 No one’s getting it right
 Since there’s already distrust towards AI, brands producing and advertising AI-powered products have an uphill battle ahead. Consumers need to be convinced of AI’s benefits in a particular product, Gursoy said: “Many people question, Why do I need AI in my coffee maker, or why do I need AI in my refrigerator or my vacuum cleaner?”
 The only problem is that no company has been able to successfully tap into this strategy, he argued.
 “Companies are not doing a great job of that kind of messaging,” Gursoy said. “Everyone is keeping the AI development or what’s going on with AI a secret, and that’s understandable. But consumers also need to know that their data is safe.”
 In order for consumers to purchase items espousing the utility of AI, brands need to first assuage anxieties around the technology. That means companies spelling out the benefits of a product thanks to AI and increasing transparency practices around data usage.
 “There are always people who will never want that,” Gursoy said. “But for a large portion of consumers, we need to nudge their mind.” – Fortune.com/The New York Times",quarter adult thousand company artificial intelligence operation consumer fear terminator style takeover bad news brand convince customer product journal hospitality market management june consumer item labelled term series study intention product television consumer health service descriptor tech participant age gender demographic label consumer willingness product unanimous dogan gursoy hospitality management professor washington university carson college business study author single gursoy versus tech consumer intention shopper respondent generative cognizant survey consumer fourth respondent genai increase corporate profit genai benefit consumer corporation business employee government brand consumer trust gursoy support claim consumer lower emotional trust critical factor shopper buy product low purchase intention product purchase intention emotional trust item participant risk car identity existential fear consumer identity threat technology gursoy fear humanity gen fear job technology salient identity human identity gursoy intelligent fear consumer concern privacy consumer organisation technology cisco consumer privacy survey lawmaker proliferation deepfake video audio content massachusetts attorney andrea campbell sound alarm company technology consumer protection data privacy law palm payment system food store concern cybersecurity expert time entrust data private corporation company data safe time evan greer director tech regulation advocacy fight future cnbc amazon web service chief security officer chris betz june blog post company security invest genai distrust brand advertising product uphill battle consumer benefit product gursoy people coffee maker refrigerator vacuum cleaner company tap strategy company job gursoy development secret understandable consumer data safe consumer item utility brand assuage anxiety technology company benefit product transparency practice usage people portion consumer fortune york time,"[(14, 0.99605983)]",14
720962,StarBiz,11,23/08/2024,Snowflake outlook fails to calm investors on AI,,"NEW YORK: Snowflake Inc gave a sales outlook that failed to reassure investors that the company will gain ground in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) software tools. 
 The shares fell in extended trading.
 Product revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflake’s business, will be US$850mil to US$855mil in the period ending in October, the company said Wednesday in a statement. 
 Analysts, on average, predicted US$848mil, although some estimates exceeded US$900mil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also raised its financial-year product sales forecast to US$3.36bil from US$3.3bil.
 Under chief executive officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has launched products focused on generative AI and other new ways to analyse large sets of data. 
 The strategy is fuelled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake offers software that helps customers find, organise and use huge amounts of information from a variety of sources.
 Ramaswamy touted “product delivery, and great traction in the early stages of our new AI products”.
 Still, Snowflake is navigating a challenging environment between a recent chief executive change, security breaches of its customers and some market shift to products outside its traditional wheelhouse, wrote Derrick Wood, an analyst at TD Cowen, ahead of the results.
 In its financial second quarter, total revenue rose 29% to US$868.8mil – coming in under 30% for the first time in Snowflake’s history as a publicly traded company.
 The shares declined about 7% in extended trading after closing at US$135.06 in New York. 
 The stock has dropped 32% this year, as investors have been concerned about Snowflake’s ability to catch up in AI-oriented tools.
 Clients including AT&T Inc, Live Nation Entertainment Inc’s Ticketmaster and LendingTree Inc had their Snowflake accounts breached as part of a hacking campaign beginning in May. 
 Snowflake has said its own systems weren’t infiltrated and has added features for customers to implement better security settings.
 “We obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,” Ramaswamy said of the customer breaches during a conference call after the results were released. “The issue wasn’t on the Snowflake side.”
 Product revenue increased 30% to US$829mil in the quarter, compared with the US$813mil expected by analysts.

 Lingo Telecom, the voice service provider that transmitted the robocalls, agreed on Wed­nesday to the settlement to resolve enforcement action taken by the Federal Communications Commission, which had initially sought a US$2mil (RM8.74mil) fine.
 The case is seen by many as an unsettling early example of how AI might be used to influence groups of voters and democracy as a whole.
 Meanwhile Steve Kramer, a political consultant who orchestrated the calls, still faces a proposed US$6mil (RM26.2mil) FCC fine as well as state criminal charges.
 The phone messages were sent to thousands of New Hampshire voters on Jan 21. 
 They featured a voice similar to Biden’s falsely suggesting that voting in the state’s presidential primary would preclude them from casting ballots in the Nov­ember general election.
 Kramer, who paid a magician and self-described “digital nomad” to create the recording, said earlier this year that he wasn’t trying to influence the outcome of the primary, but he rather wanted to highlight the potential dangers of AI and spur lawmakers into action.If found guilty, Kramer could face a prison sentence of up to seven years on a charge of voter suppression and a sentence of up to one year on a charge of impersonating a candidate. — AP",meredith company deceptive call hampshire voter artificial intelligence mimic presi dent joe biden voice pay mil fine federal regulator telecom voice service provider robocalls nesday settlement enforcement action federal communication commission mil fine unsettling influence voter democracy political consultant call mil mil fcc fine criminal charge phone message thousand voter featured voice biden presidential primary preclude ballot nov ember election kramer magician digital nomad create earlier influence outcome primary potential danger spur lawmaker action guilty kramer prison sentence charge voter suppression sentence charge candidate,"[(12, 0.98771536)]",12
720200,StarBiz,6,21/08/2024,AI-powered system to hunt down financial scammers,,"KUALA LUMPUR: Regulators and financial institutions are taking further steps to address the elevated prevalence of financial scams.
 Bank Negara, Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) and financial institutions yesterday launched the National Fraud Portal, an artificial intelligence-driven system that helps to strengthen the operational capabilities of the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC).
 The NFP automates the end-to-end process of handling scam reports and tracing of stolen funds by the NSRC.
 The process, which was manually done by the NSRC prior to this, vastly improves a victim’s chances of recovering funds should they fall prey to any scams.
 However, Bank Negara deputy governor Marzunisham Omar said it is important that reports pertaining to scammed funds be lodged as quickly as possible after it is discoverd by making a call the NSRC’s 997 hotline or bank hotlines.
 “Whenever a scam happens, the funds are withdrawn from the victim’s accounts and transferred to the mule accounts. 
 “In a matter of seconds or minutes, this will move from one account to another. When we started NSRC, most of the tracing was done manually. 
 “Let’s say the money is at Bank A, we will manually need to call them. Or if it has moved to Bank B or Bank C, we will quickly need to call them manually to hold the funds,” Marzunisham said at a press briefing yesterday.
 “But now we are automating this process, there is no need for calls any more. So we can trace these funds quickly. 
 “But the important thing is the victim must report it to the NSRC very quickly, if not the money will be moved and withdrawn then it is lost,” he added.
 He said the system is also expected to promote industry-wide information sharing and collaboration, enabling financial institutions to exchange details and intelligence regarding online fraud incidents, which also involves mule accounts.
 The NFP would also standardise the industry’s approach to handling mule accounts, ensuring that account holders affected by such activities continue to have access to essential financial services.
 Along with the NFP, the financial industry has also agreed to adopt industry-wide procedures for reporting and handling mule accounts. 
 The procedures enhance the quality of industry-wide information on mule accounts through streamlined classification, the NSRC said. 
 It also standardises the industry’s approach towards treating mules to ensure account holders affected by the activities of mule accounts can continue to access basic financial services, NSRC added.

 The celebrities urge the public to be extra mindful of content  they see online and always cross-check the information to avoid falling for scams.
 Popular singer Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza Tarudin became one of the affected celebrities when her voice was exploited by scammers using AI to replicate her appearance and speech.
 She urged social media users, particularly the elderly, to be wary of such scams.
 “The use of other people’s images by AI to deceive the public is widespread, and I am among those whose image and voice have been exploited.
 “In my opinion, social media users need to be more aware because most of the targets are the elderly, who the scammers find are easily deceived.
 “Some use my voice and videos for contests, while others contact social media users and pretend to be me speaking to them,” she said when contacted.
 Siti Nurhaliza has asked the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to work with the public to address the issue and stop further harm.
 In July, the singer was reported saying a video call featuring herself, which turned out to be AI-generated, made its rounds on social media.
 Her likeness has also been used to promote products, such as bedsheets, on social media.
 She took to social media to warn her fans not to fall victim to such fraudulent schemes.
 Popular online cooking personality Khairul Aming was also not spared the danger of AI-generated content.
 Recently, an almost one-minute-­long video used Khairul Aming’s voice and likeness to persuade fans to purchase woks from him to help fund repairs for his warehouse.
 The online influencer highlighted the incident via his official TikTok page, warning his followers that his image had been manipulated to create such content.
 “I just want to remind you guys to be careful, as slanderous content has now become widespread and AI tools have been misused in so many ways.
 “You may see postings featuring someone’s likeness, but it is not actually them. So please be aware,” he said in a TikTok video.
 Khairul Aming also urged the public to keep themselves safe by verifying the information they consume online before making any purchases.
 In June, former shuttler Datuk Lee Chong Wei expressed his shock upon seeing a video showing an altered footage of himself promoting a “financial scheme”.
 “It’s crazy what the scammers are doing these days. 
 “I’m shocked to see this fake video of me promoting a certain financial programme,” Lee said in a Facebook post.
 Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil urged social media platforms to put an AI label or notification on all AI-generated content to prevent untoward incidents.

 But the artificial intelligence tool used to create the harmful deepfakes is still easily accessible on the internet, promising to “undress any photo” uploaded to the website within seconds.
 Now a new effort to shut down the app and others like it is being pursued in California, where San Francisco this week filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that experts say could set a precedent but will also face many hurdles.
 “The proliferation of these images has exploited a shocking number of women and girls across the globe,” said David Chiu, the elected city attorney of San Francisco who brought the case against a group of widely visited websites based in Estonia, Serbia, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
 “These images are used to bully, humiliate and threaten women and girls,” he said. “And the impact on the victims has been devastating on their reputation, mental health, loss of autonomy, and in some instances, causing some to become suicidal.”
 The lawsuit brought on behalf of the people of California alleges that the services broke numerous state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. But it can be hard to determine who runs the apps, which are unavailable in phone app stores but still easily found on the internet.
 One service claimed by email that its “CEO is based and moves throughout the USA” but declined to provide any evidence or answer other questions.

 He said the platform operators should be held responsible for incidents happening on their platforms.
 “If their content was produced using Generative AI technology, then it is only right for the platforms to put a label or notification with words like ‘generated by artificial intelligence’.
 “This is one of the reasons why we will eventually license all social media platforms ... because we want them to be responsible when there are incidents like this,” he said in reference to the incident involving social media influencer Khairul Aming who became a victim of a fake video made using deepfake technology, Bernama reported.
 Fahmi clarified that he had never issued a directive to Google to deactivate the ringgit currency exchange rate graph feature as claimed by a user on X.
 “I have never instructed Google to remove their foreign exchange tool or widget from their  platform. When we search on Google, we can still get foreign exchange information.
 “But we need to remember that there was an incident last month where there was an inaccurate ringgit exchange rate published by Google, which was different from what was published by Bank Negara,” he said.
 Recently, a post claiming that Fahmi had instructed Google to take down the foreign exchange widget triggered various reactions on X.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi said the Online Safety Bill was expected to be tabled in the coming Parliament meeting in October.
 He said the Bill was being refined by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, in collaboration with the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).
 He said the Bill aligned with the government’s intention to license social media platforms as part of efforts to address issues related to online platforms.
 “This matter (the Bill) is being discussed continuously, and we have a special committee involving several ministries ... we expect that at least an Online Safety Bill can be brought to Parliament soon.

717682,StarBiz,11,13/08/2024,Lenovo transforms traditional industries through AI and data,,"BEIJING: Sany Heavy Industry has integrated data from over 100 different applications into a centralised system, generating more than 1.2 trillion data points in the past year alone.
 This has led to a 30% increase in efficiency, a 50% lift in production capacity, a 60% reduction in labour utility and a 30% reduction in space usage, the Chinese heavy machinery maker said.
 Of course, behind these achievements is a partnership between Sany and Chinese tech company Lenovo that is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise industrial processes and resource management.
 This is part of Lenovo’s broader push to spearhead the integration of AI into traditional industries, significantly enhancing efficiency and productivity across sectors.
 Through its AI technologies and comprehensive solutions, Lenovo aims to pave the way for a new era of smart transformation.
 Liu Jun, executive vice-president of Lenovo Group and president of Lenovo China, said the company remains committed to its strategic vision of “Smarter AI for All”.“We want to harness the potential of AI to accelerate the smart transformation and upgrade of public organisations, large, small and medium enterprises and consumer clients,” Liu said.
 According to him, the company will collaborate with partners to advance China’s push to nurture new quality productive forces and contribute to the high-quality development of the Chinese economy.
 Jin Zhuanglong, minister of industry and information technology, said previously that China’s traditional industries are vast and account for over 80% of the manufacturing sector. 
 These include steel, nonferrous metals, petrochemicals, building materials, light industry, machinery, textiles and apparel, foods and traditional Chinese medicine.
 These traditional sectors forming the foundation of the modern industrial system, are crucial for economic development and people’s livelihood, and are essential for maintaining China’s status as the world’s leading manufacturer, Jin said.
 “Regardless of the present or the future, traditional industries should not be simply labelled as ‘low-end industries’ and phased out. 
 “We must prioritise the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, employing a set of ‘comprehensive measures’ to accelerate their development toward higher-end, smarter and greener directions, allowing traditional industries to ‘blossom anew’,” Jin added.
 That is exactly what Lenovo aims to support.
 At Qingdao Special Iron and Steel Co Ltd, for instance, Lenovo’s self-developed Daystar AI vision inspection system has replaced workers who monitor production lines. 
 This system automatically identifies and alerts operational issues on the production line, providing high-quality monitoring and early warning capabilities without being affected by fatigue or emotional factors.Operating around the clock, the system ensures consistent and reliable supervision, highlighting the advantages of AI in maintaining quality control in manufacturing environments, Qingdao Special Iron and Steel said.
 Lenovo is also leveraging technology to help the academic sector boost its efficiency.At Nanjing University, Lenovo has established the second phase of the university’s high-performance computing centre. 
 Over the past six years, the system has operated with a stability rate above 99% and in the past three years, the utilisation rate of central processing units has exceeded 93%.
 This demonstrates the company’s capabilities in providing robust and efficient computing solutions for research and educational institutions, Lenovo said.
 These examples are part of Lenovo’s broader initiative to drive functional upgrades in traditional industries through AI and data technology.

 Leading critical digital infrastructure provider Vertiv is among the companies that are hoping to help in this regard by highlighting the impact AI can have on sustainable and responsible data centre operations.
 Vertiv Malaysia sales director Teoh Wooi Keat (pic) described AI as the “reinvention” of the Internet.
 “It will be akin to the ewallet revolution, which has taken the world by storm after it saw ­gradual widespread introduction across all sectors following the (Covid-19) pandemic,” he said during a presentation he made on AI’s impact on responsible data centre operations on Wednesday.
 Teoh said to keep up with this revolution, more efficient and accelerated IT architectures are needed for data centres to meet the requirements of AI workloads.
 “AI workloads will require complex calculations with billions of parameters leading to the need for more high-bandwidth memory (HBM) of up to 800Gbps (gigabits per second).
 “This is significantly higher compared with the conventional and currently widely-used Double Data Rate 5 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR5 SDRAM) with max speeds of 50Gbps that we have now.
 “Storage capacities will also need to be improved with current data created yearly already exceeding the 100-zettabyte mark and generative AI expected to further accelerate this trend.
 “Networking must also be accelerated as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Networking and AI accelerated instances run on network speeds of 1,600Gbps compared with the traditional instances of 1-10Gbps,” he added.
 A zettabyte is one trillion gigabytes.
 Teoh said with this sudden jump in requirements, AI was bringing in considerable uncertainty to once-proven infrastructure design practices for data centres.
 “Most database racks currently run loads of up to 20 kilowatts (kW) but 80% of IT managers have agreed that rack densities are going up as AI adoption changes the amount of computing power needed per rack.
 “In two years, racks are expected to run loads of 40kW and four years later, it may be common for all racks to run loads of up to 80kW, which increases energy usage and heat generated.
 “This sharp spike means simply beefing up existing cooling and energy supply solutions to meet the demands of AI workloads at data centres may no longer make economic sense.
 “Instead, accelerated AI thermal management solutions – which use precision air-conditioning combined with direct-to-chip and immersion cooling – will be the way forward to cool AI databases both effectively and efficiently,” he added.
 To this end, Teoh also presented what stakeholders need to consider when designing future AI-based data centres in the country.
 First is to design AI-based data centres’ power and cooling as a single system, with system-level controls to optimise performance and avoid inefficient use or underutilisation of resources in both areas.
 “By doing this, these infrastructures should also be designed to be able to handle highly dynamic workloads that are expected of AI-based systems, which can surge by as much as 150%.
 “These systems should also be designed for modularity and scalability that enable accelerated future design deployment, making them future-ready to support potential growth of up to 500kW per database rack,” he added.
 With this in mind, Teoh said Vertiv is working closely with technology giants Nvidia and Intel to develop power and cooling infrastructure to support their latest, highest-grade AI solutions.
 “With Nvidia, the team came up with a novel approach combining two data centre liquid cooling technologies into a single system that has never been seen before.
 “Entire servers, with their lower power components, were encased in hermetically-sealed containers and immersed in coolant.
 “With Intel, its Gaudi3 AI accelerator was designed to enable both liquid-cooled and air-cooled servers, supported by Vertiv-pumped two-phase (P2P) cooling infrastructure, that recycles coolant,” he added.",kuala lumpur adapt incorporate artificial intelligence data centre system key malaysia meeting aspiration regional data centre hub industry player critical digital infrastructure provider vertiv company regard impact sustainable responsible data centre operation malaysia sale director wooi keat pic reinvention internet akin ewallet revolution storm gradual widespread introduction sector pandemic presentation impact responsible data centre operation teoh revolution efficient architecture data centre meet requirement workload workload complex calculation billion parameter bandwidth memory hbm gbps gigabit conventional double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory ddr sdram max speed gbps storage capacity current data zettabyte mark generative accelerate trend networking oracle cloud infrastructure instance network speed gbps traditional instance zettabyte gigabyte teoh sudden jump requirement considerable uncertainty proven infrastructure design practice centre rack kilowatt manager rack density adoption amount power rack rack load common rack increase energy usage heat sharp spike energy supply solution demand workload data centre economic sense thermal management solution air conditioning direct chip immersion cool database teoh stakeholder future data centre country design data centre power single system system level control performance avoid inefficient underutilisation resource infrastructure handle dynamic workload system surge system modularity scalability enable accelerated future design deployment future ready support potential growth database rack mind teoh vertiv technology giant intel power infrastructure support solution team approach data centre liquid technology single system entire server lower power component container coolant intel gaudi accelerator enable liquid air server vertiv phase infrastructure recycles,"[(13, 0.33882943), (14, 0.6573655)]",14
716016,Main,23,09/08/2024,AI-generated articles land leading Aussie magazine  in hot water,,"Sydney: One of Australia’s leading science magazines drew fire after publishing AI-generated articles that experts said were incorrect or oversimplified.
 Cosmos, published by Aust­ralia’s state-backed national science agency, used Open AI’s GPT-4 to produce six articles published last month.
 Although the use of artificial intelligence was disclosed, the Science Journalists Association of Australia said its use had caused serious concerns.
 Association president Jackson Ryan said that in the AI-generated Cosmos article ‘What happens  to our bodies after death?’, the descriptions of scientific processes were incorrect or vastly simplified.
 In one example, the AI service wrote that rigor mortis sets in 3 to 4 hours after death. 
 Ryan said scientific research shows the timing to be less definitive.
 Another example included the description of autolysis – a process in which cells are destroyed by their enzymes – which the article described as “self-breaking”.
 Ryan said this was a poor description of the process.
 He said generally, these inaccuracies would damage people’s trust in and perception of the publication.
 A spokesperson for the national science agency said that the AI content had been fact-checked by a “trained science communicator and edited by the Cosmos publishing team”.
 Cosmos would continue to review the use of the AI service throughout the experiment, the spokesperson added.
 The magazine has drawn further criticism for using a journalism grant to develop its artificial intelligence capabilities, which could come at the expense of journalists.
 Cosmos’ former editor Gail MacCallum told Australia’s national broadcaster ABC that while she was a “huge proponent of exploring AI”, having it create articles was “past my comfort zone”.
 Another former editor of Cosmos, Ian Connellan, told the ABC he had not been informed  of the AI project and, if he had, he’d have advised it was a “bad idea”.
 The use of AI is becoming a major battleground for publishers and musicians.
 The New York Times recently sued ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Microsoft in a US court, alleging that the companies’ powerful AI models used millions of articles for training without permission from its authors.

 The research house continued to favour Axiata for its growth prospects for telecommunication companies (telcos) and tower assets in emerging markets, as well as strong asset monetisation prospects for telecommunications tower company Edotco Group and its digital businesses.
 The telco will be able to better capitalise its growth prospects, given that it plans to deleverage and strengthen its balance sheet.
 As such, the research house has maintained its “outperform” call and sum-of-parts target price of RM3 for the stock.
 Risks to its call include a strong US dollar as this may weigh on the performance of its telcos in frontier markets such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.
 The research house added that gestational earnings and cash flow drag from Indonesian unit PT Link Net Tbk’s aggressive expansion and capital expenditure up-cycle due to the looming implementation of 5G in Indonesia could also affect its call.
 “We came away from Axiata’s IDEAS@ Axiata 2024 forum earlier this week with a neutral perspective, as it is still early to gauge the full impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
 “In the future, Axiata may deploy customer service AI agents capable of human-like interactions with its customers.
 “Additionally, we believe CelcomDigi Bhd may market customised AI models and applications to Malaysian enterprises via its partnerships with global cloud providers,” it added.
 The research house said enterprises and organisations can build and deploy customised AI models by integrating their respective data lakes with foundation models from various AI providers as a starting base.
 “These customised models undergo fine-tuning and may use retrieval augmented generation to enhance the accuracy and relevance of outputs.
 “Axiata is optimistic about leveraging AI to develop customer service chatbots capable of human-like interactions for both its telcos and Axiata Digital Analytics customers,” Kenanga Research said.
 It added that while Axiata is proactively investing in the deployment of AI, its direct costs are marginal relative to the group’s total operating expenditure and capital expenditure.
 “The bulk of Axiata’s AI investments are largely channelled into its AI factory and staff training. There are currently more than a hundred AI models in Axiata’s AI factory and placed in the group’s major operation companies,” the research house added.",jaya plenty reason bhd house favour axiata growth prospect telecommunication company tower asset market strong asset monetisation prospect telecommunication company edotco digital business capitalise growth prospect deleverage strengthen balance sheet house call sum target price stock risk strong dollar weigh performance telco frontier market sri lanka cambodia house gestational earnings cash flow indonesian unit link net tbk aggressive expansion capital expenditure cycle implementation indonesia call axiata idea forum week neutral perspective gauge impact generative artificial intelligence future axiata deploy customer service agent capable human interaction customer bhd market model application malaysian enterprise partnership global cloud provider house organisation deploy model respective data lake foundation model provider base model undergo fine retrieval generation enhance accuracy relevance output optimistic leveraging customer service chatbots capable human interaction axiata digital analytics customer axiata deployment direct cost marginal relative total operating expenditure capital expenditure bulk axiata investment factory staff training model factory major operation company house,"[(1, 0.99360543)]",1
714625,Main,24,06/08/2024,AI lies flooding feeds,Deluge of fakery raises voter manipulation fears in the US,"Washington: A “deepfake” video parodying Kamala Harris, a manipulated expletive-laden clip of Joe Biden and a doctored image of Donald Trump being arrested – a tide of AI-fuelled political disinformation has prompted alarm over its potential to manipulate voters as the US presidential race heats up.
 In what is widely billed as America’s first AI election in November, researchers warn that tech-enabled fakery could be used to steer voters toward or away from candidates – or even to avoid the polls altogether – ­stoking tensions in an already hyperpolarised environment.
 A recent wave of disinformation has renewed calls for tech giants – many of which have retreated from moderating social media content – to strengthen guardrails around generative artificial intelligence ahead of the vote.
 Last week, Elon Musk faced intense criticism for sharing a deepfake video featuring Vice President Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with his 192 million followers on X.
 In it, a voiceover mimicking Harris calls President Joe Biden senile; the voice then declares that she does not “know the first thing about running the country”.
 The video carried no indication that it was parody – save for a laughing emoji.
 Only later did Musk clarify that the video was meant as satire.
 Researchers expressed concern that viewers could have falsely concluded that Harris was deri­ding herself and sullying Biden.
 Last month, a manipulated video ricocheting across X appeared to show Biden cursing his critics – including using anti-LGBTQ slurs – after he announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination.
 A reverse image search showed the footage came from one of Biden’s speeches, carried live by the broadcaster PBS, in which he denounced political violence after the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump.
 Weeks earlier, an image shared across platforms appeared to show police forcibly arresting Trump after a New York jury found him guilty of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
 But the photo was a deepfake, digital forensics experts said.
 “These recent examples are highly representative of how deepfakes will be used in politics going forward,” said Lucas Hansen, co-founder of CivAI.
 “While AI-powered disinformation is certainly a concern, the most likely applications will be manufactured images and videos intended to provoke anger and worsen partisan tension.”
 Observers warn that such fake­ry on a mass scale risks igniting public anger at the electoral process. More than 50% of Americans expect AI-enabled falsehoods to impact who wins the 2024 election, according to a poll published last year by Axios and Morning Consult. — AFP",washington deepfake video kamala harris expletive laden clip joe biden image donald trump tide political disinformation alarm potential manipulate voter presidential race heat america election november researcher tech steer voter candidate poll tension environment wave disinformation tech giant social medium content strengthen guardrail generative artificial intelligence vote week elon musk intense criticism deepfake video vice president presumptive democratic nominee follower harris call president joe biden senile voice declares country video indication parody emoji musk clarify video satire researcher concern viewer harris deri biden month video ricocheting biden cursing critic anti lgbtq slur seek reelection democratic nomination reverse image search footage biden speech live broadcaster pb political violence july assassination attempt trump week image platform police trump york jury guilty falsifying business record money payment star stormy daniel deepfake digital forensics expert example representative deepfakes politics hansen founder civai disinformation concern application image video anger partisan tension observer fake mass scale risk public electoral process american falsehood impact win election poll axios morning consult afp,"[(7, 0.15392804), (9, 0.8406162)]",9
713931,Lifestyle,5,05/08/2024,The fussabout AI,The explosion of  artificial intelligence  in the years following  the launch of ChatGPT has not been free of controversy.,"WITH the jury still out on whether ­artificial intelligence (AI) has been a net positive or loss for humanity, there’s been a host of debates surrounding the technology alongside its rapid development and ­adoption.In the EU, for instance, companies are running into regulatory roadblocks over their non-compliance with data privacy regulations in the region.
 Meta announced back in June that it would be incorporating European users’ social media posts into its AI training data for the Llama AI model. With Llama being a multimodal AI, this would include everything from text and images to video and audio.
 Soon after, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) requested that the social media giant refrain from utilising the region’s social media content to train large language models, prompting Meta to delay its AI launch in the EU to the joy of other European regulators.
 Users in the UK and EU have the “right to object”, which would effectively opt them out from having their data used by Meta in training its AI model. However, the process has been described as tedious and awkward.Meanwhile, those in other regions ­without data protection regulations as stringent as the GDPR do not have this option, according to a report from online tech publication Mashable.
 X (formerly Twitter) made a similar move to utilise user posts in training its Grok AI model at the end of July, prompting the DPC and the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office to question the ­platform over the data harvesting.
 The Elon Musk-owned platform had users opt-in by default to allow for AI training on their data, which goes against the UK’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) according to a report from The Guardian.Under UK’s GDPR, companies are not allowed to implement consent by default, which is the case in X’s settings page.Mired in ­controversy
 Reports over the contents of training data fed into AI models have also been extensive, covering ­allegations of stolen and illicit content.
 Back in December last year, researchers from the Stanford Internet Observatory found that the Laion-5B dataset contained 1,679 illegal images consisting of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) scraped from social media posts and ­popular adult websites.This dataset was used to train the popular AI image generator Stable Diffusion.
 Further discussion over the datasets in AI training involves where the content is sourced from. Nonprofit EleutherAI compiled a massive dataset named “The Pile” which was reported in July to contain the captions of over 170,000 YouTube videos.
 These captions were taken without ­permission and allegedly used by major companies like Anthropic, Nvidia, and Salesforce.
 Initial reports had listed Apple as having used this stolen data in AI training, but the company has since refuted such claims.Content from influencers such as MrBeast, PewDiePie, Marques Brownlee and Jacksepticeye were included in the dataset, alongside various talk shows and news outlets such as Wall Street Journal, NPR, and the BBC.
 Brownlee’s videos were also allegedly subject to further use as training data for an AI video generation tool developed by Runway without consent, according to reports in late July. Reports say that 1,709 videos of his videos were used for AI training.Claims of outright copyright violation have also been the subject of legal battles in the AI space, with a coalition of music companies including Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records alleging that AI music generation companies Udio and Suno infringed on their copyright.The lawsuit claims that the AI firms trained their music-generation models using copyrighted materials owned by the music labels, seeking US$150,000 (RM674,805) in damages per song used in training.A similar lawsuit was also launched by the New York Times in the case of journalistic content against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI (and its owner Microsoft) last December and is currently ongoing. 
 Claims from the New York Times allege that copyrighted content from the American newspaper had been unlawfully used in developing artificial intelligence products that “threatens the Times’ ability to provide that service”.
 Both OpenAI and Microsoft have shot back that its products do not serve as a ­substitute for the reporting offered by the publication, requesting courts to dismiss the lawsuit.
 Other news providers such as the Associated Press, Axel Springer, FT Group, News Corp, and Vox Media have reached licensing deals with OpenAI, allowing their content to be used in the training of the company’s large language models (LLMs).
 More direct claims of plagiarism came from magazines Forbes and Wired in June, with accusations that AI search and ­chatbot startup Perplexity had been scraping ­content from the magazines’ respective websites.
 Forbes claimed that Perplexity had ­utilised AI to generate an article, podcast, and YouTube video based on a story that the publication put up on its website. This was done without permission from and attributing credit to Forbes for the original report.
 The publication further alleged to have found other plagiarised stories republished by Perplexity with uncited information sourced from Bloomberg and CNBC.
 Wired on the other hand claimed that Perplexity had been ignoring “robots.txt”, a file used in the Robots Exclusion Protocol intended to disallow web scrapers and crawlers, which the AI company said it honoured.
 In a report, the tech magazine claims that it monitored network traffic to its ­website and linked it to bots associated with Perplexity, following a prompt about an article published on its site.
 It further drew a ­comparison to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, which offered a hypothesis about the story in question, but explicitly stated that they did not have access to it.
 On July 30, the startup reached an agreement with several outlets including Time, Fortune, and Wordpress on a revenue-­sharing programme that would pay the publications for articles cited in AI-generated responses.",jury artificial intelligence net positive loss humanity host debate technology rapid development adoption instance company regulatory roadblock compliance data privacy regulation region meta june european user social medium post data llama model llama multimodal text image audio irish data protection commission dpc social medium giant utilising region social medium content train language model meta delay launch joy european regulator user data meta model process tedious awkward region protection regulation gdpr option report online tech publication mashable twitter move user post grok model july dpc commissioner office question platform data elon musk platform user default data data protection regulation report guardian gdpr company implement consent default setting controversy report content data model allegation illicit content december researcher internet observatory laion dataset illegal image child sexual abuse material csam social medium post popular adult website train popular image generator stable diffusion discussion datasets involves content nonprofit eleutherai massive dataset pile july caption video caption permission major company salesforce initial report apple data company claim content influencers pewdiepie marque jacksepticeye news outlet street journal npr bbc brownlee video subject training data video generation tool runway consent report late july report video claim copyright violation subject legal battle space coalition music company universal music sony music warner record music generation company copyright lawsuit firm music generation model material music label damage lawsuit york time journalistic content chatgpt maker openai owner microsoft december claim york time content american newspaper artificial intelligence product time ability service openai microsoft shot product substitute reporting publication court dismiss lawsuit news provider springer news corp vox medium deal content training company language model direct claim plagiarism magazine forbes june accusation search chatbot startup perplexity content magazine respective website forbes perplexity utilised generate article podcast youtube video story publication website permission credit forbes original report publication plagiarised story perplexity bloomberg cnbc hand perplexity robot file robot exclusion protocol disallow web scraper crawler company report tech magazine claim network traffic website bot perplexity prompt article site comparison openai chatgpt anthropic claude hypothesis story question access july startup agreement outlet time fortune wordpress revenue programme pay publication article response,"[(5, 0.9972296)]",5
713615,StarEdu,8,04/08/2024,Are we ready for AI in healthcare?,"Education for pharmacists must incorporate AI, data ethics and cybersecurity","Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising healthcare across multiple domains, from diagnosis to treatment.
 AI-powered devices and sensors can track patients’ health in real time, helping them stay on top of their medication and making healthcare more accessible, especially in remote areas.
 AI can also help develop new medicines by predicting drug efficacy and interactions. This makes the development process safer, faster and more efficient. 
 By taking over routine, non-clinical tasks, AI allows pharmacists to focus on what they do best – addressing patient-specific needs.
 However, for AI to be effective, it is crucial that the data it is based on is accurate and reliable. Without proper data preparation, AI recommendations can be flawed, leading to errors and inaccuracies.
 By investing in data quality initiatives, Malaysia can position itself at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
 High-quality data is essential for AI technologies to work accurately and reliably, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare.
 The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of being prepared for epidemics. AI can play a critical role in this by analysing patient data and environmental factors to predict disease outbreaks.
 It can also improve access to essential medicines and vaccines, and help distribute medical supplies more effectively.
 With AI, we can respond faster and more effectively to future health crises. While AI has many capabilities, these machines cannot replicate the judgement, empathy and expertise of a human pharmacist.
 Humans have a unique ability to observe and understand patient behaviour, and to empathise with them in a way that machines cannot. These observations are crucial in patient care.
 The growing amount of sensitive patient data, however, requires strong data privacy and cybersecurity measures to be in place. Most healthcare organisations are not equipped to handle such large amounts of data, making them vulnerable to data breaches.
 If we are not prepared, data breaches can have serious consequences, damaging our reputation and finances. With the rise of ransomware and cyberattacks, we need strict regulations to protect patient data. The question is: Are we ready to handle this challenge? Should companies be held accountable for protecting patient data, and face consequences if they fail?
 AI operates in a regulatory grey area, and its safety and robustness in healthcare models are often overlooked. This raises ethical concerns, particularly when AI-generated decisions conflict with patient preferences.
 The issue of malpractice is especially contentious, with debates over who is liable for life-threatening mistakes made by AI.
 Organisations also struggle with trusting AI decision-making tools, as over-reliance on AI recommendations can erode the critical thinking and judgement of healthcare professionals. Moreover, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data is biased, the AI model will be too.
 This raises important questions about accountability: How can we ensure that healthcare providers are responsible for their AI models and the data they use? And who is liable when AI-driven decisions lead to negative consequences?
 The future of healthcare lies in education that combines human expertise with AI. As patient care becomes increasingly reliant on AI, pharmacists are more crucial than ever for their human insight and oversight.
 To succeed, pharmacists must be AI-aware, and this requires education that incorporates AI fundamentals, data ethics and cybersecurity.

713039,StarBiz,2,02/08/2024,Pentamaster optimistic about the expanding role of AI,,"PETALING JAYA: Pentamaster Corp Bhd continues to identify growth drivers such as artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, automotive electrification, and medical automation to drive its business momentum forward.
 The company is particularly optimistic about the expanding role of AI in cloud and data centres as this trend is expected to create significant opportunities for the demand of the group’s test equipment used in advanced semiconductor packaging.
 “The increasing adoption of silicon carbide-based power solutions across various applications, particularly in data centres and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chipset is gaining momentum,” Pentamaster said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
 The trend is expected to generate an uptick in demand for the group’s wafer-level burn-in tester for silicon carbide, besides test handler solutions for advanced semiconductor packaging in dynamic random access memory as well as HBM.
 “The global semiconductor industry is demonstrating its strong fundamentals and growth potential supporting the diverse range of disruptive applications emerging from the AI wave.
 “As forecast, the semiconductor test equipment are projected to rise 7.4% in 2024, while assembly and packaging equipment sales are predicted to increase 10% for the same period, and this momentum shall continue into 2025 due to increased demand for advanced logic and memory applications,” Pentamaster stated in its filing.
 Despite market fluctuations and industry challenges, Pentamaster recognised the strong foundation of the electric vehicle (EV) market, supported by regulations, expanding charging infrastructure, industry investments, and growing consumer demand for affordable, eco-friendly options.
 “These ongoing developments are expected to sustain a considerable amount of business opportunities for the group to navigate uncertainties and capitalise on emerging prospects,” it said.
 Meanwhile, for the second quarter ended June 30 (2Q24), Pentamaster’s net profit fell 15.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM19.9mil or earnings per share (EPS) of 2.8 sen as revenue fell by 3% to RM171.4mil.
 The drop in topline number was due to a drop in its automated test equipment (ATE) segment while earnings were hit by lower ATE sales volume, increased employee expenses, provisions for slow-moving inventories and research and development expenditures for certain projects undertaken in the ATE segment. 
 The fall in profit was cushioned by the strong growth in its factory automation solutions (FAS) segment, its filing noted.
 Pentamsater’s revenue was mainly contributed by the ATE and FAS segments, constituting 40.7% and 59.3% respectively in 2Q24. 
 For the first half, it posted a 13% y-o-y lower net profit of RM39.3mil or EPS of 5.52 sen while revenue was flat at RM342.16mil y-o-y.
 Pentamaster said although the group expects a challenging business environment in the second half of the year, it remains steadfast in its commitment to demonstrating resilience and agility in navigating this complex landscape.
 “The group’s primary focus is to ensure its core businesses remain robust and adaptable in the face of these challenges while continuing to pursue business diversification to explore new opportunities within its established markets.

712601,StarMetro,3,01/08/2024,‘Expand AI cameras to other local councils’,,"THE installation of artificial intelligence (AI) closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) should be expanded to include other local authorities in Johor as it can provide better security coverage for all.
 Applauding the state government for incorporating the latest technology to address public safety concerns, Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation (MCPF) Johor chapter chairman Datuk Tee Siew Kiong said  using AI technology in various fields including security was a global trend.
 “It is good that Johor government is proactive in this. 
 “Addressing security concerns can help Johor attract more investments into the state, as foreign investors always highlight safety before making a decision to invest,” he told StarMetro.
 Tee added that this was vital in the state government’s plan to make Johor a developed state by 2030.
 Among key steps to achieve this was the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), while the movement of travellers between Johor and Singapore would surely increase with the Rapid Transit System Link (RTS) being operational by 2027, he said.
 “Both the JS-SEZ and RTS will bring in more investments into the state. By having the AI CCTV in place, it will surely ease safety concerns among investors.
 “It will definitely help change any negative perception of Johor Baru as the state government is taking positive steps through the AI CCTV,” he added.
 Tee said the four local councils and police could work closely through the smart intelligence operation centres (SIOC).
 “I believe criminals will have to think twice before committing a crime as their act would be caught on camera.”
 Tee said with AI technology, local councils would not need a lot of manpower on duty at their respective SIOC.
 “That extra manpower can be sent to other departments and the local councils can focus on other services that can improve the people’s well-being.”
 Tee, however, urged the  state government to widen  the coverage of AI CCTV to  other locations outside Greater Johor Baru.
 He said many countries had adopted AI technology as part of their safety features.
 “For example, all the major cities in China have already installed AI CCTV that help the authorities keep a close watch on things.
 “Once the AI CCTV is proven to be a helpful tool in fighting crime, it should be installed at other districts in Johor.”
 Tee urged other local councils to also instal such cameras in areas under their jurisdiction. 
 Fighting crime, he said, should not fall on the shoulders of the authorities alone and called on the public to be more proactive.
 “Everyone should play a bigger role in helping the authorities fight crime including preventing it.
 “People nowadays have smartphones at their disposal and they should immediately contact the police by giving  out important and valuable information. 
 “If they see a crime happening in front of their eyes, they should record it on their mobile phones and give the recording to the police,” he said. — By MOHD FARHAAN SHAH",installation artificial intelligence circuit television camera expanded local authority provide security coverage government technology address public safety concern malaysian crime prevention foundation mcpf johor chapter chairman tee siew kiong technology field security global trend johor government proactive security concern johor attract investment foreign investor safety decision starmetro tee vital government plan johor key step johor singapore special economic zone sez movement traveller surely increase rapid transit system link operational sez rts investment cctv ease safety concern investor negative perception johor baru government positive step cctv tee local council police smart intelligence operation centre criminal crime caught camera tee technology local council lot manpower duty respective sioc extra manpower department local council focus service people urged government widen coverage cctv location johor baru country technology safety feature major city cctv authority cctv helpful tool crime installed district johor tee local council instal camera jurisdiction crime fall shoulder authority public proactive play bigger role authority crime people nowadays smartphones contact police valuable crime front eye record mobile phone police mohd farhaan shah,"[(5, 0.99416476)]",5
712337,StarBiz,8,31/07/2024,Tech titan bets big  with ambitious AI vision,Kasikorn group unveils inclusive plans for technology,"BANGKOK: Group chairman of Kasikorn Business-Technology Group (KBTG), Ruangroj Poonpol, delivered a powerful speech at the second annual KBTG Techtopia, Thailand’s largest technology conference, outlining the company’s aggressive vision and commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) development.
 This year’s event, themed “A Blast From the Future”, delved into the likely future with over 50 leading experts from Thailand and abroad sharing their insights on AI and game-changing technologies.
 The event also showcased several cutting-edge use cases from KBTG (THaLLE, Finly, FinLearn, Luna and Future you), allowing participants to envision the immense potential of the next wave of AI and other technologies.
 This year’s conference was made even more special by the appearance of Dr Andrew Ng, one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential figures in the AI world. He presented his insights in a talk titled “The Opportunities and sisks of AI”.
 The speech focused on AI risks and opportunities, future AI development trends, and strategies for launching successful startups and fostering growth in Thailand. 
 Underscoring KBTG’s commitment to going “all-in” on democratising AI technology under the banner “AI for all”, Ruangroj, also known as Krating, announced the signing of two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with Ng’s AI Fund and DeepLearning.AI. 
 The collaboration aims to accelerate AI adoption in Thailand by unlocking the synergy between powerful AI tools and empowering Thais to leverage AI effectively.
 The two MoUs aim to form a partnership to drive AI education in Thailand.
 The first is a collaboration between KBTG, DeepLearning.Ai, and AIAT to develop the KBTG.AI Kampus programme, which will support the Super AI Engineer Bootcamp. 
 The programme not only provides experts, tools, and training courses to incubate super AI engineers, but also provides AI curriculum support and consultation to Thai universities and government agencies.
 Founded by Ng, DeepLearning.AI provides essential online courses, knowledge, and tools to help people understand AI fundamentals and improve their AI skills and productivity.
 The second MoU focuses on a partnership between KBTG, AI Fund, and the Equitable Education Fund (EEF) to develop an AI assistant specifically designed for youth education. 
 The collaborative effort aims to explore the co-creation of AI solutions alongside all three parties to address the challenges of mental health and educational equity in Thailand.
 Sharing a common passion for AI and education, KBank and KBTG have partnered to ensure that the collaboration benefits not only themselves but also Thailand’s entire AI ecosystem, fostering growth in both the education and startup sectors and propelling the country towards becoming a global leader in AI technology.
 Prior to the event, KXVC, the venture capital arm of KBTG, announced its new strategic partnership aimed at growing and scaling new AI companies and startups in Thailand. 
 Committed partner
 By combining AI Fund’s venture studio model with KBTG’s cutting-edge technological expertise – a powerful force in South-East Asia’s tech scene – the  partnership aims to tackle real-world challenges through innovative new solutions. AI Fund and KXVC will join forces to build new companies and forge stronger connections within their ecosystems.
 While AI isn’t a new concept, Ruangroj argues that we are currently experiencing a peak in its transformative power. Advancements in areas like generative AI, computer vision with large language models, and composite AI all point towards this.
 The surge in capability is leading to a wave of enthusiasm for AI adoption, with both individuals and businesses eager to leverage its potential. 
 Speaking on stage at the KBTG Techtopia event on the topic “Transform to Thrive in the Age of AI”, he forecast that by 2030, domain-specific AI or vertical AI will dominate every industry. 
 He said domain-specific AI would equip businesses with deep knowledge of their specific field, allowing them to address unique challenges. 
 The approach offers advantages like tackling specific needs and meeting domain-specific challenges more effectively with less cost and resources. 
 Furthermore, vertical AI often utilises a “multimodal” approach, meaning it can work with various data types for a more comprehensive understanding. 
 In some cases, it can even involve “multi-agent systems”, where multiple AI programs collaborate on complex tasks. The collaborative approach further enhances vertical AI’s problem-solving capabilities.
 While encouraging everyone and every business to engage AI as a companion and to embrace changes with an open mind, as demonstrated at KBTG, which has always been a pioneer in AI, he advised patience, curiosity and responsibility. 
 KBTG’s core transformation concept, “Human First, AI First”, exemplifies this approach. Ruangroj explained that the company prioritises humans as the centre for unlocking business and customer impact. By 2027, they aim to achieve this through AI-powered revenue generation, product innovation, and productivity improvements.
 However, KBTG’s ambitions extend beyond the company itself.
 Ruangroj emphasised their commitment to an “all-in” strategy, aiming to bring all Thais on board to benefit from AI technology. He cited the two MoUs KBTG had signed with AI Fund as evidence of its dedication to Thailand.
 AI Fund footprint
 Emphasising his firm belief in Thailand’s potential, Andrew Ng, a prominent figure in AI and managing general partner of AI Fund, praised the country as a top destination for the AI industry in the Asean region. 
 Ng’s visit aimed to explore opportunities for AI Fund to contribute to Thailand’s AI development through strategic partnerships. 
 He stated that technology is an essential foundation for all types of businesses. AI and smart technology are applicable to both small and medium businesses and large corporations.
 He expressed an interest in sharing his expertise in AI training to strengthen the Thai workforce and improve education quality in AI fields, which aligns with the “Ignite Thailand” vision of becoming a digital-economy hub.
 This reflected his intention to collaborate with KBTG and KXVC to improve AI education in Thailand while also exploring potential partnerships with Thai businesses and entrepreneurs. 
 To demonstrate his commitment, he held meetings with Thailand’s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, the Minister Education, the Minister Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation,  and other senior officials. — The Nation/ANN",bangkok chairman business technology kbtg ruangroj poonpol powerful speech annual kbtg techtopia largest technology conference company aggressive vision commitment artificial intelligence development event blast future future expert insight game technology event edge thalle finlearn luna future participant envision potential wave technology conference special appearance time magazine influential figure insight talk opportunity speech risk opportunity development trend strategy successful startup growth thailand kbtg commitment technology banner ruangroj krating memorandum mous fund deeplearning collaboration aim adoption thailand synergy powerful tool thai leverage mous aim form partnership drive education thailand collaboration aiat kbtg kampus programme support super engineer bootcamp programme expert training course super engineer curriculum support consultation thai university government agency essential online course tool people fundamental skill productivity mou partnership kbtg fund equitable education fund eef assistant education collaborative effort aim creation solution party address challenge health educational equity thailand common passion education kbtg partnered collaboration benefit entire ecosystem growth education startup sector country global leader technology prior event kxvc venture capital arm kbtg strategic partnership company partner fund venture studio model edge technological expertise powerful force south east asia tech scene partnership tackle real challenge innovative solution fund kxvc join force company stronger connection concept ruangroj transformative power advancement generative computer vision language model surge capability enthusiasm adoption individual business eager leverage potential speaking stage techtopia event topic transform thrive age forecast domain specific vertical dominate industry domain specific equip business knowledge specific field address unique challenge offer advantage specific meeting domain specific cost resource vertical utilises approach meaning data type comprehensive understanding involve multi agent system multiple program complex task collaborative approach vertical capability business engage companion embrace mind kbtg pioneer patience curiosity responsibility kbtg core transformation concept human exemplifies ruangroj company prioritises human business customer impact aim revenue generation product innovation productivity improvement ambition company ruangroj commitment strategy thai board benefit technology mous kbtg fund evidence dedication thailand fund footprint firm belief potential andrew prominent figure partner fund country top destination industry asean region visit opportunity fund contribute thailand development strategic partnership technology essential foundation type business smart technology applicable medium business corporation expertise training strengthen thai workforce education quality field aligns ignite thailand vision digital economy hub intention collaborate kbtg kxvc education thailand potential partnership business demonstrate commitment meeting prime minister srettha thavisin minister education minister education science innovation senior official nation,"[(3, 0.5100658), (7, 0.48761576)]",3
712329,StarBiz,9,31/07/2024,Boost in trading as brokers leverage AI to help investors,,"SINGAPORE: Stock brokerages are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to pick and analyse stocks in an attempt to draw tech-native young investors. 
 While doing so, they find they have an audience among more seasoned users as well.
 One of those leading the charge is OCBC Securities, which in June launched AI Oscar, short for AI OCBC Securities’ Customer Artificial Intelligence Radar.
 The stock-picking tool uses deep-learning to identify and predict stock price movements, unlike other AI programs that make decisions based on a set of pre-determined criteria, said OCBC Securities managing director Wilson He.
 Deep learning is the process where artificial neural networks – algorithms that mimic the way the human brain works – process data from multiple sources and analyse the information in real time.
 Other online trading platforms are also using predictive analytics to help forecast market trends and identify stock picks for customers.
 All the brokerages have developed some form of educational content for investors to help them comprehend difficult financial concepts.
 Tiger Brokers integrated these capabilities with TigerGPT, an AI-powered chatbot in the Tiger Trade app.
 Its market strategist James Ooi said this makes it easier for a Tiger user to read up on information related to the stocks he is interested in, the companies’ financial numbers and trending market topics. The chatbot also answers any queries that investors have.
 As for FSMOne.com, its general manager Joshua Chim said the online investment platform has a stock/exchange-traded fund selector function, which helps to filter choices based on criteria like desired investment themes. 
 This narrows down the selection process – from the whole universe of Singapore Exchange-listed stocks to a certain number of companies, for example.
 OCBC Securities said AI Oscar takes stock-picking and analysis to the next level as it learns from an investor’s behaviour, his trading patterns, his risk appetite and his past trading activity.
 It then comes up with a personalised report of 15 different stock ideas for each customer every week – five each for Singapore, Hong Kong and United States – the three most popular markets among Singapore investors.
 He of OCBC Securities added that each stock recommendation comes with a research report, price and company-specific information.
 Jayzee Poh, 32, who has been investing in the markets for the past nine years, said he started using AI Oscar two months ago to supplement his decision-making.

712497,Main,21,31/07/2024,The other side of the AI coin,Cybersecurity fears over rogue versions of tools being sold on the Dark Web,"As students and workers harness generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for their studies and work, so, too, have crooks.Underground forums are selling modified versions of ChatGPT that circumvent safety filters to generate scam content, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said in its Singapore Cyber Landscape report for 2023, published yesterday.
 FraudGPT and WormGPT, two modified versions of OpenAI’s chatbot, have been reportedly sold to more than 3,000 customers globally since July 2023, raising fears that generative AI could herald a wave of cyber attacks, scams and falsehoods.
 FraudGPT is marketed on the Dark Web as a tool to learn how  to hack, and write malware and malicious code. 
 WormGPT was developed to circumvent ChatGPT’s guard rails, such as prohibition against the generation of phishing e-mails or writing malware code.
 Roughly 13% of phishing scams in 2023 analysed by CSA showed signs that they were likely made with AI.
 Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT launch in late 2022, cybersecurity firms have reported a growing trend of hackers using the AI tool to gather critical details about software to find vulnerabilities in companies’ systems that can be exploited.
 Microsoft, for example, disclosed that bad actors had used  AI to study technical protocols for military-related equipment such as radars and satellites, illustrating how AI can be used in reconnaissance before an attack is staged.
 Cracked chatbots continue to emerge despite efforts to clamp down on them. The Telegram channel promoting WormGPT was shut down, only for other similar tools to appear elsewhere.
 AI-powered password generators like PassGAN, which can be deployed at scale, can also crack more than half of common passwords in under a minute.
 Another way the technology is deployed maliciously is in the generation of deepfake images to bypass biometric authentication. 
 For example, to beat the use of facial recognition as a security feature, fraudsters turn to face- swapping apps.
 There is a growing underground market of criminal developers peddling impersonation services that employ deepfakes, fake social media accounts and AI-generated spam content that can bypass anti-phishing controls of popular e-mail services, and can be used to deploy scam campaigns, said CSA. 
 Despite concerns about AI, the very same technology is being used by the cyber security sector to combat scams.
 “Through machine learning and algorithms, AI can be trained to detect deepfakes, phishing e-mails and suspicious activities,” said CSA.
 Algorithms can be trained to spot unnatural facial movements, lighting discrepancies and irregularities in eye reflections, which are all tell-tale signs of deepfakes, said CSA.
 But developers face challenges in using AI for cyber security, such as false positives, false negatives, and an arms race against cyber criminals that may be unsustainable in the long run for many organisations.
 “As law enforcement (agencies train) their AI systems, cyber criminals can also actively develop methods to evade and fool AI detection systems,” CSA said. 
 “This can result in a fast-paced, resource-intensive arms race in which AI systems constantly adapt.” — The Straits Times/ANN",student worker harness generative artificial intelligence tool study underground forum modified version circumvent safety filter scam content cyber security agency csa singapore cyber landscape report yesterday version chatbot customer fear generative herald cyber attack falsehood dark web tool learn hack write malware malicious code wormgpt circumvent chatgpt guard prohibition generation mail malware code scam csa sign openai chatgpt launch late cybersecurity firm trend hacker tool critical detail software company system microsoft bad actor technical protocol military equipment radar reconnaissance attack cracked chatbots effort telegram channel wormgpt shut tool password generator scale crack half common password minute technology generation deepfake image biometric authentication facial recognition security feature fraudsters underground market criminal developer impersonation service deepfakes social medium account spam content bypass anti phishing control popular mail service scam campaign concern technology cyber security sector combat scam machine algorithm detect deepfakes mail suspicious activity spot unnatural facial movement discrepancy irregularity eye reflection tale sign deepfakes developer challenge cyber security false false negative arm race criminal unsustainable organisation law enforcement agency system criminal method fool detection system result resource intensive arm race system strait time,"[(0, 0.5950052), (10, 0.40003932)]",0

709855,Main,27,24/07/2024,Europol warns of uptick in  AI-aided child abuse images,,"The Hague: Artificial intelligence-linked images of child sex abuse are on the rise, Europe’s policing agency warned, saying the material makes it increasingly difficult to identify victims and perpetrators.
 Criminals have been adopting AI tools and services to carry out a range of crimes from online fraud and cyberattacks, to creating explicit images of children, Europol said.
 “Cases of AI-assisted and AI-generated child sexual abuse material have been reported,” the Hague-based agency said in a new report.
 “The use of AI which allows child sex offenders to generate or alter child sex abuse material is set to further proliferate in the near future,” Europol added in a 37-page report, looking at current online threats facing Europe.
 The production of artificial abuse images increases “the amount of illicit material in circulation and complicates the identification of victims as well as perpetrators,” Europol said.
 More than 300 million children a year were victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse, researchers at the University of Edinburgh said in May.
 Offences ranged from so-called sextortion, where predators demand money from victims to keep images private, to the abuse of AI technology to create deepfake videos and pictures. — AFP",hague artificial intelligence image sex abuse rise europe agency material difficult identify victim perpetrator criminal tool service range crime fraud cyberattacks explicit image child child sexual abuse material hague agency report child sex offender alter child sex material proliferate future report current online threat europe production artificial abuse image amount illicit material circulation identification victim perpetrator child victim sexual exploitation abuse researcher university edinburgh offence sextortion predator money victim private abuse technology create deepfake video picture,"[(10, 0.24476019), (13, 0.74352336)]",13
709107,StarBiz,2,22/07/2024,"Data analytics, AI tech  can beef up bank’s security",Adoption of measures crucial to curb online scams,"PETALING JAYA: Banks should leverage on data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to further enhance security, on top of existing measures. 
 Universiti Sains Malaysia associate professor Dr Selvakumar Manickam said while AI technology is still in its infancy, the adoption of AI and data analytics as well as joining hands with key players in the ecosystem will be crucial to curb online scams. 
 He added that while the measures taken by banks to combat online bank fraud are commendable, they are not foolproof or future-proof.
 “Cybercriminals will inevitably find ways to circumvent these measures, necessitating ongoing adaptation and improvement. 
 “To combat this persistent threat, collaboration among banks, telcos, social media platforms and government agencies is crucial,” he told StarBiz. 
 Additionally, telcos can play a more significant role by implementing stricter policies for phone number registration and holding owners accountable for numbers used in fraudulent activities, Selvakumar added.
 According to the Royal Malaysia Police, a total of 71,833 scams were reported from 2020 to May 2022, amounting to losses of more than RM5.2bil.
 In December 2022, Bank Negara announced five key measures to combat financial fraud, which include migrating from short messaging service (SMS) one-time passwords to a more secure authentication method, a transaction cooling-off period, a single designated device for authorisation, removal of hyperlinks from SMS and email communications, and a 24-hour cyber fraud security online. 
 In line with this, Malayan Banking Bhd said it will be implementing a 12-hour cooling-off period for transfer limit increase requests on its Maybank2U website, effective July 31. 
 Banks like CIMB Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd (Ambank) and Public Bank Bhd have also rolled out similar efforts. 
 Other measures that banks have also employed include the kill switch or lock account and mandatory SecureTAC measures. 
 CIMB  told StarBiz since the implementation of both the cooling-off period and mandatory SecureTAC measures in June 2023, the group has observed a significant reduction of up to 88% quarter-on-quarter in unauthorised ID registrations, demonstrating the effectiveness in preventing fraud.
 Selvakumar said while the cooling-off period is a positive step, this measure may cause inconvenience for users who need to make legitimate urgent transactions.
 On this note, CIMB said while users took some time to adapt to new security measures, the preventive measures have been well received, with customers recognising the importance of protecting their banking information.
 “Most recently, we have also introduced enhanced security measures to protect users from potential fraud associated with malware that exploits screen sharing and accessibility permissions,” it said. 
 Selvakumar said the effectiveness of measures like kill switch and account lock remains unclear, as the number of scams and frauds has not significantly decreased. 
 “This could be attributed to the fact that these measures still rely on user awareness and action, which may be lacking in some cases.”
 In this regard, Direct Lending founder Yik Seong Hui said education is still the most important aspect in curbing online frauds. 
 “The steps that banks have taken so far is definitely a good step forward. Nonetheless, the burden of combating scams does not solely lie with the bank. 
 “Users also need to manage their accounts responsibly. Hence, a lot of education is still required, particularly among the lower or middle-income groups,” he said
 Meanwhile, Ambank also noted one of the key areas it is focusing on to further strengthen security measures is customer education. 
 “We have ongoing programmes across all customer touchpoints, including informative content displayed in branches and online banking platforms. Additionally, regular reminders via prevalent fraud tactics are pushed through AmOnline App’s notifications to keep customers vigilant,” it told StarBiz.
 Ambank said the cooling-off period combined with its existing measures will create a robust defence system that safeguards their customers’ financial well-being. 
 “Our security measures are constantly reviewed and updated. This proactive approach ensures we stay ahead of emerging threats and adapt our defences accordingly.”",jaya bank data analytics artificial intelligence technology enhance security top measure universiti sains associate professor selvakumar manickam technology infancy adoption data analytics hand key player crucial curb online scam bank combat bank fraud commendable foolproof future proof cybercriminals circumvent measure adaptation improvement combat persistent threat collaboration bank social medium platform government agency crucial starbiz telco play role stricter policy phone registration owner accountable fraudulent activity royal malaysia police total scam amounting loss december bank negara key measure financial fraud short messaging service sm time password secure authentication method transaction period single device authorisation removal hyperlink email communication hour fraud security online malayan banking bhd hour period transfer limit increase request website effective july bank bank bhd ammb holding ambank public bank bhd effort measure bank kill lock account mandatory securetac measure starbiz implementation period mandatory securetac measure reduction quarter quarter unauthorised registration effectiveness fraud selvakumar period positive step measure inconvenience user urgent transaction cimb user time adapt security measure preventive measure customer banking enhanced security measure user potential fraud malware screen accessibility permission effectiveness measure account lock unclear scam attributed measure user awareness action regard direct lending founder yik seong hui education aspect online fraud step bank burden scam bank user account education lower middle income ambank key strengthen security measure customer education programme customer touchpoints informative content branch online banking platform regular reminder prevalent fraud tactic amonline app notification customer starbiz ambank period measure robust defence system customer financial security measure updated proactive approach stay threat adapt defence,"[(2, 0.9960938)]",2
709307,Lifestyle,4,22/07/2024,What’s next after AI beats the best?,"Lee Saedol, the top Go player, was defeated by AI AlphaGo in 2016, highlighting AI’s potential to surpass human expertise and its future role in society.","LEE Saedol was the finest Go player of his generation when he suffered a decisive loss, defeated not by a human opponent but by artificial intelligence (AI).
 Lee was beaten by AlphaGo, an AI computer program developed by Google’s DeepMind unit. The stunning upset, in 2016, made headlines around the world and looked like a clear sign that AI was entering a new, profoundly unsettling era.
 By besting Lee, an 18-time world champion revered for his intuitive and creative style of play, AlphaGo had solved one of computer science’s greatest challenges: teaching itself the abstract strategy needed to win at Go, widely considered the world’s most complex board game.
 “I am very surprised because I have never thought I would lose,” Lee said at the time in a post-match news conference. “I didn’t know that AlphaGo would play such a perfect Go.”
 But the implications of his loss went far beyond the game itself, in which two players compete for territory by placing black and white stones on a gridded board made up of 19 lines by 19 lines. 
 AlphaGo’s victory demonstrated the unbridled potential of AI to achieve superhuman mastery of skills once considered too complicated for machines.
 Lee, now 41, retired three years later, convinced that humans could no longer compete with computers at Go. 
 AI, he said, had changed the very nature of a game that originated in China more than 2,500 years ago.
 “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing,” he said in a recent interview.
 As society wrestles with what AI holds for humanity’s future, Lee is now urging others to avoid being caught unprepared, as he was, and to become familiar with the technology now. 
 He delivers lectures about AI, trying to give others the advance notice he wishes he had received before his match.
 “I faced the issues of AI early, but it will happen for others,” Lee said at a community education fair in Seoul to a crowd of students and parents. “It may not be a happy ending.”
 Since his loss, Lee has become an AI obsessive of sorts, following with rapt if uneasy attention as AI delivers one breakthrough after another.
 AI has helped chatbots carry on conversations almost indistinguishable from human interaction. 
 It has solved problems that have confounded scientists for decades, like predicting protein shapes. And it has blurred the lines of creativity: writing music, producing art and generating videos.
 Lee is not a doomsayer. In his view, AI may replace some jobs, but it may create some, too. When considering AI’s grasp of Go, he said it was important to remember that humans both created the game and designed the AI system that mastered it.What he worries about is that AI may change what humans value.
 “People used to be in awe of creativity, originality and innovation,” he said. “But since AI came, a lot of that has disappeared.”
 Lee started playing Go at the age of five under the guidance of his father, a schoolteacher and enthusiast of the game. 
 His family lived on Bigeumdo, an island off the southwest coast of the Korean Peninsula inhabited by around 3,600 people.
 His immense talent was apparent from the start. He quickly became the best player of his age, not only locally but across all of South Korea, Japan and China. He turned pro at 12.
 By the time he was 20, Lee had reached 9-dan, the highest level of mastery in Go. Soon, he was among the best players in the world, described by some as the Roger Federer of the game.
 “He was an idol, he was a star,” said Lee Hajin, a former professional Go player. “Everyone looked up to him.”
 As Lee Saedol’s standing was growing, Go started garnering interest from a new audience: computer scientists. Go posed a tantalising challenge for AI researchers. 
 The game is exponentially more complicated than chess, with it often being said that there are more possible positions on a Go board (10 with more than 100 zeros after it, by many mathematical estimates) than there are atoms in the universe.
 The breakthrough came from DeepMind, which built AlphaGo using so-called neural networks: mathematical systems that can learn skills by analysing enormous amounts of data. It started by feeding the network 30 million moves from high-level players. 
 Then the program played game after game against itself until it learned which moves were successful and developed new strategies.
 By late 2015, AlphaGo had defeated a three-time European Go champion five consecutive times in a closed-door match.
 Then, Lee was approached by Lee Hajin, who was working at the International Go Federation, with a proposal for a public match with a US$1mil (RM4.67mil) prize for beating AlphaGo.Lee Saedol said he accepted the offer without much thought, figuring it would be “fun”.
 “But fun with the presumption that I was going to win,” he said. “The possibility of losing didn’t occur to me.”
 The best-of-five match, played in Seoul, was a spectacle. In South Korea, where millions of people play Go and Lee is a celebrity, the showdown led nightly television broadcasts. More than 200 million people watched, with huge audiences in China and Japan.
 During the matches, a DeepMind engineer sat across from Lee and placed the stones as relayed to him by AlphaGo. Lee said not having a true human opponent was disconcerting. 
 AlphaGo played in a style he had never seen, and it felt odd to not try to decipher what his opponent was thinking and feeling. 
 The world watched in awe as AlphaGo pushed Lee into corners and made moves unthinkable for a human player.
 “I couldn’t get used to it,” he said. “I thought that AI would beat humans someday. I just didn’t think it was here yet.”
 AlphaGo won four of five matches. Lee Sang Hoon, his older brother and a professional Go player, remembered thinking: “This can’t be.”
 “It was shocking,” said his brother, who continues to play as a professional. Like other pros, he now trains with AI systems that continue to learn and improve.
 “Pro players are studying how these algorithms work and are trying to close the gap,” his brother said. “But we are a long way away.”
 AlphaGo’s victory “was a watershed moment in the history of AI,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s CEO, in a written statement. 
 It showed what computers that learn on their own from data “were really capable of”, he said.
 Lee had a hard time accepting the defeat. What he regarded as an art form, an extension of a player’s own personality and style, was now cast aside for an algorithm’s ruthless efficiency.
 “I could no longer enjoy the game,” he said. “So I retired.”
 Lee has kept one foot in the Go world. He has written several books, including an autobiography and a series about his famous matches. 
 He has created Go-inspired board games. He founded a Go academy for children with about a dozen branches across the country.
 But AI still dominates his thoughts, partly because of the ambivalence he feels about the pros and cons, but also because it’s a subject that hits close to home.
 His 17-year-old daughter is in her final year of high school. When they discuss what she should study at university, they often consider a future shaped by AI.

707955,Lifestyle,9,19/07/2024,Challenges of creativity and AI,,"BOOKS and movies of the future could all start to feel the same if creative industries embrace artificial intelligence to help write stories, a study published recently warned.
 The research, which drew on hundreds of volunteers and was published in Science Advances, comes amid rising fears over the impact of widely available AI tools that turn simple text prompts into relatively sophisticated music, art and writing.
 “Our goal was to study to what extent and how generative AI might help humans with creativity,” co-author Anil Doshi of the University College London told AFP.
 For their experiment, Doshi and co-author Oliver Hauser of the University of Exeter recruited around 300 volunteers as “writers.”
 These were people who didn’t write for a living, and their inherent creative ability was assessed by a standard psychology test that asked them to provide 10 drastically different words.
 The scientists then split them randomly into three groups to write an eight-sentence story about one of three topics: an adventure on the open seas, an adventure in the jungle, or an adventure on another planet.
 Participants were also randomly placed into three groups that received varying levels of AI assistance.
 The first group got no help, the second was provided a three-sentence story idea from ChatGPT, and the third could receive up to five AI-generated story ideas to help them get going.
 Individual benefit,  collective loss After completing their stories, participants were asked to assess their own work’s creativity through measures including  how novel it was, how enjoyable, and how much potential the  idea had to be turned into a  published book.
 An additional 600 external human reviewers also judged the story on the same measures.
 The authors found that, on average, AI boosted the quality of an individual writer’s creativity by up to 10 percent, and the story’s enjoyability by 22 percent, helping particularly with elements like structure and plot twists.
 These effects were most significant for writers who were judged during the initial task to be the least creative, “so it has this kind of leveling the playing field effect,” said Doshi.
 But on the collective level, they found AI-assisted stories looked much more similar to each other than those produced without any AI help, as writers “anchored” themselves too heavily to the suggested ideas.
 Hauser said this created a “social dilemma.” On the one hand, “you make it easier for people to get in; lowering barriers is good.” But if the collective novelty of art decreases, “it could be harmful down the line.”
 Doshi said the research also showed that, just like introducing pocket calculators to children too early could prevent them from learning how to do basic arithmetic, there was a danger that people could rely too much on AI tools before developing underlying skills in writing, music or more.
 People need to start thinking about “where in my workflow can I insert this tool to get the most benefit, while still inserting my own voice into the project or outcome.” – AFP",book movie creative industry artificial intelligence write story drew hundred volunteer science advance fear impact tool simple text prompt sophisticated music art goal study generative human creativity author anil doshi university college london afp experiment doshi author hauser university recruited volunteer writer people inherent creative ability standard psychology test scientist write sentence story topic sea adventure jungle adventure planet participant varying level assistance sentence story idea chatgpt story idea individual collective loss story participant ass creativity measure enjoyable potential idea book additional external human reviewer story measure author boosted quality individual writer creativity percent story enjoyability percent element structure plot twist effect writer initial task creative field doshi collective level story produced writer idea social dilemma hand easier people barrier novelty art harmful doshi pocket calculator child basic arithmetic danger people tool underlying skill music people workflow insert tool benefit inserting voice project outcome afp,"[(6, 0.9932348)]",6
707989,StarBiz,4,19/07/2024,"For stocks, is AI the Emperor’s new clothes?",,"THE shine may finally be coming off artificial intelligence (AI). 
 If so, the rotation out of Big Tech into small caps that has emerged recently could quickly accelerate. The question then is whether outperforming laggards hold up the broader market, or does the AI selloff drive benchmark indices into the red?
 Another round of upbeat results and outlooks from the second-quarter earnings season will reinvigorate the bull case for all things related to AI and microchips.
 But failure to meet elevated expectations leaves the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, which make up a third of the S&P 500’s market cap and are responsible for around two-thirds of the S&P 500’s entire gains this year, highly exposed.
 Throw in the potential escalation of US-China trade wars in a possible Trump presidency that will, on balance, benefit US-based small cap firms, and you get a glimpse of how this might play out.
 Last Friday the Magnificent Seven exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which includes semiconductor chip maker Nvidia, tumbled 4.4%, the biggest fall since its launch in April 2023. 
 The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks had its largest one-day risk-adjusted rally in history and its third-largest outperformance versus the Nasdaq, according to a Bank of America analysis.
 Since the release of surprisingly soft US inflation data on July 10, the Russell 2000 is up 10% and the ‘Mag Seven’ ETF and NYSE FANG index, which includes the Mag Seven stocks, are both down more than 5%. The S&P 500 is now in the red too.
 Like the Emperor’s new clothes, questions about whether AI really is all it is cracked up to be are now being asked.
 Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote an article in May titled Don’t Believe the AI Hype, a pithier follow-up to an extensive research paper he penned earlier that month titled The Simple Macroeconomics of AI.
 Acemoglu argues that the estimated “total factor productivity” impact over the next decade of AI technology, in its current guise at least, is a relatively tiny 0.53%. That’s a negligible 0.05% a year.
 His forecasts for around 0.5% and 1% increases in AI-generated productivity and gross domestic product growth, respectively, over the next 10 years are significantly lower than Goldman Sachs economists’ comparable estimates of around 9% and 6%.
 Plenty cost, little benefit
 Acemoglu’s thoughts and findings were included in a June 25 note from Goldman Sachs “Gen AI: Too much spend, too little benefit?” that dissected the pros and cons of AI.
 Jim Covello, head of global equity research at the investment bank, is far more sceptical than his colleagues on the economics team.
 Covello reckons investment in expanding AI infrastructure – on data centres, utilities, and applications, among other things – will exceed US$1 trillion in coming years. 
 The crucial question, in Covello’s view, is: what US$1 trillion problem will AI solve?
 “Replacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions I’ve witnessed in my 30 years of closely following the tech industry,” he says.
 Comparisons with the early days of the Internet are misplaced. Even in its infancy the Internet was a low-cost technology solution that enabled eCommerce to replace costly existing structures – quite literally – such as brick-and-mortar buildings.
 Covello gives the example of integrating GPS into smartphones. 
 The technology for this to be rolled out widely didn’t exist in the early 2000s but – no pun intended – the “roadmap” did. The roadmap on what other technologies could eventually deliver was also there right at the start.
 Is that the case today with AI? “Eighteen months after the introduction of generative AI to the world, not one truly transformative – let alone cost-effective – application has been found,” he argues.
 No game changer
 Covello’s is one of the few voices on Wall Street to call out the AI mania so bluntly. Bob Elliott, the CEO at Unlimited Funds and a former executive at Bridgewater, this week added his.
 Even in the most optimistic scenario, Elliott says the benefits to S&P 500 companies from rising AI-related spending and increased economy-wide productivity are “modest.”
 That scenario assumes a US$1.3 trillion rise in AI spending through 2032, all by S&P 500 companies, lifting revenue growth to around 6.5% from 4%. 
 Added together, he reckons this implies a roughly US$650bil increase in S&P 500 earnings by 2032 relative to today, or about a 25% increase in nominal terms.
 Even if you ignore the difficulty in forecasting earnings eight years out, that points to around a US$10 trillion, or 25%, increase, on the S&P 500’s current market cap.
 “It’s a pretty marginal impact, not one that is game changing (and) is already likely priced in, probably fully priced last year during the summer of the AI ‘boom,” Elliott posted on X this week.
 Investors may be slowly coming round to this view. 
 Bank of America’s July fund manager survey shows that 43% of respondents now think AI is in a bubble, up five percentage points from May, while 45% don’t think so, down from more than 50% in May.
 But nothing changes sentiment like price, and it will probably take a much bigger reversal in these overcrowded trades to convince investors that the AI well has run dry. — Reuters

707965,StarBiz,9,19/07/2024,TSMC raises revenue outlook on back of AI boom,,"Taipei: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) raised its projections for full-year revenue growth after results beat estimates, riding a global wave of spending on artificial intelligence (AI).
 The chipmaker for Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp now expects sales to grow more than the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously. 
 TSMC expects revenue of as much as US$23.2bil this quarter, above analysts’ projections. And it narrowed its forecast for capital spending – a key indicator of where TSMC sees future demand – to the high end of its original forecast, to US$30bil to US$32bil from as low as US$28bil previously.  
 The raised outlook conveys TSMC’s confidence in the longevity of an AI boom that began in late 2022 with the advent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. That spurred global tech giants from Microsoft Corp to Baidu Inc to splurge on AI infrastructure, largely powered by Nvidia accelerators. 
 Market expectations had risen in the weeks leading up to TSMC’s report. The wider smartphone market – another big driver for Taiwan’s largest company – is on a path to recovery. 
 Apple provided upbeat guidance to suppliers on shipments of its upcoming iPhone 16, based on the potential strength of its new AI services. That helped TSMC report a better-than-anticipated 36% rise in June-quarter profit.
 Net income rose to NT$247.8bil or about US$7.6bil, after the company disclosed its second-quarter sales grew at the fastest pace since 2022.
 Shares of the world’s largest maker of advanced chips have more than doubled since the AI boom took off in late 2022, and hit a series of all-time highs as the firm’s market capitalisation briefly crossed the US$1 trillion mark.
 Still, investor euphoria over TSMC’s prospects diminished Wednesday after Bloomberg Businessweek published comments by US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who said he’s at best lukewarm about defending Taiwan in the event of Chinese aggression. 
 On top of that, the United States is also mulling stricter chip curbs on China, Bloomberg News reported, triggering a global tech stock selloff as investors pondered the fallout for the world’s largest semiconductor arena.
 Caution about AI is now emerging in corners of the market. This month, Goldman Sachs warned that the biggest US tech firms may be spending too much on AI.
 Before the results, SemiAnalysis’s Chaolien Tseng had warned that TSMC’s stock may take a hit if it didn’t lift its 2024 revenue growth to at least 25%. — Bloomberg",taipei taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsmc projection revenue growth estimate global wave spending artificial intelligence chipmaker apple nvidia corp sale maximum mid tsmc revenue bil quarter analyst projection forecast capital spending key indicator tsmc future demand original forecast bil low bil outlook conveys confidence longevity boom late advent openai chatgpt global tech giant corp baidu splurge infrastructure nvidia accelerator market expectation week tsmc report smartphone market driver largest company path recovery apple upbeat guidance supplier shipment iphone potential strength service report rise june quarter profit net income bil bil company quarter sale fastest pace share largest maker chip boom late hit series time high firm market capitalisation mark investor euphoria tsmc prospect wednesday bloomberg businessweek comment republican presidential nominee donald trump lukewarm taiwan event chinese aggression top stricter chip curb china bloomberg news global tech stock selloff investor largest semiconductor arena caution corner market month goldman sachs biggest tech firm semianalysis chaolien tseng tsmc stock lift revenue growth bloomberg,"[(2, 0.22585756), (9, 0.17217085), (12, 0.5965268)]",12
707967,StarBiz,9,19/07/2024,Samsung Electronics  buys British  AI tech startup,,"Seoul: Samsung Electronics has bought a British startup that develops advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the South Korean tech giant says, as demand for its high-end chips used in AI hardware surges.
 Oxford Semantic Technologies specialises in knowledge graph technology – a more advanced way of storing complex information in a web – Samsung said in a statement yesterday.
 It added that it expected to use the technology “not only in mobile devices but also in a wide range of products, including TVs and home appliances, in the future”.
 Samsung did not disclose the value of the deal.
 From generative capabilities such as writing texts from brief instructions to simultaneous translation of phone conversations, tech titans are in a frantic race to more fully deploy AI technology in smartphones and other consumer products.
 The purchase of Oxford Semantic marks the latest move by Samsung to strengthen its AI offerings.
 Samsung Electronics is the world’s biggest producer of memory chips, including versions used in top-of-the-line AI hardware from industry leaders.
 The firm is also one of the world’s biggest smartphone makers, and the latest models it unveiled in January are powered by its own Galaxy AI tech.
 Samsung last week showcased new deployments of AI across a range of its consumer electronic products, from wireless headphones to smartwatches and health and fitness tracking rings.
 It also unveiled the latest generation of its AI-packed folding phones.

706975,Main,7,16/07/2024,Fahmi: Beware of AI-generated deepfakes,,"PUTRAJAYA: Members of the public should be wary of scam tactics involving the dissemination of fake videos and images or deepfakes created through artificial intelligence (AI), says Fahmi Fadzil.
 The Communications Minister said that while the use of AI helps the country’s development, some parties are misusing the technology.
 “Datuk Seri Siti Nurhaliza in an Instagram post several days ago showed a WhatsApp video call that seemed as if she was talking, when it is actually a live deepfake.
 “AI can be used for good and evil. We need to be cautious of the information received and ensure any video received is genuine or produced through an AI application,” he said at the ministry’s monthly assembly here yesterday, Bernama reported. 
 As such, Fahmi called on the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) and Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) to publicise and educate the public on the dangers of scam tactics using AI deepfakes.
 On Sunday, the country’s top singer revealed the latest tactic by scammers believed to be using AI technology to imitate her voice and face for profit.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi will meet with representatives of all social media platforms in Singapore later this month to discuss several matters, including the dangers of AI on their platforms.
 “I hope the issue of AI-generated deepfakes can be addressed by Meta as WhatsApp is under Meta’s responsibility,” he said.
 He also suggested that all ministries utilise the benefits of AI in their tasks and requested the Tun Abdul Razak Broad­casting and Information Institute (IPPTAR) to coordinate courses on the technology.
 “AI can help not only in creating content but also in several other aspects, such as coding, programming, data analysis and other areas where AI can be beneficial,” he said.

 Victims are lured with the promise of a video call from the singer, which turns out to be an AI-generated simulation displaying her face and voice.
 Subsequently, victims are tricked into parting with their money for fictitious rewards, reported Harian Metro.
 Siti Nurhaliza took to her social media on Sunday to expose these fraudulent activities, sharing a video of these fabricated calls.
 “Fake. Do not believe the scammers. They are using my name and picture, and even an AI voice to convince people.
 “They also took my live videos with the intent to entrap and deceive people,” she said.
 She urged the public to raise awareness about these scams, emphasising: “I have never ­organised any contests or offered cash rewards to anyone.
 “Do not be deceived when receiving these messages and video calls,”
 According to Siti Nurhaliza, numerous fraudsters have exploited her identity and image, often targeting the elderly.

706623,Lifestyle,4,15/07/2024,AI’senergy appetite,"AI’s growing demand for energy  is driving up emissions, challenging tech giants’ sustainability goals.","WHEN Google announced recently that its climate emissions had risen by 48% since 2019, it pointed the finger at artificial intelligence (AI).
 US tech firms are building vast networks of data centres across the globe and say AI is fuelling the growth, throwing the spotlight on the amount of energy the technology is sucking up and its impact on the environment.
 How does AI use electricity? Every time a user punches a request into a chatbot or generative AI tool, the request is fired off to a data centre.
 Even before that stage, developing AI programs known as large language models (LLMs) needs a huge amount of computer power.
 All the while, the computers are burning through electricity, and the servers get hotter, meaning more electricity to cool them.
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report earlier this year that data centres in general used roughly 40% of electricity for computing and 40% for cooling.
 Why are experts worried? Big tech firms have been rushing to pack all their products with AI ever since OpenAI launched its ChatGPT bot in late 2022.
 Plenty of experts are concerned that these new products will cause electricity usage to spike.
 This is firstly because AI services require more power than their non-AI analogues.
 For example, various studies have shown that each request made to ChatGPT uses roughly 10 times the power of a single Google search.
 So if Google switches all search queries to AI – about nine billion a year – it could hugely inflate the company’s electricity usage.
 And most of these new services and products rely on LLMs.
 Programming these algorithms is extremely intensive and usually requires high-powered computer chips.
 They in turn require more cooling, which uses more electricity.
 How much energy does AI use? Before the era of AI, estimates generally suggested data centres accounted for around 1% of global electricity demand.
 The IEA report said data centres, cryptocurrencies and AI combined used 460TWh of electricity worldwide in 2022, or almost 2% of total global electricity demand.
 The IEA estimated that the figure could double by 2026 – the equivalent of Japan’s usage figures.
 Alex De Vries, a researcher who runs the Digiconomist website, modelled the electricity used by AI alone by focusing on sales projections from the US firm Nvidia, which has cornered the market in AI-  specialised servers.
 He concluded in a paper late last year that if Nvidia’s projected sales for 2023 were correct and all those servers ran at full power, they alone could be responsible for between 85.4TWh to 134.0TWh of annual electricity consumption – an amount similar to Argentina or Sweden.
 “The numbers I put in that article were already conservative to begin with because I couldn’t include things like cooling requirements,” he said.
 And he added that adoption of Nvidia’s servers had outstripped last year’s projections, so the figures would certainly be higher.
 How are data centres coping? Fabrice Coquio of Digital Realty, a data centre company that leases its services to others, said during a visit to one of its enormous facilities north of Paris in April that AI was going to transform his industry.
 “It’s going to be exactly the same (as the cloud), maybe a bit more massive in terms of the deployment,” he said.
 Part of Digital Realty’s latest data centre hub in Courneuve – a gigantic edifice that looks like a football stadium – will be dedicated to AI.
 Coquio explained that typical computing requests could be handled by server racks in rooms with powerful air-conditioning systems
 But AI racks use much more powerful components, get much hotter and require water to be physically pumped into the equipment, he said.
 “For sure, this requires different servers, storage equipment, communication equipment,” Coquio said.
 Is it sustainable? The biggest players in AI and data centres – Amazon, Google and Microsoft – have been trying to reduce their carbon footprints by buying up vast amounts of renewable energy.
 Amazon official Prasad Kalyanaraman said the firm’s data centre division, AWS, was “the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world today”.
 AWS is committed to being a net-zero carbon company by 2040. Google and Microsoft have pledged to reach that goal by 2030.
 But building new data centres and ramping up usage in existing ones is not going to help with green energy targets.
 Both Google and Microsoft have said in recent reports that their greenhouse gas emissions have been rising in the last few years.
 Google flagged a 48% rise from 2019 and Microsoft a 30% increase from 2020.
 Both have squarely blamed AI.
 Microsoft President Brad Smith told Bloomberg in May that the pledge was a “moonshot” made before the AI “explosion”, adding that “the Moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020”. – AFP",google climate emission finger artificial intelligence tech firm vast network data centre fuelling growth spotlight amount energy technology impact environment electricity time user punch chatbot generative tool request data centre stage program language model huge amount computer power computer electricity server electricity international energy agency iea report data centre electricity expert tech firm pack product chatgpt bot late plenty expert product electricity usage spike service power analogue study chatgpt time power single google search google switch query inflate company electricity usage service product algorithm intensive computer chip electricity energy era estimate data centre global electricity demand iea report data centre cryptocurrencies twh electricity total global electricity demand iea figure double equivalent japan usage figure vries run digiconomist website electricity sale projection firm market server paper late nvidia sale server power responsible twh twh annual electricity consumption amount sweden article conservative cooling requirement nvidia server projection figure data centre fabrice coquio digital realty data company lease service enormous facility april transform industry cloud massive term deployment digital realty data centre hub courneuve gigantic edifice football stadium coquio typical computing request rack powerful air system rack powerful component hotter water equipment server storage equipment communication equipment coquio sustainable biggest player data centre google microsoft carbon footprint vast amount renewable energy amazon official prasad kalyanaraman firm data centre division largest purchaser renewable energy aws committed net carbon company google reach goal building data centre usage green energy target microsoft report greenhouse gas emission google rise microsoft increase microsoft president brad smith bloomberg pledge moonshot explosion moon time,"[(13, 0.9961257)]",13
706699,StarBiz,4,15/07/2024,Forging the AI destiny:  TiPM’s holistic approach,,"IN a world where artificial intelligence (AI) continues to redefine industries and economies powerfully, Technology Innovation Park Malaysia (TiPM) stands at the forefront of driving innovation and empowering the nation’s AI future through critical initiatives and a holistic approach.
 To strategically align with Malaysia’s aspiration of becoming a regional AI hub, TiPM aims to fortify the country’s position in the global AI landscape by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic advancement through AI technologies, which also underscores TiPM’s continuous commitment to driving sustainable growth and competitiveness in the digital era.
 TiPM’s vision for national AI development rests on the following essential building blocks:
 > AI 	talent cultivation: TiPM leverages the National Technology Innovation Sandbox programme and collaborates with Nvidia to offer AI-focused upskilling and reskilling programs through the AI sandbox pilot programme. 
 The aim is to empower the local workforce with essential AI knowledge, fostering over 13,000 new AI 	talents by 2026. This aligns seamlessly with Malaysia’s National AI Roadmap 2021-2025, emphasising the 	development of a robust talent pool.
 > Startup Nurturing: TiPM’s AI Sandbox Pilot Programme also aims to nurture AI startups – a remarkable 900 of them by 2026. This ambitious target, tenfold the national goal of incubating 100 AI companies to generate RM1bil in revenue by 2030, underscores this project’s immense scale and potential.
 > Strengthening national AI infrastructure and innovation ecosystem: TiPM’s AI Park, Malaysia’s first, is a vibrant hub for integrating diverse technologies. As a centre of excellence, it bolsters innovation ecosystems in drones, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, supporting innovators, researchers, and companies in refining solutions within a controlled environment.
 > Global competitiveness: Our strategic partnership with Nvidia vividly demonstrates TiPM’s unwavering commitment to equipping Malaysia’s workforce for the dynamic global AI landscape. By bridging the divide between current practices and global industry standards, we empower our talent pool to stay competitive and thrive.
 In other words, TiPM takes a holistic approach, acting as a bridge between AI research and industry implementation by fostering collaboration, talent development and low-cost but high-impact practical solutions, helping industry players to integrate AI into their operations through the following:
 > Providing a platform for companies to experiment with AI technologies, develop prototypes and explore practical applications;

 > Conducting awareness campaigns, seminars, and conferences to educate industry stakeholders about AI’s benefits – by demystifying AI and showcasing successful case studies, we encourage adoption.
 TiPM also tailors its support to specific industries.
 AI transformation is across industries and some sectors have emerged as frontrunners in embracing this technology, such as information technology (IT); professional, scientific, and technical services; finance and insurance, and manufacturing, as can be seen from “The AI Index 2024”, annual report by Standford University.
 However, other key sectors poised to benefit massively from AI include agriculture, healthcare, and hospitality. These sectors also play a pivotal role in maintaining Malaysia’s competitive edge within the region’s economy.
 Malaysia’s agriculture sector requires revolutionary operational innovation, and AI can play a key role in this. 
 Additionally, healthcare exhibits significant potential, with approximately 22% of projects focused on adoption within this industry – making it a prominent player among Malaysia’s sectors.
 Meanwhile, despite making significant strides in integrating AI into our digital transformation recently, Malaysia is still catching up with its regional peers.
 China, for instance, has seen remarkable success due to its massive scale and extensive proof-of-concept trials that generate vast amounts of data for AI development.
 According to “The AI Index 2024”, the United States still leads China, the European Union (EU), and the UK as the source of top AI models. 
 In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from US-based institutions, far outpacing the EU’s 21 and China’s 15.
 However, according to the same report, China far outpaces other nations in AI patents. 
 In 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the United States, which accounted for only 20.9% of AI patent origins. 
 These might be the early signs that the centre of technology innovation leadership and power is indeed shifting to East Asia and the Pacific.
 Singapore also demonstrates impressive AI readiness across different dimensions.
 For example, in the Government AI Readiness Index 2023 by Oxford Insights, Singapore emerged as the global leader in government AI readiness, while according to the Asia- Pacific (Apac) AI Readiness Index 2023 by Salesforce, Singapore leads the Apac region with a score of 70.1, followed by Japan (59.8) and China (59.7). Malaysia (48.2) comes eighth in the region.
 Notably, according to the later report, except for Singapore, all South-East Asian countries –Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam –achieved scores below the Apac average in their overall AI readiness. However, these nations have only recently introduced national AI policies and strategies (between 2021 and 2022) –Malaysia in 2021. 
 Thus, we may soon witness the practical impact of these AI initiatives on businesses and government organisations.
 Positive signs
 However, there are very positive signs that Malaysia’s AI ecosystem might be just heating up, and Malaysia is progressing well in integrating AI and positioning itself as an AI hub in the region.
 For example, according to the aforementioned Government AI Readiness Index 2023, Malaysia has been reported as a notable exception – a non-high-income country punching above its weight. Malaysia’s overall score is 68.71, which is much higher than the average score of 43.69 for upper middle-income countries, and it is ranked 23rd globally (an improvement from 29th in the 2022 index) and sixth in East Asia after such well-known AI-leading nations like Singapore, South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. 
 These rankings consider factors such as AI vision, policy, technology integration and data accessibility.
 According to Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 2023, Malaysia is positioned higher than Taiwan in terms of the estimated impact of AI adoption on annual productivity growth over 10 years, just below the global average.
 Based on the Ipsos survey, 69% of Malaysian respondents view AI products and services as more beneficial than harmful, lower than Indonesia (78%) and Thailand (74%) but significantly higher than many Western countries, as highlighted in Standford’s AI Index Report 2024.
 AI potential
 Additionally, apart from Nvidia, other major global tech players are showing interest in Malaysia’s AI potential, and Microsoft’s recent investment of US$2.2bil to support the country’s digital transformation is a significant milestone.
 The government has also announced a partnership with Google to train individuals in AI and data analytics at no cost, and the company is considering the creation of a Google data centre in Malaysia.
 According to a study by IBM’s institute for business value, nearly a third of surveyed companies in Malaysia have already integrated generative AI, and over 40% of information and communications technology professionals report that their organisations are actively exploring the use of generative AI to drive business growth.
 Malaysia does face challenges such as data privacy concerns, lack of skilled talent, and slow regulatory adaptation. 
 Addressing these hurdles will be crucial for sustained AI growth.Therefore, as our nation continues to navigate towards a future where AI transcends being just a technology to become a transformative force for progress, it is imperative that we steadfastly support and advocate for initiatives that propel Malaysia to the forefront of the global AI landscape. 
 By uniting in our efforts, we can leverage the potent combination of innovation, entrepreneurship, and talent development to pave the way for a brighter and more prosperous future for all Malaysians.

706695,StarBiz,11,15/07/2024,OpenAI working on new reasoning technology,Approach to deliver advanced capabilities to ChatGPT,"San Francisco: ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working on a novel approach to its artificial intelligence (AI) models in a project code-named “Strawberry”, according to a person familiar with the matter and internal documentation reviewed by Reuters.
 The project, details of which have not been previously reported, comes as the Microsoft-backed startup races to show that the types of models it offers are capable of delivering advanced reasoning capabilities.
 Teams inside OpenAI are working on Strawberry, according to a copy of a recent internal OpenAI document seen by Reuters in May. Reuters could not ascertain the precise date of the document, which details a plan for how OpenAI intends to use Strawberry to perform research. 
 The source described the plan as a work in progress. The news agency could not establish how close Strawberry is to being publicly available.
 How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said.
 The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company’s AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms “deep research”, according to the source.
 This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers.
 Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: “We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. 
 Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time.”
 The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry.
 The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough.
 Two sources described viewing earlier this year what OpenAI staffers told them were Q* demos, capable of answering tricky science and maths questions out of reach of today’s commercially-available models.
 Last Tuesday at an internal all-hands meeting, OpenAI showed a demo of a research project that it claimed had new human-like reasoning skills, according to Bloomberg. 
 An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the meeting but declined to give details of the contents. Reuters could not determine if the project demonstrated was Strawberry.
 OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models’ reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialised way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets.
 Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence.
 While large language models (LLMs) can already summarise dense texts and compose elegant prose far more quickly than any human, the technology often falls short on common–sense problems whose solutions seem intuitive to people, like recognising logical fallacies and playing tic-tac-toe. 
 When the model encounters these kinds of problems, it often “hallucinates” bogus information.
 AI researchers interviewed by Reuters generally agree that reasoning, in the context of AI, involves the formation of a model that enables AI to plan ahead, reflect how the physical world functions, and work through challenging multi-step problems reliably.
 Improving reasoning in AI models is seen as the key to unlocking the ability for the models to do everything from making major scientific discoveries to planning and building new software applications. 
 OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said earlier this year that in AI “the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability”.
 Other companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft are likewise experimenting with different techniques to improve reasoning in AI models, as are most academic labs that perform AI research. 
 Researchers differ, however, on whether LLMs are capable of incorporating ideas and long-term planning into how they do prediction. For instance, one of the pioneers of modern AI, Yann LeCun, who works at Meta, has frequently said that LLMs are not capable of human-like reasoning.
 Strawberry is a key component of OpenAI’s plan to overcome those challenges, the source familiar with the matter said. The document seen by Reuters described what Strawberry aims to enable, but not how.
 In recent months, the company has privately been signalling to developers and other outside parties that it is on the cusp of releasing technology with significantly more advanced reasoning capabilities, according to four people who have heard the company’s pitches. 
 They declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak about private matters.
 Strawberry includes a specialised way of what is known as “post-training” OpenAI’s generative AI models, or adapting the base models to hone their performance in specific ways after they have already been “trained” on reams of generalised data, one of the sources said.
 The post-training phase of developing a model involves methods like “fine-tuning”, a process used on nearly all language models today that comes in many flavours, such as having humans give feedback to the model based on its responses and feeding it examples of good and bad answers.
 Strawberry has similarities to a method developed at Stanford in 2022 called “Self-Taught Reasoner” or “STaR”, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
 STaR enables AI models to “bootstrap” themselves into higher intelligence levels via iteratively creating their own training data, and in theory could be used to get language models to transcend human-level intelligence, one of its creators, Stanford professor Noah Goodman, told Reuters.
 “I think that is both exciting and terrifying if things keep going in that direction we have some serious things to think about as humans,” Goodman said. Goodman is not affiliated with OpenAI and is not familiar with Strawberry.
 Among the capabilities OpenAI is aiming Strawberry at is performing long-horizon tasks, the document says, referring to complex tasks that require a model to plan ahead and perform a series of actions over an extended period of time, the first source explained.
 To do so, OpenAI is creating, training and evaluating the models on what the company calls a “deep-research” dataset, according to the OpenAI internal documentation. 
 Reuters was unable to determine what is in that dataset or how long an extended period would mean.
 OpenAI specifically wants its models to use these capabilities to conduct research by browsing the web autonomously with the assistance of a “CUA”, or a computer-using agent, that can take actions based on its findings, according to the document and one of the sources. OpenAI also plans to test its capabilities on doing the work of software and machine-learning engineers. — Reuters",san francisco chatgpt maker approach artificial intelligence model code strawberry person familiar matter internal documentation reuters project detail microsoft startup race type model offer capable advanced capability team openai internal openai document reuters reuters precise document detail openai strawberry source plan news agency strawberry secret person document describes project strawberry model company generate answer query navigate internet openai term source model interview dozen researcher detail story openai company spokesperson statement model continuous capability common practice industry belief system time spokesperson address question strawberry project reuters inside company breakthrough source openai staffer demo capable tricky science math question model internal hand openai demo project human skill bloomberg openai spokesperson meeting detail content reuters project strawberry openai innovation model capability person familiar strawberry involves model pre datasets researcher reuters key human super human level intelligence language model summarise dense text compose elegant prose human technology short common sense solution people logical fallacy tic tac toe model encounter hallucinates researcher reuters context formation model plan reflect physical function multi step model key unlocking ability model major scientific discovery building software application chief executive officer altman progress ability company meta microsoft likewise technique model academic lab perform researcher capable idea term planning prediction instance pioneer modern yann lecun meta capable human strawberry key component openai plan challenge source familiar matter document reuters aim enable month company developer party technology capability people company pitch authorised speak private matter specialised post training openai generative model base model performance specific ream data source phase model method fine process language model human model response example bad answer similarity stanford taught reasoner star source matter star model intelligence level data theory language model human level intelligence creator professor noah goodman reuters direction human goodman goodman openai familiar strawberry capability strawberry horizon task document complex task model plan perform series action period time source model company deep dataset internal documentation reuters unable determine dataset period openai model capability web cua computer agent action finding document source plan capability software machine engineer reuters,"[(5, 0.9970734)]",5
705513,StarBiz,2,12/07/2024,Questions to ask                  when companies use AI,Expert: Aim for full optimisation and goals to achieve,"KUALA LUMPUR: Businesses across all sectors need to use artificial intelligence (AI) with clarity rather than dive into it for fear of losing out, says Kyndryl managing director Malaysia and Indonesia Effendi Azmi Hashim.
 As an information technology (IT) infrastructure services provider, Effendi said some people in management that he had spoken to, were unsure of why their companies are beginning to use AI or how to use it responsibly.
 “When I say clarity, I mean knowing why you are using it, and what is the goal or outcome you want to see. 
 “The problem with AI is most people will try to use it for everything,” he told StarBiz on the sidelines of the “Third Malaysian banking conference 2024: Banking in the era of GenAI reshaping banking, innovating for the new economy and accelerating sustainability,” here yesterday.
 According to Effendi, once a budget has been allocated for AI, it was wise to aim for full optimisation of what can be achieved, namely the process, function and industry.
 “If you are going to do it for the process, then what is the time frame you would like to see things change?  
 “If you are doing it for function, how can AI make the workforce more productive? These are questions to ask,” he said.
 He added some businesses are already halfway into their AI journey, only to make a pit stop and question why they started in the first place.
 “A question I get asked a lot is, what is AI? I’m not being asked that as a test, but rather to give them an assurance that it is relevant and what can be achieved from it. 
 “When businesses and organisations have strong and solid plans for their AI journey, then they are more likely to be responsible when using AI and have strong governance backing it,” Effendi noted.
 Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers chief executive Edward Ling said the use of AI in the banking sector is not new.
 It was no longer the matter of adopting AI, but realising its full potential and how it can be of assistance, he said.
 There are two aspects of productivity which had been estimated to increase by 30% from the use of AI.
 “First, there’s speed, which determines how more efficient an organisation can become. But then we also need to focus more on the value creation of it. For instance, if we’re talking about sales and marketing, how can AI personalise customer service or create better products?”
 Meanwhile, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) group technology, data and digital, human capital director Dr Shameem Farouk said the bank began its AI journey in 2018.
 Her role was to upskill and reskill employees so they would be ready for AI.
 “I organised a programme for them to learn about AI and at a strategic level, how AI can contribute value to our customers and shareholders. 
 “Our top management took the time to also learn programming, because for them, they see the future as the bank being enabled by technology,” she said.She added the competition was no longer just among banks, but technology companies that were venturing into banking.
 “Maybank looked at our talent and said they must be of high technology capability people. If the senior management and top management are to lead a tech workforce, then we ourselves need to be equipped to know how to do it,” Shameem noted.
 On the question of where Malaysia’s banking sector and its adoption of AI stands among the other countries in the region, Ling said the sector is not too far behind its peers.
 “When we went overseas and exchanged experiences, we found that we are really not that far behind, or we are at par. So it all depends on individual banks, how fast you are picking yourself up,” he said.
 Ling explained that bigger banks that have more funding might invest more, leading them to have stronger advancements in the industry.
 Smaller banks, he noted, could face some difficulties in terms of guidance.

705545,StarBiz,10,12/07/2024,Power-guzzling AI                             to drive ESG debt sales,Global demand for energy-intensive data centres rising,"NEW YORK: The global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy is driving demand for energy-intensive data centres, which could end up being a factor that boosts sales of green debt in the United States, according to Morgan Stanley. 
 Sales of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-linked bonds in the United States have plunged over the last few years as Republicans push back on ESG investing and investors fret over greenwashing concerns.
 But data centres’ growing electricity needs to sustain the AI boom could fuel demand for more energy, including from renewable resources. 
 That’s likely to bolster sales of green debt, said Melissa James, vice-chairman of global capital markets at Morgan Stanley.
 Even with slowness in the United States, as of June, green debt issuance globally is running at the fastest pace since the market’s inception in 2007. 
 By the end of 2024, Morgan Stanley expects sales to soar to the trillion-dollar mark seen in 2021.  
 “We’re on pace to actually meet or maybe even exceed slightly that record issuance level,” said James.
 James spoke with Bloomberg News in a series of interviews ending on July 10. 
 Below are highlights of the conversation, condensed and edited for clarity.
 What’s fuelling the record issuance we’ve seen in the global sustainable bond market?Climate is perceived to be the single biggest existential threat of our time. 
 Issuers are focusing more narrowly on their climate and transition objectives, particularly as we start to approach the 2030 deadline that a lot of clients have set interim emission reduction targets by.
 The year 2021 was the high water mark for ESG-labelled issuance, with just over a trillion dollars. 
 Theoretically, we’re on pace to actually meet or maybe even exceed slightly that record issuance level.
 Companies, especially in the United States, aren’t selling a lot of labelled bonds. Is that going to change any time soon?Corporate issuance has been relatively flat over the last several years. With the maturation of the market, some of the issuers who had their one or two projects to fund have funded those projects, and so, they’re not going to be repeat issuers necessarily every year. 
 They may come back in two or three years, or during their next capital expenditure cycle. 
 So, there’s a certain percentage of the market that I think falls in that category where they’re sort of one-and-done for the time being.
 There are the other perennial issuers who will be repeat issuers with some degree of periodicity. But those will be smaller relative to the overall size of the market. 
 So, what’s going to drive corporate issuance in the United States?For companies that have the opportunity to invest in projects where the economics make sense, where the return on investment is justifiable and where they can decarbonise, those companies will do that all day long. 
 We’ve seen a number of issuers in some of the hard-to-abate sectors like basic materials – chemicals in particular – come to market and in some instances, they will finance those with green-labelled issuances. The second driver, in our judgment, is the tremendous demand for power as a consequence of the AI boom. 
 This phenomenon is putting increased demand on the need for additional power sources, renewable or otherwise, including alternative power sources. 
 Some of these data centres, if they’re operated at a certain threshold in terms of their energy efficiency, they themselves actually qualify for ESG-labelled or green-labelled transactions. We think that that has the potential to also help fuel activity.What about green convertible bonds?We did a lot of convertibles for companies last year that were kind of in the energy transition space. 
 You tend to see higher-growth companies that are still evolving, or earlier in their life cycle from a cash flow perspective, accessing the convertible market to take advantage of the fact that they have equity that’s perceived to have a lot of upside. And they can use that perceived upside as a way to lower their interest coupon today. These transactions are also typically issued in the 144A market and that can be an advantage to some borrowers as well.
 What do you think might drive issuance outside the United States? Latin America has been very active, for instance. The Latin America region has been an emerging growth area of ESG-labelled issuance due to its unique geographic characteristics and proximity to extensive natural resources. For example, Brazil has the potential to be the world’s lowest cost producer of green hydrogen due to its abundance of water. 
 The climate crisis and geopolitical conflict has also advanced a need to rethink and relocate supply chains. 
 Nearshoring or “friend-shoring” presents an opportunity for Mexico and others in the region, as global supply chains become more difficult to secure. —Bloomberg",york global artificial intelligence frenzy demand energy intensive data centre boost sale green debt morgan stanley sale environmental social governance esg bond united republican push investor fret concern data centre electricity sustain boom fuel demand energy renewable resource bolster sale green debt melissa james vice chairman global capital market stanley slowness june green debt issuance fastest pace market inception stanley sale dollar mark pace meet record issuance level james bloomberg news series interview highlight conversation edited clarity fuelling record issuance global sustainable bond market climate single biggest existential threat time issuer climate transition objective approach deadline lot client interim emission reduction target water mark esg issuance dollar pace meet record issuance level company lot bond change time corporate issuance flat maturation market issuer project project repeat issuer expenditure cycle percentage market category sort time perennial issuer issuer periodicity relative size market drive corporate issuance united company opportunity project sense return investment justifiable decarbonise company day issuer hard abate sector basic material chemical market instance finance green issuance tremendous demand power consequence boom phenomenon increased demand additional power source renewable alternative power source data centre threshold term energy efficiency esg green labelled transaction potential fuel activity green convertible bond convertible company energy transition space growth company life cycle cash flow perspective convertible market advantage equity lot upside lower coupon transaction market advantage borrower issuance united latin america active instance latin america region growth issuance unique geographic characteristic proximity natural resource potential lowest cost producer green hydrogen abundance water climate crisis geopolitical conflict rethink relocate supply chain friend opportunity mexico region global supply chain difficult secure bloomberg,"[(8, 0.6232726), (13, 0.13422744), (14, 0.23940933)]",8
705547,StarBiz,15,12/07/2024,Microsoft ditches OpenAI observer seat,Firm is trying to stave off antitrust scrutiny,"BRUSSELS: Microsoft has given up its board observer seat at OpenAI in a move aimed at easing US and UK antitrust regulators’ concerns about the extent of its control over the artificial intelligence (AI) startup amid the soaring popularity of generative AI. 
 But the change was unlikely to resolve concerns by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a source at the agency said.
 The FTC is conducting an antitrust review of deals by Big Tech firms and top AI companies.
 The move shows Microsoft sees significant potential antitrust exposure and is trying to get ahead of it, the FTC source said.
 A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
 Meanwhile, Apple, which said last month it was bringing OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, to its devices, will not take an observer role on OpenAI’s board after being widely expected to do so, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
 The person added that OpenAI has no future plans to offer any board observer roles. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
 An OpenAI spokesperson said the company would establish a new approach to engaging with stakeholders by hosting regular meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. 
 Microsoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI’s board in November after OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.
 The seat meant Microsoft could attend OpenAI’s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.
 The observer seat and Microsoft’s more than US$10bil investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in the European Union, Britain and the United States over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.
 The position provided insights into the board’s work without compromising its independence, Microsoft said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.
 It cited OpenAI’s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman’s return to the startup as reasons for giving up its observer seat.
 “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction. 
 “Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,” it said in the letter.  — Reuters",brussels board openai move antitrust regulator concern control artificial intelligence startup popularity generative change resolve concern federal trade commission source agency antitrust review deal tech firm top company potential antitrust exposure ftc source spokesperson microsoft reply request comment apple month openai chatbot chatgpt device role board person direct knowledge matter person future plan board observer apple respond request comment spokesperson company approach stakeholder regular meeting strategic partner apple investor thrive capital khosla venture position board november chief executive officer altman rein company seat microsoft attend openai board meeting access confidential voting right matter director microsoft bil investment openai unease antitrust watchdog european union britain control openai position insight board independence microsoft letter openai openai partnership innovation customer base altman return startup reason month progress board confident company direction role letter reuters,"[(9, 0.75631934), (14, 0.23690654)]",9
703371,Main,14,06/07/2024,Aiming high in the face of AI,Journalists have embraced it as a ‘co-worker’ but with real people serving as gatekeepers to ensure the truth and the human touch.,"THE media, like many other industries, has had to face a series of hurdles in the last decade. But the last few years have been the hardest.The advent of digitalisation and the rise in popularity of social media have changed how people consume news; these are challenges that have been the most deadly.
 The media has had to quickly adjust itself to changing trends and pivot – meaning, we changed the way we tell our stories, both in terms of platform and content.
 Just when we thought we had overcome them, there is a bigger quake set to shake our world to its very core: Artificial Intelligence.Before the world population fully took in the magnet that was social media, AI crept in, an invisible being that reads your habits and pushes to you the news and stories you care about the most.
 It is customised for you alone. It is the invisible friend who knows you better than you probably know yourself. And this is just part of what it can do.
  And here’s the scary part: Like the sci-fi robot models, it is still improving itself.
 How is the media going to take this? Are we going to run away or embrace it?
 I say we ride the waves. Navigate the rough seas but keep our feet firmly on the surfboard we are perched on.
 The media could make use of AI to better understand data and habits, improve efficiency and perhaps even in the production of certain content.
 But it remains just a tool, to be handled by real people. 
 We improve workflow but the ever-important journalistic rules and standards must be maintained.
 Customisation is attractive, of course. But it should never replace diversity in all aspects, and we need flesh and blood editors to lend their expertise and experience to exercise caution, maintain journalistic ethics and deal with prejudices.
 Of course, the best way to combat any type of competition is to embrace it, and to do this, we need to arm ourselves and learn all about it.
 That’s the plan, anyway.
 First things first. We fall back on our “armour”. 
 The Star is made up of a team of passionate and creative individuals always ready to switch tactics and go back to what we have been trained for – elevate the basic tenets of journalism, stand up for the people and deliver content to our audience through whatever platform they prefer.
 So, we let it be known that behind this invisible new “co-worker” of ours that can make sense of data in seconds, there are real people, in the form of editors huddling together, being gatekeepers.
 There are also journalists trained to cross-examine statements, talk to people and, of course, dig up and present a good story – with the human touch. That’s one of the greatest odds ever in our favour. For now, anyway.
 We need people of experience checking and killing fake news and not unintentionally spreading it like a machine would most be able to do.
 These days, anyone with a smartphone can call themselves a journalist, not knowing or caring that navigating through misinformation and fake news is a challenge all by itself.
 Perhaps this is the best time for trained journalists and traditional media to celebrate the foundations of journalism: getting the story right – something AI struggles to do at this point – being the bridge between the people and authorities, and analysing issues, besides influencing and shaping society.
 Most importantly, we need to give the people a voice. After all, we are what someone once called the curators of culture! 
 The role of the media is to tell stories of the people of the land, to reflect on the lives of the people whose voices it represents – their hopes and dreams, their joys and sadness.
 Perhaps this is the time for professional journalists to set themselves apart from all the noise and be what they have been trained for: to be the voice of reason.
 While we chart our future in this new world, we should be proud of retaining the basics of what made us journalists in the first place.
 Here’s to embracing the madness but always finding the time to step back and marvel at the process of telling the great stories waiting to be told.

702691,StarBiz,9,04/07/2024,Google’s emissions shoot up 48% over five years due to AI,,"NEW YORK: Google’s emissions have climbed by almost half over five years, as the company has infused artificial intelligence (AI) throughout many of its core products – making it harder to meet its goal of eliminating carbon emissions by 2030, according to a new environmental report from the tech giant.
 The annual report released covers Google’s progress toward meeting its environmental goals last year. 
 The Alphabet Inc unit said its greenhouse gas emissions totalled 14.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent throughout 2023. This is 48% higher than in 2019, the company said, and 13% higher than in 2022. 
 Google said higher energy consumption at its data centres and emissions from its supply chain were to blame, and said its push to add AI to its products could make it more difficult to reduce emissions going forward.
 “As we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,” Google said in the report.
 For several years, the Mountain View, California-based company has said it plans to eliminate such emissions from its operations by 2030.
 AI – and in particular generative AI, which takes in user inputs and spits out new content like text, images or songs – is extremely resource-intensive, as a recent Bloomberg News investigation showed. 
 As the technology grows rapidly, more and more data centres are needed to build and run it, leading to surging power requirements.
 The dramatic increase in power demands from Silicon Valley’s growth-at-all-costs approach to AI threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations as well as the clean energy goals of trillion-dollar tech companies. 
 In some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Malaysia, the energy required to run all the data centres they plan to build at full capacity exceeds the available supply of renewable energy, according to a Bloomberg analysis of the latest available data.
 Google is not the first major technology company to cite the rapid growth of AI as an obstacle to achieving environmental goals. 
 In May, Microsoft Corp said its carbon emissions climbed 30% since 2020, as the company increasingly invested in AI. The increase made that company’s target of getting to below net-zero emissions by 2030 even harder than it was when it announced its carbon-negative goal.
 Sasha Luccioni, climate lead at startup Hugging Face Inc, said the data show tech companies weren’t anticipating the massive growth of AI when they set their environmental goals. 
 “They couldn’t have,” she said. “The baseline year in that Google report was 2019 –  definitely not anticipating it.” — Bloomberg",york google emission half company artificial intelligence core product meet goal carbon emission environmental report tech giant annual report cover google progress meeting environmental goal unit greenhouse gas emission tonne carbon dioxide equivalent company google energy consumption data centre emission chain blame push product difficult emission product emission energy demand intensity compute emission increase technical infrastructure investment google report mountain view california company eliminate emission operation generative user input spit content text image resource intensive bloomberg news investigation technology data centre power requirement dramatic increase power demand silicon valley growth cost threatens energy transition plan entire nation energy goal dollar tech company country saudi arabia ireland malaysia energy data centre capacity exceeds renewable energy bloomberg analysis data major technology company rapid growth obstacle environmental goal corp carbon emission company increase company net emission carbon negative goal sasha luccioni climate lead startup data tech company massive growth environmental goal google report bloomberg,"[(13, 0.9937759)]",13
701567,StarBiz,12,02/07/2024,China’s AI startups head to Singapore in a bid for global growth,,"Singapore: When Wu Cunsong and Chen Binghui founded their artificial intelligence (AI) startup two years ago in Hangzhou, China, they quickly ran into obstacles, including dearth of venture capital. 
 This March, they did what scores of other Chinese AI firms have done and moved their company, Tabcut, 4,023km south-west to Singapore.
 The business-friendly country offers Wu and Chen better access to global investors and customers at a time when elevated geopolitical tensions keep many US and international firms away from China. 
 Equally crucial for an AI startup, they can buy Nvidia Corp’s latest chips and other cutting-edge technologies in the politically neutral island nation, something that would have been impossible in China because of US export controls.
 “We wanted to go to a place abundant with capital for financing, rather than a place where the availability of funds is rapidly diminishing,” Wu said in an interview.
 Singapore is emerging as a favourite destination for Chinese AI startups seeking to go global. While the city-state – with an ethnic Chinese majority – has long attracted companies from China, AI entrepreneurs in particular are accelerating the shift because trade sanctions imposed by the United States on their homeland block their access to the newest technologies.
 A base in Singapore is also a way for companies to distance themselves from their Chinese origins, a move often called “Singapore-washing”. 
 That’s an attempt to reduce scrutiny from customers and regulators in countries that are China’s political opponents, such as the United States.
 The strategy doesn’t always work: Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd moved the headquarters for its TikTok business to Singapore, but the popular video service was still hit by a new US law requiring the sale or ban of its American operations over security concerns. 
 Chinese fashion giant Shein, which also moved its base to Singapore, has faced intense criticism in the United States and is now aiming to go public in London instead of New York.
 But for AI startups, more is at stake than just perception. AI companies amass large amounts of data and rely on cutting-edge chips to train their systems, and if access is restricted the quality of their product will suffer. The United States has blocked sales of the most sophisticated chips and other technologies to China, to prevent them from being used for military and other purposes. OpenAI, the American generative-AI leader, is curbing China’s access to its software tools.
 China has also taken a strict approach to AI-generated content, trying to ensure it complies with the ruling Communist Party’s policies and propaganda. 
 The country made one of the world’s first major moves to regulate nascent technology last July, asking companies to register their algorithms with the government before they roll out consumer-facing services.
 That means that AI developers “won’t be able to engage in free explorations if they are in China”, said a founder of consulting firm Linkloud, who asked to be identified only by his first name Adam because of the sensitivity of the subject. 
 He estimated that 70% to 80% of Chinese software and AI startups target customers globally, with many now choosing to skip China altogether. Linkloud is building a community for Chinese AI entrepreneurs exploring global markets.
 Singapore’s AI regulations are less stringent and it’s known for the ease of setting up a company. The country wants to be a bridge between entrepreneurs from Asia and the world, said Chan Ih-Ming, executive vice-president of the Singapore Economic Development Board.
 “Many businesses and startups, including Chinese ones, choose Singapore as their hub for South-East Asia and see Singapore as a springboard to global markets,” he said. The city-state was home to more than 1,100 AI startups at the end of 2023, he said. 
 While Singapore doesn’t disclose data by country, evidence of China-based AI companies setting up shop is mounting.
 Jianfeng Lu is a pioneer of the trend, having moved to Singapore from the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing to establish his AI startup Wiz Holdings Pte in 2019. With backing from Tiger Global, GGV Capital and Hillhouse Capital, he built its speech recognition AI engine from the ground up, and sold customer-service bots to clients in Latin America, South-East Asia and northern Africa. He didn’t sell in China, a move his fellow founders term prescient.

701571,StarBiz,13,02/07/2024,Disruptive AI set to transform industry,Beijing’s tech giants scramble to roll out own versions,"Beijing: Competition is heating up the fast-developing field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), a cutting-edge disruptive technology that is expected to be increasingly applied to a wider range of sectors and spearhead a new round of industrial transformation and upgrade, domain experts say.
 Chinese technology companies, they said, should step up investment in improving computing power and algorithms and accumulate more high-quality training data, so as to gain an edge in the global AI race and narrow the gap with the United States in the latest tech frontier.
 Generative AI refers to computer algorithms trained with huge amounts of data capable of generating content such as images, text, audio and video in a human-like fashion. It is the key technology underpinning US-based research firm OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 The recent launch of GPT-4o, the latest large language model or LLM developed by OpenAI, has caused a global sensation. 
 New flagships
 The new flagship generative AI model surpasses the company’s existing models in visual and audio understanding, making the interaction between humans and machines much more natural and easier.
 LLMs are AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation.
 Industry insiders said the multimodal LLMs, which possess the abilities to process and generate content across multiple modalities, including text, images, audio and video, will lead the way for the further development of the generative AI industry, with significant potential for application in various industries like finance, retail, healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
 According to a report from global consultancy McKinsey & Co, generative AI will add between US$2.6 trillion and US$4.4 trillion in annual value to the global economy, enhancing all sectors of industry. 
 Banking, high technology and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact from generative AI.
 Major Chinese tech heavyweights, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc, iFlytek and Tencent Holdings Ltd, are scrambling to roll out their own AI-powered LLMs and bolster the commercial use of generative AI technology.
 In May, Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, unveiled Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, the latest version of its LLM, saying its capabilities have surpassed those of OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo model, the predecessor of GPT-4o.
 The Tongyi Qianwen 2.5 achieved a full upgrade with improved performance in reasoning, code comprehension and textual understanding compared with the previous version, the company said.
 In the context of Chinese language, the new model has caught up with the GPT-4 model in terms of text understanding and generation, knowledge quiz, dialogues and life advice, said Zhou Jingren, chief technology officer of Alibaba Cloud.
 Alibaba’s LLMs have been deployed by over 90,000 enterprise users in industries like consumer electronics, automobiles, education, healthcare, culture, tourism and gaming.
 “We look forward to collaborating with our customers and developers in seizing the immense growth opportunities presented by the latest surge in generative AI technology,” Zhou said, adding Alibaba Cloud will continue to contribute a diverse array of AI models to the open-source communities.
 Official data showed that the Chinese self-developed LLMs rank second in the world, and over 100 LLMs with more than one billion parameters each have been launched in China.
 Baidu said in April its LLM and ChatGPT-like chatbot Ernie Bot had garnered more than 200 million users since its debut in March 2023, while more than 85,000 enterprise clients had used Baidu’s enterprise-level LLM platform Qianfan to create 190,000 AI applications.
 Robin Li, co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Baidu, said the multimodal LLMs are key to the future development of AI technology, and this approach has been largely regarded as essential for realising artificial general intelligence or AGI, which is a theoretical AI system with capabilities that rival those of a human.
 Different emphasis
 He emphasised the biggest difference between China and some Western countries in terms of AI lies in applications, which are driving the rapid development of the AI industry in China.
 Li said in the US and Europe, everyone is trying to come up with cutting-edge foundation models. “In China, although there are hundreds of foundation models, people are increasingly talking about what the super app is for the AI age, or what is the killer app or the AI native app,” he noted. “We take more of an application-driven approach.
 “More people probably are focused on when GPT-5 will likely emerge, and what kind of new features we will be offering, but I’m more interested in what kind of application can take full advantage of the existing power of large language models.”
 Ernie 4.0, Baidu’s latest LLM, is better than the GPT-4 in Chinese because the company used a lot more Chinese data to train that model, Li said.
 Chinese AI company iFlytek announced in January that its upgraded LLM outperformed GPT-4 Turbo in metrics like language understanding and maths. For its part, eCommerce giant JD unveiled its LLM, the ChatRhino, which could be used in various fields, including retail, logistics, finance and health, as the company aims to bolster digital transformation and upgrade industries by using AI.
 Wang Peng, a researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said, “China’s major advantages in developing AI lie in abundant data resources and diversified industrial application scenarios, while the United States has taken the lead in basic AI research, chips, algorithms and other crucial technologies, as well as a sound innovation ecosystem.”
 Chinese enterprises should pool more resources to improve the quality of data that satisfy the training of LLMs, optimise algorithms, cultivate talent specialised in the field of AI and expand cooperation with leading international AI companies, Wang said.
 Lu Yanxia, research director at market research company International Data Corp (IDC) China, said Chinese tech companies’ continuous technological advancements in LLMs will further promote the popularisation of AI models, and bring fresh business opportunities for domestic AI servers, cloud computing and chip companies.
 Narrowing the gap
 She said tech enterprises should pool more resources to improve computing power, algorithms and quality of data to narrow the gap with the United States in the generative AI sector.
 The LLMs necessitate higher demand for data and knowledge in professional fields, and for talent that can fine-tune specialised models based on diverse industrial demands, she said.
 As various industries adopt the latest wave of digital transformation driven by AI, China’s spending on information and communications technology will increase by 9.8% year-on-year in 2024, surpassing the global average by two percentage points, IDC said.
 Pan Helin, a member of the Industry and Information Technology Ministry’s Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, said the training of multimodal AI models necessitates massive requirements for computing capacity, which will give a strong boost to the development of the computing  industry. — China Daily/ANN",competition field generative artificial intelligence edge disruptive technology wider range sector round industrial transformation upgrade domain expert chinese technology company investment power algorithm quality training data gain edge global race narrow gap tech generative refers computer algorithm huge amount data capable content image audio video human fashion key technology firm chatgpt launch gpt language model llm openai global sensation flagship generative model surpasses company model visual audio understanding interaction human machine natural easier llm model huge amount text data variety task natural language processing machine translation industry insider llm posse ability generate content multiple modality text image video lead development generative industry potential application industry finance retail healthcare intelligent report global consultancy generative annual global economy sector industry banking technology life science industry biggest impact generative major chinese tech heavyweight alibaba baidu iflytek tencent holding roll llm bolster commercial generative technology alibaba cloud cloud arm alibaba tongyi qianwen version llm capability openai gpt turbo model predecessor gpt tongyi qianwen upgrade performance code comprehension textual understanding previous version company chinese language model gpt model term understanding generation knowledge quiz life advice zhou jingren chief technology officer cloud alibaba llm enterprise user industry consumer electronics automobile education healthcare culture tourism customer developer immense growth opportunity generative technology zhou alibaba cloud contribute diverse array model source community official data chinese llm rank llm parameter china baidu april llm chatgpt chatbot ernie bot user march enterprise client enterprise level llm platform qianfan create application founder chairman chief executive officer baidu multimodal key future development technology approach essential artificial intelligence agi theoretical system capability human emphasis biggest difference china western country term application rapid development industry europe edge foundation model hundred foundation model people super app age killer app native app application approach people gpt emerge feature application advantage power language model baidu llm gpt chinese company lot chinese data train model chinese company iflytek january upgraded llm gpt turbo metric language understanding math giant llm chatrhino field retail logistics finance health company bolster digital transformation upgrade industry wang peng researcher academy social science major advantage lie abundant data resource industrial application scenario united lead basic chip crucial technology innovation ecosystem chinese enterprise pool resource quality data llm cultivate talent field cooperation international company yanxia director market company international data corp idc china chinese tech company continuous technological advancement llm promote popularisation model fresh business opportunity domestic server chip company gap tech pool resource power algorithm quality data narrow gap generative sector llm necessitate demand data professional field talent fine tune model diverse industrial demand industry digital transformation china spending communication technology increase global average percentage idc pan industry technology ministry expert committee communication economy multimodal model massive requirement capacity strong boost development industry daily ann,"[(13, 0.997723)]",13
701341,Main,13,01/07/2024,Many hooked on AI-generated boyfriend app,,"AN application known as Charac­ter AI allows girls to pick “boyfriends” generated by artificial intelligence from hundreds of choices, including celebrities, Kosmo! Ahad reported.As a result, it said Malaysian teenage girls were hooked on the app, spending hours text messaging their virtual boyfriends.
 Several of them said they enjo­y­ed their imaginary relationships as their virtual boyfriends were “always available, more romantic and understood them better”.
 A 17-year-old student, known as Alesya, said she was drawn to the app as it allowed her to choose the character of her boyfriend.
 “Also, virtual boyfriends do not judge us, unlike real boyfriends,” she said.
 Suraya, another teenager, said she used the app to chat with her favourite Korean celebrities.
 “It feels like I have a secret friend in my pocket. Although I know it is AI-generated and not real, it is not detrimental to me in any way. Most importantly, I know how to control myself,” she said.However, two parents said their daughters who were addic­ted to it showed behavioural changes since they started using the app.
 > With its reputation of being haunted, the century-old Kellie’s Castle in Batu Gajah, Perak, is attracting local visitors with a fascination for the paranormal.
 Mingguan Malaysia reported that many visitors claimed to have sighted an apparition of a woman, especially at a particular roofed balcony.
 The building’s managing director, Zamari Muhyi, said that apart from the balcony, there were three other “unnerving” locations, including the master bedroom.He said the entity would usually appear at the said balcony from 5.15pm onwards and several visitors had captured images of it.
 Zamari said the apparition was also active between midnight and 3am. He said several “experiments” conducted in the building in the past years substantiated claims of the hauntings.
 “In 2017, we explored the buil­ding for spirits with a group. A woman in the group was possessed by a spirit. Suddenly, she started speaking like a man. 
 “I asked who he was and he identified himself as Gopal, a laundry man who couldn’t return home to India. Upon his death, his spirit ended up wandering aimlessly in the building,” he said.
 > The daily also reported that Malaysians topped the list of being the most obese people in South-East Asia. This made them susceptible to premature death, non­-communicable diseases and other health conditions.
 It reported that Malaysia topped the list of nine countries followed by Thailand and Singa­pore, while the leanest people were from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.Health and dietary experts said the high obesity rate was attribu­ted to their intake of food and drinks high in sugar and calories. Other factors include the low consumption of fruits and vegetables.",application charac ter girl boyfriend artificial intelligence hundred choice celebrity result malaysian teenage girl app spending hour virtual boyfriend imaginary relationship virtual boyfriend romantic understood student alesya drawn app choose character virtual boyfriend judge real boyfriend teenager app favourite korean celebrity secret friend pocket real detrimental parent daughter behavioural app reputation century kellie castle batu gajah perak local visitor paranormal mingguan malaysia visitor apparition woman balcony building director zamari muhyi balcony unnerving location master bedroom entity balcony onwards visitor image apparition active midnight experiment building claim hauntings spirit woman spirit gopal laundry return india death spirit malaysian list obese people east asia susceptible premature death communicable health condition malaysia list country singa pore leanest people cambodia lao health dietary expert obesity rate attribu intake food drink sugar calorie factor low consumption fruit vegetable,"[(8, 0.99258935)]",8
700629,StarEdu,4,30/06/2024,AI for all,,"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), with the help of local and international artificial intelligence (AI) experts, has developed a basic structure for the curriculum that can be adopted by other institutions to create their own AI-focused curriculum.
 The varsity’s AI Faculty – a first for the country – is set to welcome the first batch of 120 Bachelor in AI degree students this October, with the number of seats to be increased over the years, said its dean Assoc Prof Dr Mohd Naz’ri Mahrin. 
 He said there are plans to offer Bachelor of AI with different specialities such as manufacturing or agriculture.
 “We need to have something that is more targeted because AI is everywhere, in every domain.This could lead to big, impactful results or change in the sector.
 “Also in the pipeline for us is a master’s degree by research and coursework, and PhD programmes in AI that we hope to offer by early next year,” he told StarEdu.
 While specialising in AI through Bachelor in Science programmes is not new in Malaysia, Mohd Naz’ri said what needs to be done now is to aggressively push, embrace and adopt AI in higher learning institutions.
 “We have been tasked to initiate this but it will be replicated by other universities later on. We will support them in developing their AI curriculum,” he said.
 Mohd Naz’ri said after Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced the establishment of the AI Faculty last year, UTM had met with then Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin to discuss its opening.
 “Mohamed Khaled (the current Defence Minister) said the government wanted more AI talent in the market. The government’s negotiations with investors and businesses also revealed that they need these talents in order to open up businesses here. In fact, it’s almost a ‘condition’ for them to invest and open shop here,” he shared.
 He said these companies want local AI manpower because it is more cost-effective.
 Globally, he added, there is a shortage of AI talent and countries like Japan are rushing to produce enough manpower to meet their industry needs.
 Malaysia alone needs about 200,000 AI talents according to the AI Roadmap 2021-2025, he said, adding that they will come from undergraduates, postgraduates and professional practices.
 While this number looks daunting, Mohd Naz’ri said the Higher Education Ministry has set up the Malaysian AI Consortium, which currently has 75 members, to be a platform for collaboration as they “cannot do this alone”.
 The consortium consists of all public universities, selected private universities that run AI-related programmes and some technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Ericsson.
 “We need to strategise and carry out this mandate together. I do not think we can do this in silos,” he added.
 Last month, Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir officiated the launch of the faculty at the UTM Kuala Lumpur campus.
 In his speech, the Higher Education Minister said Malaysia’s first Faculty of AI would lead the way in the integration and teaching of AI throughout the country amid today’s rapidly changing technology.
 Describing the faculty as “a catalyst for an integrated AI education system”, he said it showcased Malaysia’s readiness for AI transformation in higher education.
 International Islamic University of Malaysia Emeritus Prof Datuk Dr Osman Bakar, who was also present at the launch on May 10, said the AI faculty should explore and come up with a code of ethics for AI professionals.
 Stressing that AI will not see the end of jobs for humans, Universiti Malaysia Kelantan Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (AIBIG) director Dr Muhammad Akmal Remli said, for the most part, it will transform the work people do.
 “We must embrace these changes or risk falling behind. This shift is not just necessary; it’s a chance to improve our educational practices. At its core, education is about more than just imparting knowledge and student development; it is about fostering humanity, skills and integrity.
 “The key is not to replace learning outcomes or content with AI but to use AI to assist in student understanding and make the learning process easier and more enjoyable,” he added.",universiti teknologi malaysia utm local international artificial intelligence expert basic structure curriculum institution curriculum varsity faculty country batch bachelor degree student seat dean assoc prof mohd naz mahrin plan bachelor speciality agriculture domain lead impactful change sector pipeline master degree coursework phd programme hope offer staredu bachelor science programme mohd naz push embrace adopt institution initiate university curriculum mohd naz prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim establishment faculty utm education minister datuk seri current defence minister government talent market government negotiation investor business talent business condition shop company local manpower cost effective talent country manpower meet industry malaysia talent roadmap undergraduate postgraduate professional practice mohd naz education ministry malaysian consortium platform collaboration consortium public university private university programme technology company microsoft ericsson strategise carry silo month datuk seri zambry abd kadir launch faculty utm kuala lumpur campus speech education minister malaysia faculty lead integration country technology faculty catalyst education system malaysia readiness transformation education international islamic university malaysia emeritus prof datuk osman bakar launch faculty explore code ethic professional job human universiti malaysia kelantan institute artificial intelligence data aibig director muhammad akmal remli transform people risk shift chance educational practice education student development humanity skill integrity key outcome content assist student process enjoyable,"[(6, 0.995162)]",6
700631,StarEdu,5,30/06/2024,AI-ding online learning,,"ONLINE learning – especially student outcomes – will benefit greatly from artificial intelligence (AI).
 OpenLearning.com founder and chief executive officer Adam Brimo said generative AI (GenAI) can be used to solve issues, such as learning design, that have been plaguing online learning platforms.
 “Educators and software designers are now trying to ‘morph software’ to create online lesson modules.
 “We have these ideas of what we want but the platform doesn’t support it so we are always trying to find a way to work around it,” he said, adding that now with AI, online learning providers are able to better design and customise lessons for different student outcomes.“You can tell ChatGPT 4 that ‘this course is going to be a learning based credit course’ or ‘I want my outcome to be structured on Bloom’s Taxonomy or socio-emotional learning’.
 “With AI, we can contextualise and develop content suited to the application in a way we couldn’t before,” Brimo said, adding that it is also now possible to build courses and programmes that deliver much better outcomes.
 He said over the past year, OpenLearning.com has built a range of tools specifically focused on how to implement best practices by having AI act as a “virtual learning designer”.Singapore Education Network founder and managing director Michael Klemm said there is a need to have structured training and implementation of digital tools for educators, both in school and in higher learning institutions.
 “In universities, the biggest obstacle is that teachers and educators don’t have enough time for professional learning or there’s no incentive to do so.
 “Universities need to use the technology and make it easily accessible and really user-friendly,” he said, adding that any initiative taken to use AI is usually the result of an educator’s own efforts.
 Brimo and Klemm were among the panellists of the Times Higher Education (THE) Asia Universities Summit 2024 held from April 29 to May 1 at Sunway University.

700781,Main,12,30/06/2024,AI scams targeting travellers,"Govt intervention needed in regulating OTAs, Airbnb operators","PETALING JAYA: Stronger regulation and protection is needed with the alarming rise of scams powered by artificial intelligence (AI) targeting hoteliers and travellers, say industry players.
 Malaysia Budget & Business Hotel Association president Dr Sri Ganesh Michiel said although such cases are rare in Malaysia following close cooperation between hoteliers and online travel agencies (OTA), it is still a cause for concern.
 He highlighted the urgent need for government intervention in regulating OTAs, including Airbnb operators, many of which are based overseas.
 “There must be clear procedures for collecting personal information for domestic and international travel bookings to thwart fake reservations, fictitious accommodations, and phishing schemes facilitated through malicious APK downloads and external links.
 “For example, one should not be allowed to register or make a booking using fake names before verifying his identity.
 “Regulation is crucial to prevent data abuse and ensure customer safety. Measures like strict policies on links and two-step identifications are being implemented by Booking.com to enhance security.
 “There is a need for laws and regulations to control online platforms and consumer behaviour,” he said.
 A report by the chief information security officer of a leading online travel website, Booking.com has noted a sharp rise in global phishing attacks targeting the hospitality sector.
 Using AI, it said scammers create realistic emails to trick people into divulging sensitive data like credit cards or personal information.
 “For Booking.com to raise the alarm, it means it’s a dangerous trend, as AI can learn and get smarter.
 “The platform’s warning underscores the evolving capabilities of AI and the diverse methods perpetrators can exploit to deceive and compromise individuals making travel bookings,” Sri Ganesh said in an interview yesterday.
 He noted that except for some individual operators, hoteliers in Malaysia have been working closely with travel platforms like Booking.com and Traveloka and it has helped to address issues effectively.
 “The coordination and sharing of information among industry stakeholders have improved to prevent and mitigate scams.
 “We are always taught the latest trends and tactics and how to spot possibly fraudulent emails before clicking on any link.”
 Malaysian Association of Hotels president Datin Christina Toh said that smaller players may be more vulnerable to scams as large international chains have the tech and cybersecurity support systems in place to handle these challenges.
 “Nonetheless, these companies usually have mechanisms to detect and prevent such incidents, including working with their system providers.
 “Hotels usually work collaboratively with platforms like Booking.com to identify and address such issues.
 “That’s why frequent training and education of hotel staff on the telltale signs of scams is a regular practice to strengthen defences,” she said.
 Toh noted that the rapid response capabilities of OTAs are vital in managing these problems, making close cooperation between OTAs and hoteliers essential for maintaining online security and trust in the industry.
 Such support is crucial to helping these smaller entities manage and potentially circumvent cyber threats effectively,” she said.
 Malaysian Tourism Federation president Datuk Tan Kok Liang recommended proactive steps for travel operators to protect against AI-enabled phishing scams such as providing employee education and training.
 “Customers should also be informed about potential scams and taught how to verify the authenticity of communications from the business,” he added.  Tan said that establishing secure communication channels is also critical to safeguarding business interactions, and installing robust cybersecurity tools would also help protect against digital threats.
 “Finally, conducting regular security audits will help identify and address vulnerabilities, enhancing safety and confidence in online transactions,” he said.",jaya stronger regulation protection rise scam artificial intelligence hotelier traveller industry player budget business hotel association president sri ganesh michiel rare malaysia close cooperation hotelier travel agency concern urgent government intervention otas airbnb operator overseas procedure personal domestic international travel booking fake reservation fictitious accommodation malicious apk downloads external link register fake name identity regulation crucial prevent data abuse customer safety measure strict policy step identification enhance security law regulation online platform consumer report chief security officer online travel sharp rise global phishing attack hospitality sector scammer realistic email trick people sensitive data credit card personal booking raise dangerous trend smarter platform warning underscore capability diverse method perpetrator deceive compromise individual booking ganesh interview yesterday individual operator hotelier travel platform traveloka issue industry stakeholder prevent mitigate scam trend tactic fraudulent email link malaysian association hotel president datin christina toh player vulnerable scam international chain cybersecurity support system handle challenge company detect prevent incident system provider hotel address issue frequent education hotel staff telltale sign scam regular practice strengthen defence rapid response capability vital close cooperation hotelier essential online security trust industry support crucial entity circumvent cyber threat malaysian tourism federation president datuk tan kok liang proactive step travel operator scam employee education training customer potential scam verify authenticity communication business secure communication channel critical safeguarding business interaction robust cybersecurity tool digital threat regular security audit address vulnerability safety confidence online transaction,"[(4, 0.9958501)]",4
700467,Main,14,29/06/2024,Will AI-based teaching systems replace human teachers?,,"WITH the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the education sector is experiencing unprecedented changes. As AI applications in teaching become increasingly widespread, some are asking if AI teaching can coexist with human teaching. Will it replace traditional teaching methods, or can it complement them to enhance education quality?
 Among the benefits AI can offer is personalised instruction based on a student’s learning progress, automatically adjusting the content to pace the student. Also, AI teaching systems can operate around the clock, allowing students access anytime and anywhere, which is challenging to achieve with traditional teaching.
 However, I believe human teachers play a role in education that cannot be entirely replaced. Teachers are not just transmitters of knowledge; they are guides to and supporters of a student’s growth. Through interaction with students, teachers can inspire interest in learning, cultivate critical thinking and foster creativity – tasks that I think AI would find difficult to accomplish. Moreover, teachers can offer emotional support, helping students overcome learning obstacles and confusion.
 I think AI teaching and human teaching can form a complementary relationship rather than one replacing the other. AI can handle repetitive and mechanical tasks, reducing the workload on teachers and allowing them more time to engage with students. 
 For instance, in language learning, AI can use speech recognition and natural language processing technology to help students practise listening and speaking, enhancing learning efficiency. And human teachers can engage in discussions and interactions, helping students understand cultural contexts and nuances, making learning more profound.
 Additionally, in massive open online courses (MOOCs), AI can automatically grade assignments and tests, providing instant feedback, while teachers can facilitate indepth discussions and interactions through online forums and video conferences.
 I believe the coexistence of AI teaching and human teaching is the future trend in education development. We should fully utilise the advantages of AI technology while also valuing and leveraging the irreplaceable role of human teachers in education. Only in this way can we achieve a comprehensive improvement in education quality and cultivate more innovative and well-rounded talents.

700571,StarBiz 7,5,29/06/2024,Raging debate over the pros and cons of AI,,"THE world is in a mess, and the acceleration of artificial Intelligence (AI) usage is disrupting every business and the way we live. 
 We are all struggling to understand what the AI transition means for each of us as consumers, parents, teachers, businesses or government leaders. 
 The debate over the pros and cons of AI is raging, especially in its dual military-civilian usage. AI will guide the next drone or missile at you with faster accuracy than ever imagined. 
 It can also develop the next miracle drug to change our health. We simply do not know what the outcome whether AI is ultimately good or bad – only that the bandwidth of risk and opportunity is widening at frightening speed. 
 We have never seen technology being adopted in daily activities in terms of speed, scale and scope as AI. The AI revolution has pushed the Nvidia and other AI platform stock valuations into the trillion-dollar league. 
 Big powers and big platforms are all investing in AI, trying to figure out how to beat the competitors in achieving scale and domination. 
 The digital divide means that those who are ahead in AI will be richer, faster, smarter and more powerful, whereas those who don’t implement AI tools are being marginalised.   
 Clearly, the rich and advanced economies stand to gain more from AI and technology, whereas emerging and developing market economies are still struggling on how to use AI to help them develop or at the minimum, tackle their myriad problems of people and planetary injustices. 
 The most obvious benefit of AI is that it could improve productivity, which has declined globally across the board for several decades. 
 McKinsey research suggests human-centric generative AI adoption may well automate up to 30% of business activities across occupations by 2030.   
 Analysing 63 user cases, they estimated that generative AI could add roughly US$2.6 trillion to US$4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, equivalent to adding 2.5% to 4.2% to current global gross domestic product, which has been forecast by the World Bank to slow down to half the growth before the global crisis in 2008. 
 The potential for turning around development in multi-directions using AI looks huge. How can this be achieved?
 AI is essentially a human-invented tool for learning and using for change. 
 Given the right amount of data, it can help make better decisions and eliminate inefficiencies in the system.   It can also do bad things at scale. 
 Ethics in the usage of AI is at the heart of the current debate. In the wrong hands, AI is what historian Yuval Noah Harari calls “data colonisation and digital dictatorship”. 
 Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz propounded that the job of governments was to create a learning (knowledge) society, since knowledge is a public good. 
 Fellow Nobel Laureate Robert Solow (1924-2023) first quantitatively identified that the most important determinant of economic growth was technological change. 
 Kenneth Arrow (1921-2017) showed that markets by themselves do not yield efficiency in the production and dissemination of knowledge. 
 More recent case studies on building tech ecosystems showed that learning is really about copying or imitating global knowledge and adapting these to local needs. 
 South Korean Professors Kim and Lee (2022) showed that Taipei and Shenzhen evolved into tech powerhouses by first importing foreign technology through welcoming multinational companies and then developing local champions that increased research and development, primarily in process engineering, and then moving to original ideas, products and services that began to rival foreign competitors. 
 In short, human learning is always about copying others and then personalising or internalising such knowledge to create new ideas and actions.  
 This “copy-learn-adapt-innovate-scale” approach is exactly the path that AI usage is following. 
 When we face something totally new, we have four essential choices. The first is to deny or reject because we fear the unknown. The second for those who are curious is to learn and experiment. The third is to do nothing or simply follow the crowd, because that appears to be the safest way out of disruptive change. The brave and risk-takers are those who decide to leap into the unknown and become innovative or entrepreneurs. These become the change agents. 
 In today’s existential threats of nuclear war, ecological collapse and technological disruption, doing nothing or business-as-usual is not an option. You either eat lunch or become lunch. 
 There is no complacency shown in the financial sector, with the Bank of International Settlements and  Citigroup Inc recently warning about the profound impact and opportunities and threats of AI on the financial landscape. 
 The amount of startups working on implementing AI in different domains is staggering.  In 2023, close to US$315bil was invested in tech companies globally, a large chunk being in AI applications. 
 The World Economic Forum (WEF) has been promoting application of AI in social innovation to tackle social and ecological issues. Although the WEF report stressed that “Artificial intelligence has the potential to scale impact in several domains but requires collaboration to help social innovators realise its maximum potential”, the greatest barriers to successful AI implementation are lack of trust, partnerships and funding. 
 The pattern in adopting AI in every domain, from personal to communities, businesses and government is common.  You must approach change from a complex system perspective, noting that there are no simple one-size-fit-all solutions. 
 Change management is not rocket science - it is about changing mindsets, addressing vested interests, and having the passion and management skills to execute change. 
 An excellent Japanese study on regulation shows that 20% of staff time are spent on compliance issues, so that small and medium enterprises face overwhelming costs and barriers to deal with daily regulatory and bureaucratic issues. Just simplifying overlapping silos in bureaucracies using AI tools could increase productivity by 8%. 
 In sum, we all need to adopt AI tools to generate the productivity that is needed to achieve more with less. Although change is best tackled bottom-up, it needs leadership, courage and passion to engineer change.

699991,StarBiz,8,28/06/2024,"AI’s green benefits will outweigh its emissions, says Bill Gates",,"LONDON: Billionaire climate tech investor Bill Gates says artificial intelligence (AI) will “pay for itself” when it comes to its associated greenhouse gas emissions, as the technology will help push forward the energy transition. 
 AI will make data centres more efficient, helping them represent a smaller share of future power demand, he said in a Bloomberg TV interview. 
 Gates said the technology may one day use as much as 6% of global electricity – more than the estimated 2% today – but felt estimates above 10% were wrong. 
 His comments come after AI has received increased scrutiny amid expectations that it will dramatically raise energy needs. 
 In some parts of the world, demand from data centres is already outstripping the available power supply, a trend which threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations. 
 Gates countered the additional demand from electric cars, heat pumps, and green steel manufacturing will all “dwarf even this amazing demand for data centres now.”

700017,StarBiz,12,28/06/2024,Micron selloff shows risk of sky-high AI expectations,,"New York: Micron Technology Inc’s post-results selloff sent a fresh reminder to global investors about the risks inherent in bets on artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakers.
 Days after leading AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp slumped by nearly half a trillion US dollars, Micron shares fell about 8% in extended trading after the memory maker offered a forecast that fell short of the highest estimates. 
 In a sign of the extreme volatility in AI-related stocks, Micron’s news also triggered drops in South Korea’s two biggest companies, Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc, as fellow memory chip providers feeding the AI supply chain.
 Micron is one of the many companies that have gotten a lift from the mania for AI-related stocks, as its high-bandwidth memory is a candidate for use alongside Nvidia’s industry-leading chips for training large language models. 
 Its shares had more than doubled in the year prior to its Wednesday report, but even with an outlook roughly in line with the average of analyst estimates the company was punished for not outperforming elevated expectations.
 “The market is holding totally unrealistic expectations, as many names who are beating street estimates by a wide margin are still being sold down,” said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors Pte in Singapore.
 “But I think the street is very well aware of the fact that these US names are pretty overcooked. Too many paper hands chasing the fast easy money.”
 Momentum in the global AI frenzy took a hit earlier this week when Nvidia shares entered correction territory on Monday before bouncing back. 
 A global gauge tracking semiconductor shares fell about 5% since reaching an all-time high earlier this month.
 For businesses like Micron, whose traditional output of supplying memory for PCs, smartphones and more conventional data centre use is still recovering from a slump last year, that means a great degree of share price uncertainty.
 The US memory maker’s briefing fell short of what SK Hynix offered earlier, when it announced its High Bandwidth Memory production capacity is largely sold out through 2025, said Tom Kang, director at Counterpoint Research. 
 Micron lacks the strong position in AI SK Hynix enjoys or in the broader memory industry that Samsung has, he added.
 “This brings a reality check to the AI sector, which looks bubblish,” Kang said.
 The relentless rally in US mega caps that are seen as benefiting from AI has pushed their shares to historically high valuations.

699615,Lifestyle,3,27/06/2024,K-pop industry leverages on AI,,"THE K-pop industry has begun using artificial intelligence in making music videos and songs for K-pop artistes in line with technological advancements.
 K-pop boy band Seventeen, for instance, introduced the music video for its latest song, Maestro, last month with a scene created by AI.
 The music video makes its viewers question who is the real maestro, when the subject responsible for creation is unclear, in a world where virtually everything can be made with AI.
 Seventeen’s Woozi, who has produced various hit singles for the group, said during a press conference introducing the group’s 17 Is Right Here album in Seoul last month, that he has experience experimenting with AI while creating music.
 “We practised making songs with AI, as we want to develop along with technology rather than complain about it. 
 “Through these experiments, we discovered the strengths and weaknesses of composing music with AI,” said Woozi. 
 “We also contemplate how to protect our musical identity in this world where AI can create music,” he said.
 Girl group Aespa also used AI in the music video for its latest song, Supernova, the lead track of its LP released on May 27.
 In the music video, there is a close-up scene in which Aespa members are singing, with  only their mouths moving unnaturally.
 “We did not expect such a scene. This got us thinking about AI as these days, cover songs created by AI are popular on social media. 
 “But I still think AI cannot perfectly imitate a person’s facial expression or emotions,” said Ningning of Aespa during a press conference introducing its first LP in Seoul on May 27.
 SM founder and former chief producer Lee Soo-man also spoke about the applications of AI in K-pop during his keynote speech at the General Assembly of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers in Seoul on May 30.
 “AI will help K-pop connect with its fans around the world. 
 “It’s a convergence of culture and technology that I’ve been talking about for a while now, and it will allow deeper engagement between celebrities and ‘prosumers’, or fans,” Lee said.
 In May 2023, singer Lee Hyun re-debuted as Midnatt, an alter ego created through AI technology, under Hybe.
 Midnatt released single Masquerade, featuring a female voice generated with AI using the male singer’s own voice.
 The song was also released in six languages – Korean, English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish – using the multilanguage transformation technology of Supertone, a sound AI startup acquired by Hybe in 2021.
 AI could be a game changer in the K-pop market, one expert says.
 “In the past, the problem with AI-adapted songs was that they could not add hints of emotions, but now they can also do this, enabling the nearly perfect production of AI-adapted albums. 
 “As the limitations of the possibilities that can be achieved with AI are decreasing, AI will have a significant impact on the music industry in the future, if not immediately,” said Kim Sung-soo, a culture critic. – The Korea Herald/Asia News Network",pop industry artificial intelligence music video song technological advancement boy band seventeen instance music video song maestro month scene music video viewer real maestro subject responsible creation unclear seventeen woozi hit single press conference album seoul month experience music song technology complain experiment strength weakness music woozi contemplate musical identity create music girl aespa music video song supernova lead track music video close scene aespa mouth scene day song popular social medium imitate person facial expression emotion aespa press conference seoul founder chief producer lee application pop keynote speech international confederation society author composer pop connect fan convergence culture technology deeper engagement celebrity prosumers fan lee singer lee hyun midnatt alter ego technology hybe midnatt single masquerade female voice male singer voice song language korean english vietnamese chinese japanese spanish multilanguage transformation technology supertone sound startup game changer pop market expert song hint emotion perfect production album limitation possibility impact music industry future kim sung soo culture critic korea herald asia news network,"[(9, 0.2371638), (14, 0.7570154)]",14
698631,Lifestyle,4,24/06/2024,Era of AI smartphone,AI takes  centre stage as tech giants unveil radical updates to transform our smartphones  this year.,"EVERY year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, such as cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. 
 This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are  focusing on reinventing our phones  with artificial intelligence.
 At its annual software developer  conference, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. 
 The new tools include a revamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an AI system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles, and craft responses to text messages and emails.
 Apple’s news followed Google’s Android announcements last month, which included an AI system that automatically summarises audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam, and helps students with homework.
 Because AI tech is still new, it’s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. 
 The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages – also known as  the green bubble. 
 Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to  communicate for more than a decade.
 As Apple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android, here’s what to know about how our smartphones will change.
 Siri gets brain transplant
 Apple said it had completely reworked Siri, its 13-year-old virtual assistant.
 The assistant will soon be powered by Apple Intelligence, the company’s version of a “large language model”. 
 That type of AI technology uses statistics and complex algorithms to guess what words belong together, similar to the autocomplete feature on your phone. 
 It’s the same type of underlying technology we’ve seen powering chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Apple said its system was more private than others’ because people’s data would remain on their iPhones.
 The upgrade will make Siri capable of processing the context of a conversation, and allow users to speak more naturally with the virtual assistant. For instance, you could say, “What’s the weather in Santa Cruz? Oh wait, I meant San Francisco” followed by “Schedule a coffee meeting there tomorrow at 9am”.
 The new and more capable Siri will also be able to handle more complex tasks, such as searching your photo album for an image of your driver’s licence and pulling the ID number to paste into a form, Apple said.
 In contrast, the old version of Siri could react only to a database of  commands and questions it was  programmed to understand, such as “What’s the weather in San Francisco?” and “Schedule a coffee meeting in San Francisco.”
 Apple Intelligence will also enable iPhone users to automatically generate images inside messages, Apple said. For instance, if you wish a friend a happy birthday, the AI could review your photo album for an image of that friend, after which it could generate an avatar of that person with balloons.
 The AI will also be usable in writing apps such as Mail and Notes. Users can highlight text for proofreading or rewriting in a different style. Inside the Safari web browser, users can also highlight articles to generate short summaries.
 Apple said it had formed a partnership with OpenAI so that Siri could tap into ChatGPT for help with tasks like generating a list of recipe ideas.
 The AI features are arriving only on the newest, fastest iPhones, including  the iPhone 15 Pro.
 Overhauling Android with Gemini
 Only owners of Google’s Pixel phones can use most of Google’s latest AI features; support for other Android devices is expected later this year.
 For the past year, Google has let users test Gemini, its new AI assistant, which requires downloading an app. (By default, Android phones will still come loaded with Google Assistant, the virtual assistant that is similar to Amazon’s Alexa and the older version of Siri.) Similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Gemini acts like a chatbot that generates responses to whatever prompt you throw at it, including “write a poem about dogs in San Francisco”.
 A new version of Gemini, called Nano, focuses on handling AI tasks directly on Pixel phones rather than processing the requests on Google’s servers, for privacy purposes.
 One feature for scam detection involves using AI to listen to your phone calls. If the conversation fits the pattern of a scam, such as a fraudster asking for your online banking password, an alert is sent to your phone.
 Another feature, called Circle to Search, lets users circle an image to ask Google for information. This feature has now been expanded to let students circle a maths or physics problem for help. Google’s AI will then generate a list of steps on how to solve the problem.
 Gemini Nano can also take a transcript automatically generated from an audio recording and create written summaries, which could be useful for meetings. Another tool, called Magic Compose, can be used inside Google’s Messages app to quickly rewrite a message in a different style.
 Improvements to texting
 For more than a decade, smartphone users everywhere have confronted the green versus blue bubble divide. When iPhone users send texts to other iPhones, the messages appear blue and can tap into exclusive perks like fun emojis and animations. But if an iPhone user texts an Android user, the bubble turns green, many features break, and photos and videos deteriorate in quality.
 Apple is finally taking a step towards bridging that divide. It said that in iOS 18, its messages app would adopt Rich Communication Services, a standard that Google and others integrated into their apps years ago. Texts sent between iPhones and Androids will remain green, but images and videos will be of higher quality.
 The result will probably be profound. Many iPhone and Android users said they felt discouraged from sending messages to one another because the image quality was poor. The Justice Department, which earlier this year accused Apple of placing restrictions on its phones to maintain a monopoly, viewed the messaging incompatibility as a pressure tactic to persuade people to buy iPhones. – The New York Times",apple google major software feature smartphones cosmetic overhaul screen stronger privacy protection tool radical company phone artificial intelligence annual software developer conference apple host enhancement io system iphones tool version voice assistant siri easier talk system generate image summary article response text message apple news google android announcement month system audio transcript phone conversation scam student homework tech unclear improvement mass school text message green bubble apple software standard iphone user quality message issue difficult people decade apple google release free software io android smartphones brain transplant apple siri virtual assistant assistant apple intelligence company version language model type technology statistic complex algorithm guess autocomplete feature phone type technology chatbots chatgpt google gemini apple system private people remain iphones upgrade siri capable context conversation user virtual assistant instance weather santa cruz wait san francisco schedule coffee meeting tomorrow capable siri handle complex task photo album image driver licence paste form apple contrast version siri react database question understand weather san francisco schedule coffee meeting san francisco apple intelligence enable iphone user image message apple instance friend happy birthday review photo album image friend generate avatar person balloon usable apps mail note user text proofreading style safari web browser user article short summary apple partnership openai siri tap chatgpt task list recipe idea feature fastest iphones iphone pro android gemini owner pixel phone feature android device google user gemini assistant default android phone google assistant virtual assistant amazon alexa version siri chatgpt gemini chatbot generates response throw write poem dog san francisco version gemini nano focus task phone request server purpose scam detection phone call conversation pattern scam fraudster online banking password alert phone feature circle search user image google feature student circle math physic generate list step gemini nano transcript audio create summary meeting tool compose google message rewrite message style improvement decade smartphone user green versus blue bubble divide iphone user text iphones message tap exclusive perk emojis animation user text user bubble green feature photo video deteriorate quality apple divide io message rich communication service standard google text iphones android green image quality result iphone android user message image quality poor justice department apple restriction phone monopoly messaging incompatibility pressure tactic persuade people iphones york time,"[(0, 0.044957045), (6, 0.9526143)]",6
697541,StarBiz,4,21/06/2024,What an innovative Japanese AI unicorn can teach Silicon Valley,,"SILICON Valley’s “move fast and break things” mantra propelled tech innovation for the Internet age.
 In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), it should take a leaf out of Japan’s playbook and slow down.
 A rush to deploy AI tools to the public has resulted in embarrassing blunders, from an AI-powered Google search feature recently recommending glue on pizza, to consequences that can impact real people’s livelihoods, like the technology behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT showing signs of racial bias when ranking job applicants, as a Bloomberg analysis found.
 It has also led to tech companies consuming enormous amounts of energy to power AI. The International Energy Agency estimates the total electricity consumption for data centres across the globe will be roughly equivalent to the power demand of Japan in 2026.
 Other forecasters said that by 2030, these centres are on course to use more energy than India, the world’s most populous country. Large language models, the technology underpinning the latest crop of generative AI tools, require gargantuan troves of data and training them takes immense amounts of computing power and energy.
 As the tech continues to develop, many AI firms think the key to growth is to make these large language models even larger. 
 Some US tech titans including Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates and OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman are even backing nuclear energy firms to help power AI data centres. But there are other options beyond rushing to fire up new nuclear reactors to train AI models.
 Tokyo-based startup Sakana AI – which Nikkei Asia reported on June 15 will become the fastest-ever Japanese company to achieve unicorn status – has taken a different approach. When it comes to the most consequential technology of our time, it’s playing the long game.
 Sakana, which means fish in Japanese, was created last year by David Ha, Ren Ito and Llion Jones with the goal of applying nature-inspired ideas such as evolution and collective intelligence to create AI models, and not gobbling up as much energy as possible to train a single AI model.
 Jones, notably, co-authored the seminal 2017 research paper while at Google that underpins the technology of today’s most popular AI products, including ChatGPT, and spurred much of the current boom.
 Ha told me that much of the issues facing AI stem from companies prematurely deploying the technology in search of short-term profits, while disregarding the high energy toll.
 While Sakana’s technology could be used to create a virtual girlfriend chatbot now, it’s more focused on researching ways to apply AI to solve real-world issues. 
 This is in line with other Japan-based AI companies the West may have never heard of, such as Preferred Networks, which is trying to develop more energy-efficient AI chips.
 Silicon Valley needs to start playing the more long game, too. The world doesn’t need more useless chatbots that generate bad poetry – or perpetuate racist biases at scale – while consuming unsustainable swaths of resources. This way of thinking could have also spared some of the embarrassing headlines that have turned much of the public against embracing AI for good.
 Sakana’s most recent research is looking at new ways of producing AI models that don’t require extensive amounts of energy, and it has longer-term ambitions of helping Japan at a national scale come up with real solutions to some of its most pressing issues, including a looming labour crunch. 
 Its mission has received support from the Japanese government.
 In Japan, depopulation and a shrinking workforce have led to a public and private sector ecosystem that seeks to embrace the emerging technology’s possibilities with curiosity and hope instead of despair. 
 There is a sense of urgency around the idea that these tools can help solve labour shortages – with less of the existential fears that they will end up replacing human workers.
 Microsoft Japan president Miki Tsusaka touted generative AI’s power to accelerate growth in a nation with an ageing population in an interview with Bloomberg TV earlier this week. Her comments come on the heels of Microsoft announcing it will spend some US$2.9bil, its biggest-ever investment in Japan, to increase cloud computing and AI infrastructure.
 Along with Microsoft, OpenAI opened its first Asia office in Tokyo this spring, while Oracle Corp pledged to put more than US$8bil over the next 10 years into cloud computing and AI. — Bloomberg

697221,StarBiz,14,20/06/2024,US seeks help to curb China’s AI chip progress,Washington to ask allies to impose fresh restrictions,"WASHINGTON: A senior American official is set to visit Japan and the Netherlands to ask the two countries to add fresh restrictions on China’s semiconductor sector, including on its ability to make the high-end memory chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).
 US Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez will press his counterparts in Tokyo and The Hague to put more limits on the activities in China of Dutch supplier ASML Holding NV and Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd, according to people familiar with the matter. 
 Estevez’s requests, part of an ongoing dialogue with allies, will highlight Chinese chip factories developing so-called high-bandwidth memory chips, said the people, asking not to be identified because the discussions were private.
 ASML and Tokyo Electron machines are used to produce dynamic random access memory dies, which are stacked together to make high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. 
 Chinese companies working on HBM chips include Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of China’s leading memory chipmaker Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, according to China’s corporate data provider Qichacha. 
 Huawei Technologies Co and ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc are also reportedly developing HBM. 
 The Biden administration has tried for years to limit China’s ability to buy and produce advanced semiconductors, arguing such steps are necessary for national security. 
 Yet results have been mixed, with Huawei and others making significant advances. 
 The US is seeking support from allies, who have implemented their own less stringent controls, to create a more effective global blockade.
 “The United States is the most critical player in the global semiconductor equipment industry, but it’s far from the only country that matters” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Centre for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. 
 “Japan and the Netherlands are also key providers of semiconductor equipment. The Netherlands and Japan have restrictions on exports but not on servicing, and that’s a critical limitation in the overall technology controls architecture.”
 Estevez is expected to repeat a standing US request for the two countries to tighten restrictions on ASML and Tokyo Electron’s ability to maintain and repair their other advanced equipment in China as well, the people said. 
 The United States has already imposed such restrictions on American rivals, such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp. 
 The US delegation’s visit to the Netherlands is expected to take place after the new Dutch cabinet is sworn in the first week of July. 
 Reinette Klever of far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party is set to become the Foreign Trade and Development Aid Minister, a role that typically oversees the country’s export control policies. 
 The Dutch and Japanese governments have been resisting the US pressure, people familiar with the matter said earlier. The two countries want more time to evaluate the impact of current export bans on high-end chip-making equipment and to see the outcome of the US presidential election in November. 
 It is uncertain how the new Dutch government led by Wilders will react to US demands for additional measures. 
 Klever is co-founder of a far-right TV channel Ongehoord Nederland, which stirred controversy for its pro-Russian reporting and climate change scepticism. 
 The outgoing Foreign Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher paid a farewell visit to the United States last week to lobby for the interests of ASML. 
 Dutch King Willem-Alexander joined Schreinemacher in a meeting with New York governor Kathy Hochul.
 A representative of the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security declined to comment. 
 A spokesperson for the Dutch foreign trade ministry declined to comment. Japan’s Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
 HBM chips are an indispensable part of the AI hardware ecosystem because they speed up access to memory, helping AI development. 
 AI accelerators, made by Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, need to be bundled with HBM chips for them to work. 
 US officials are having early-stage conversations about restricting the export of HBM chips, Bloomberg has reported.
 SK Hynix Inc is the leading producer of HBM chips, with Samsung Electronics Co and US-based Micron Technology Inc pressing to catch up. 
 SK Hynix relies on equipment from ASML and Tokyo Electron, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain data. 
 South Korean equipment makers, including Hanmi Semiconductor Co and Hanwha Precision Machinery Co, also play a critical role in the HBM supply chain. 
 Earlier this year, Washington asked Seoul to restrict the flow of equipment and technologies for making high-end logic and memory chips to China, Bloomberg News reported. 
 Chinese companies can no longer buy the most advanced AI chips from Nvidia, but Huawei is developing its own AI accelerators, called Ascend. 
 It is unclear which company or companies are providing advanced memory chips to Huawei. 
 SK Hynix, Samsung and Micron all stopped supplying Huawei with chips after the US tightened sanctions against the Chinese company in 2020. 
 Washington officials have also grown worried about China’s own progress in chip making equipment. 
 Lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bipartisan bill to ban companies that receive US funding for chip factories from purchasing Chinese tools for those facilities.  — Bloomberg",washington senior american official visit japan country fresh restriction semiconductor sector ability memory chip artificial intelligence secretary commerce industry security estevez press counterpart hague limit activity dutch supplier japan tokyo electron people familiar matter estevez request dialogue ally chinese chip factory bandwidth memory chip people identified discussion private asml tokyo electron machine dynamic random access memory bandwidth memory hbm chip chinese company chip xinxin semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary china memory chipmaker yangtze memory technology corporate data provider qichacha huawei technology memory technology biden administration limit ability advanced semiconductor step national security mixed huawei advance support ally stringent control effective global blockade critical player global semiconductor equipment industry country matter gregory allen director centre technology strategic international study key provider equipment japan restriction export critical limitation technology estevez repeat request country restriction tokyo electron ability repair advanced equipment china people imposed restriction american rival material corp delegation visit netherlands dutch cabinet week july reinette klever lawmaker geert wilder party foreign trade development aid minister role country export control policy japanese government resisting pressure people familiar matter country time evaluate impact current export ban chip equipment presidential election uncertain dutch government wilder demand additional measure founder channel ongehoord nederland controversy pro russian reporting climate change scepticism foreign trade minister schreinemacher united week lobby asml dutch king willem alexander schreinemacher meeting york governor kathy hochul representative commerce department bureau industry security comment spokesperson foreign trade ministry comment japan economy trade industry ministry respond request hbm chip indispensable hardware ecosystem access memory development accelerator corp micro device hbm chip official conversation export chip bloomberg hynix producer hbm chip electronics micron technology catch hynix relies equipment tokyo electron bloomberg supply chain data south korean equipment maker hanmi semiconductor hanwha precision machinery play critical role hbm supply chain washington seoul restrict flow equipment technology memory chip bloomberg news chinese company advanced chip huawei accelerator unclear company company advanced memory chip hynix samsung micron huawei chip sanction chinese company washington official worried china progress chip equipment lawmaker bipartisan bill ban company chip factory chinese tool facility,"[(4, 0.9558981), (9, 0.041466646)]",4
694401,Main,12,17/06/2024,Can AI aid language learning?,,"THE use of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform teaching and learning processes, making them more efficient, personalised, and engaging.
 In language teaching and learning, there are many ways to utilise AI to enhance and improve the process of teaching and learning. However, with it comes sets of challenges and criticisms that must be taken into consideration.
 AI can make life easy in some ways, so much so that students may become overly reliant on it, hindering their ability to think critically and solve problems independently. This is where the role of the educator is crucial.
 We need to emphasise that AI is just a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional learning methods. We have to encourage students to use AI for idea-searching, practice, and feedback, and we must also engage them in activities that require critical thinking and human interaction, such as group discussions and debates.
 Using AI excessively might reduce face-to-face interaction and the development of interpersonal skills. Some students might be more comfortable using AI compared with having face-to-face brainstorming sessions and discussions. As educators, we need to balance AI-based activities with collaborative projects and classroom interactions. AI should be used to speed up some parts of teaching and learning activities so that the extra time can be used for more meaningful, interactive teaching moments rather than replacing human interaction.
 There is also the fact that AI-based programs can sometimes provide incorrect information, leading to misinformation being spread or students using wrong information in their work. As bad as this seems, it can actually be a teachable moment for our students. Aside from teaching students how to use AI in finding accurate information, we can also teach students to critically evaluate AI responses and cross-check information with reliable sources. This is a crucial skill for them not just in their studies but also in the world outside academia, especially in interacting with social media. We can also discuss the limitations of AI and the importance of recognising false information.
 Among the popular criticisms of the use of AI in language classrooms is that the interactions might be impersonal and less engaging compared with human interactions – ie “like talking to a robot” type of interactions. This is concerning, especially in language classrooms where authentic and genuine interactions are vital in developing students’ language abilities, especially listening and speaking skills.
 To mediate this, we should teach our students to use AI only for specific tasks where it excels, such as grammar checks or vocabulary practices, and reserve more personal and engaging activities, like discussions and debates, for human interaction.
 The integration of AI in education, including ESL (English as a Second Language) classrooms, presents significant opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning experiences. By proactively addressing the challenges AI brings and maintaining a balance between technology and human interaction, educators can utilise AI to create a more personalised, efficient, and engaging educational ecosystem.
 Our students are the students of this era; therefore, the old ways might prove less efficient for them. Educators nowadays have to be ready to change their ways for the better. There is no place to be stubborn and too hung up on the old ways and ideas in teaching and learning. As writer and futurist Alvin Toffler said, “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”

693691,StarBiz 7,5,15/06/2024,Can Generative AI unlock productivity and growth?,,"IF you watched Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang’s remarkable presentation at Taipei Computex last month, you would be convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new Industrial Revolution, in which accelerated computing with the latest AI chips unleashed the power of doing everything faster, more efficient with less energy.  
 In this age of intense global rivalry and competition, including military power, AI, robotics and improved engineering promises a techno-utopian way to achieve dominance over rivals.   
 McKinsey estimated that Generative AI’s impact on productivity could add between US$2.6 trillion and US$4.4 trillion to the global economy annually. That’s like adding one UK economy to the global economy every year.  
 Roughly three-fourths of productivity will come from business improvements in four areas – customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and research and development (R&D). 
 Think about it, instead of training everyone to learn coding, we bypass coding because AI can actually translate what you would like done through writing the script, creating the video, and even designing the process. Just ask ChatGPT’s latest version.  
 The machine has the answers, but ultimately it is the human being who will either execute what is needed, or just not do anything.  
 The reality is that even though Generative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors such as retail, banking, high tech and life sciences, whether the productivity (measured as output per capita) is achieved depends on how individuals, companies, communities and nations are driving the productivity change.   
 Since Generative AI changes the way we work by automating many individual activities, this is a social and political question. 
 Cross-border language barriers are removed when AI can do the automatic translation, print the transcript and even indicate the next work agenda.
 Since McKinsey estimates that current Generative AI and other technologies can automate work activities by as much as 60% to 70% of present employee time, no wonder many in the workforce fear AI adoption with huge resistance and reluctance to change.     
 The latest European Union (EU) Competitiveness and Industry Benchmarking Report 2024 indicates how at the high level, the EU realises that the region is racing against the clock as its industry has been continuously losing ground on global markets in terms of market share.
 EU companies are becoming less relevant and its future technological leadership is at risk. 
 The reason is obvious to all – EU’s market is much more fragmented than either the United States or China, being a collection of national markets rather than a single market with one currency, the euro. 
 The metrics speak for themselves. The EU’s share of global trade has fallen by one-third to second place (16% of global trade in 2021), compared with China (28.3%) and the United States (14.5%) since 2001. 
 In terms of market revenue of companies in Fortune Global 500, EU companies have fallen to third place between 2005 and 2023, whereas American companies lead with 31.8% and Chinese by 27.5%, while EU companies lag with 15.5%.  
 Europe’s adoption of 5G technology is way behind that of China or the United States.   
 Since R&D is a key driver of innovation and technological leadership, the EU has lagged with 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) spending by 2021, behind China (2.4%) and the United States (3.5%). This is particularly evident in industrial R&D investment amongst the world’s largest 2,500 companies. 
 The EU’s market share has fallen to third place of only 17.5%, overtaken by China (17.8%), whereas the United States leads with 42.1%. Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and engineering products (including industrial machinery) are already taking EU markets by storm. 
 Add to the fact that the EU’s energy costs are higher than that in the United States or China, and that EU regulations are the most complex relative to other markets, it is not surprising that EU companies have been shifting their production overseas.  
 Labour productivity has stagnated for years due to the highest social protection standards. As the report says, the EU’s regulatory environment needs an upgrade to empower and reward innovators, a reduction of EU and national regulatory silo-thinking, and enhancement of technology deployment with stronger public-private collaboration.  
 These European lessons are salutary for real sector transformation for almost all emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).  
 Despite being shocked by the global financial crisis of 2008, Europe has not undertaken structural reforms in the labour and corporate sectors to improve overall competitiveness.
 The financial sector, dominated by the fragmented banking system, remains risk-averse. German, French and Swiss banks are a shadow of their former global prowess, having been hit hard by tighter regulations and inept consolidations.
 The real issue is who drives the structural changes. In America, it is quite clear that the private corporate sector remains dynamic and committed to profits and innovation. In China, the government or party takes the lead, but allowed enough corporate competition that is aligned with national goals. No one pretends that American or Chinese corporations are neoliberal by inclination. 
 The EU and many EMDEs still suffer a schizophrenic tension between the old neoliberal aim of free markets, with newer liking for state intervention and industrial policies. The neoliberal approach failed where governments and the public think that just passing more laws and regulations would solve social and market ills.
 As we all have learnt from bitter experience, policies and programmes are easily frustrated at the legislative or political levels, or mired in forever legal suits by vested interests against change.  
 Eco-system change is complex and requires not only the construction of a common narrative of why you need change, but also concrete execution of visible projects that demonstrate determination and engender public trust. 
 If you want the economy to change, appoint business leaders who understand how to manage institutional change that remains business-friendly.   
 Indonesian president Jokowi’s appointment of former tech platform Gojek president Nadiem Makarim as Minister of Education is an example of how to shake a traditional educational bureaucracy towards technological eco-system change. Radical change needs radical thinking, but by someone like Jensen Huang who understands both the role of technology and markets.   
 The AI revolution is already happening at frightening speed.  Economies that mess up the transition will be marginalised.  Those companies and communities that adapt well will not only survive but thrive.  
 That is the cruelness of Darwinian competition.

693225,StarBiz,11,14/06/2024,"Oracle shares hit record high on AI, cloud growth",Revenue set for double-digit increase by next year,"NEW YORK: Oracle Corp is reporting better-than-expected bookings and announced partnership deals with tech rivals, giving a boost to chairman Larry Ellison’s effort to redefine the software maker as a major competitor in the business of cloud computing. The shares hit a record high.
 The company, known for its database software, is focused on expanding its cloud infrastructure unit – which rents computing power and storage – to compete with Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google. 
 While this division produces a small portion of total sales, investors view it as Oracle’s major future growth bet.
 Oracle shares gained 13% to close at a record US$140.38 Wednesday in New York, the biggest single-day increase since December 2021. The stock has jumped 33% this year.
 In the past two quarters, “Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history – driven by enormous demand for training artificial intelligence (AI) large language models in the Oracle Cloud,” chief executive officer Safra Catz said Tuesday in a statement.
 Revenue growth will increase by double digits in the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, fuelled by strong demand for AI workloads, Catz said.
 Growth should accelerate through the year as the cloud unit’s “capacity begins to catch up with demand”, she added.
 Oracle also announced a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. 
 A similar deal with Microsoft, which was announced in late 2023, “will turbocharge our cloud database growth”, Ellison said in a separate statement. 
 OpenAI, which has received billions in funding from Microsoft, will use Austin-based Oracle’s cloud infrastructure for “additional capacity”, the companies said in a statement. 
 Oracle’s cloud has developed a reputation for success with generative AI startups – the company touted customers including including Reka, MosaicML, and Elon Musk’s xAI. AI technology needs enormous computing power to work. 
 “The world’s largest cloud companies and the world’s most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle Cloud services and data centres,” Ellison said on a conference call after the company released its financial fourth-quarter results.
 The momentum in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business “is undeniable and the OpenAI announcement creates another positive data point in AI”, wrote Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI.
 Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana said the demand to run AI workloads in Oracle’s cloud computing data centres “could catapult it to become the fourth-largest cloud provider”.
 Catz said on the conference call that the cloud infrastructure unit will grow more than 50% in the current financial year.
 Oracle said that total remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted sales, increased 44% to US$98bil in the period ended May 31, far surpassing the average estimate of US$73.9bil.
 Revenue from the cloud unit that rents computing power and storage increased 42% to US$2bil, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected US$1.97bil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Total revenue gained 3.3% to US$14.3bil, compared with the US$14.6bil average estimate. Profit, excluding some items, was US$1.63 per share. Analysts expected US$1.65.
 Underwhelming results from peers like Salesforce Inc and Workday Inc in recent weeks have fuelled investor anxiety that technology budgets are being funnelled away from application software to AI tools. 
 Sales in Oracle’s cloud applications business, including its Fusion apps for corporate finance, increased 10% to US$3.3bil. 
 That’s a slowdown from the roughly 14% growth the unit has seen over recent quarters and below analysts’ estimates.
 The new partnerships are likely to accelerate growth in Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which could help offset a slowdown in applications, Rana wrote in a note after the earnings were released. — Bloomberg",york racle corp reporting booking partnership deal rival chairman larry ellison effort redefine software maker major competitor business cloud share record company database software cloud infrastructure unit power storage compete microsoft corp alphabet google division portion total sale investor major future growth oracle share record wednesday york biggest single day december stock quarter oracle largest sale contract history enormous demand artificial intelligence language model cloud chief executive officer safra catz tuesday statement revenue growth increase double digit current fiscal strong demand workload catz growth cloud unit capacity demand oracle agreement namesake database google cloud infrastructure deal late turbocharge cloud database growth separate statement openai billion microsoft austin oracle cloud infrastructure additional capacity company statement cloud developed reputation success generative startup company customer reka mosaicml elon musk xai technology enormous power largest cloud company successful company oracle cloud service data centre conference call company financial fourth quarter momentum oracle cloud infrastructure business undeniable openai announcement positive data kirk materne analyst isi bloomberg intelligence analyst rana demand workload cloud data centre fourth largest cloud provider catz conference call cloud infrastructure unit current financial oracle total performance obligation measure future sale bil period average estimate bil revenue unit rent power storage bil company statement analyst projected bil data bloomberg total revenue bil average estimate profit item share analyst underwhelming peer workday week investor anxiety technology budget application software tool sale cloud application business fusion corporate finance slowdown growth unit quarter analyst estimate partnership growth oracle cloud infrastructure business slowdown application note earnings bloomberg,"[(2, 0.4677286), (14, 0.52870333)]",14
693229,StarBiz,11,14/06/2024,Adobe results  to reveal scale  of threat from  AI competition,,"CHICAGO: Investors in Adobe Inc are increasingly on edge about competition from generative artificial intelligence (AI). 
 The Photoshop maker’s results will illustrate how it’s coping with the threat. 
 Earlier this week, Melius Research downgraded Adobe to “hold” from “buy”, citing risks from image and video generators from OpenAI and Alphabet Inc’s Google. 
 Adobe shares are down more than 20% this year as Wall Street considers its prospects in a world where AI products create text and images out of user prompts. 
 “Companies will pay for software that offers a clear return on investment, but it’s become less clear which services do if AI platforms can just offer a version of the product as a feature,” said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. 
 “Adobe is integrating AI into its own products, but AI images and video are becoming really good, really fast – and it could become a loser to the extent people stop spending on it and use AI instead.”
 On one hand, software companies focused on AI have performed well this year, including Microsoft Corp, Palantir Technologies Inc, and C3.ai Inc. 
 However, there have also been sell-offs from the likes of Salesforce Inc, Workday Inc, MongoDB Inc and UiPath Inc, which warned about weaker enterprise IT spending, a headwind that could also impact Adobe, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
 Adobe’s last report featured a weak outlook, underlining concerns about competition. 
 Consensus estimates for the company’s net full-year earnings are down 13% over the past three months, though the view for revenue has held steady.
 Since its mid-March report, the firm has worked to reassure investors. AI-related product announcements at its annual Summit conference were viewed positively, as was pricing information for its Acrobat AI Assistant services. 
 While that has failed to reverse the stock’s drop, bulls have other positives they can point to. 
 Yesterday’s report is expected to show 20% growth in net earnings, along with nearly 10% revenue growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 Full-year revenue is seen growing at a double-digit pace for the next few fiscal years, while free cash flow is expected to grow 13% this year before accelerating to nearly 25% next year.
 The stock trades at 24 times estimated earnings, a discount to its long-term average, and its recent weakness could mean a low bar to clear in the results. 
 More than 75% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while the average price target points to upside of 31%. — Bloomberg",chicago investor edge competition generative artificial intelligence photoshop maker illustrate threat week melius adobe hold risk image video generator google adobe share street considers prospect product text image prompt company software offer investment service platform version product feature sean sun portfolio manager investment management adobe product image loser extent people hand software company microsoft corp palantir technology offs salesforce workday uipath weaker enterprise spending headwind impact adobe bloomberg intelligence adobe report weak outlook underlining concern competition consensus company net earnings month revenue steady mid march report firm reassure investor product announcement annual summit conference acrobat assistant service reverse stock drop bull yesterday report growth net earnings revenue growth data bloomberg revenue double digit pace fiscal free cash flow grow stock trade earnings discount term average weakness low bar analyst bloomberg recommend stock average price target bloomberg,"[(2, 0.23075059), (4, 0.7626312)]",4
692901,StarBiz,14,13/06/2024,Morgan Stanley brings AI tools to Australia clients,Wall Street bank unveils more software Down Under,"SYDNEY: Morgan Stanley plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to manage rich people’s portfolios in Australia as the Wall Street bank roll outs more software in the country that’s used in other parts of the world.
 “Other regions are a little bit more established. It’s a real opportunity for us to bring some of the leading ideas we have learned from overseas markets to Australia,” Morgan Stanley’s head of wealth management for Australia, Rebecca Hill, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV yesterday in Sydney. 
 The decision comes as the value of high-net worth individuals in Australia rose about 8% last year and now exceeds US$1 trillion for first time, according to a Capgemini report last week. 
 Morgan Stanley in March appointed its first global head of AI as banks around the world seek to capitalise on potential cost savings. 
 “On the whole Australia is a more maturing market. We are starting to become more sophisticated as investors, but it’s still very early days,” Hill said, speaking on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit.
 As a result of such initiatives and overall growth in assets under management in line with a strong local economy, the firm has plans to add more headcount, Hill said. 
 She didn’t specify how many staff the wealth business might add.
 Morgan Stanley is already the largest global wealth management provider in Australia, with more than A$41bil (US$27bil) in client assets, according to its website. 
 The firm has more than 100 financial advisers in five branches across the country working with high net worth individuals, family offices and not-for-profits.
 Morgan Stanley chief executive officer Ted Pick earlier said AI could help its financial advisers save up to 15 hours a week. 
 The bank’s been beefing up its wealth operations in Asia-Pacific for years, after integrating the business with the firm’s institutional securities group. 
 Globally, the wealth business has been a star performer and cemented its increased importance by posting better-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. 
 The unit is just months into new leadership after Jed Finn was appointed to run the US$4.8 trillion business in November.
 Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s Australia chief Richard Wagner said the country is benefitting from an increase in capital flows that cements its ability to cushion investment risk during a period of global turbulence.
 “It’s very, very hard to lose money in Australia and therefore that safe haven has been an attraction of capital, particularly in the last 12 months as we’ve seen such extended volatility in China,” Wagner said in a Bloomberg TV interview yesterday. 
 “Most of the global money that’s been pointed at Asia-Pacific has been reweighted away from China. And the beneficiaries of that have been Australia, Japan and India.”
 Deal activity in Australia is improving month by month, Wagner said, with the bank expecting a pick up in activity as investors get more clarity on the trajectory of global interest rates and the US presidential election.
 “The rabbit hasn’t jumped out of the hat quite yet, but every month gets better,” he said, speaking to Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Morgan Stanley Australia Summit in Sydney. 
 That follows a “couple of tough years in investment banking”, he added. 
 Morgan Stanley’s Pick, who took over from Australian-born James Gorman at the start of this year, has pledged to keep meeting the firm’s goals in the wealth business while unlocking additional gains in investment banking. 
 In Australia, Morgan Stanley has nabbed a lead manager role on the initial public offering (IPO) of Mexican food chain Guzman y Gomez, the first large IPO in years, while advising troubled real-estate developer Lendlease Group on its breakup plans.
 Adding to Australia’s relative strength is an economy that Wagner – like Treasurer Jim Chalmers – is betting will not enter a recession, in part due to the windfall from the country’s resources export base and historically low unemployment. — Bloomberg",sydney morgan stanley plan artificial intelligence capability rich people portfolio wall street bank roll out software country region established real opportunity idea overseas market morgan stanley head wealth management hill interview bloomberg yesterday decision net worth individual exceeds time capgemini report week morgan stanley march global head bank capitalise potential cost saving market sophisticated investor day sideline morgan stanley australia result initiative growth asset management strong local economy firm headcount hill staff wealth business morgan largest global wealth management provider australia bil bil client asset website firm financial adviser branch country net worth individual family office profit stanley chief executive officer pick financial adviser hour week bank wealth operation pacific business firm institutional security business star performer revenue quarter unit month leadership jed finn business morgan stanley australia chief richard wagner country increase capital cement ability cushion investment risk period global turbulence hard lose money australia safe attraction capital month volatility china wagner bloomberg interview yesterday global money asia pacific china beneficiary japan india deal activity month month bank pick activity investor trajectory global rate presidential election rabbit month bloomberg sideline stanley australia summit sydney couple tough investment banking morgan stanley pick australian james gorman meeting firm wealth business additional gain investment banking australia lead manager role initial public offering ipo mexican food chain guzman ipo troubled real estate developer lendlease breakup plan australia relative strength economy wagner treasurer jim chalmers enter recession windfall country resource low unemployment bloomberg,"[(2, 0.99592257)]",2

692577,StarBiz,5,12/06/2024,"Generative AI set to shake up job market, create new opportunities",,"PETALING JAYA: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is set to replace or make some jobs obsolete, but it could also mean new job opportunities in other areas.
 Speakers in a forum organised by Star Media Group Bhd’s Leaders Council Power Breakfast yesterday said that there were pertinent concerns among the incoming workforce, who are mostly students now, about potential job losses from the wider adoption of generative AI, which is a much more advanced form of AI.The forum was titled “Shaping the Digital Future of Malaysia”.
 Fabian Bigar, chief executive officer of MyDigital Corp, a government agency under the Digital Ministry, said the advent of generative AI is similar to another industrial revolution which is likely to shake up the job market.
 The present sentiment towards AI appears to be more pessimistic with regards to potential job losses but Fabian noted there could be upside opportunities from this development. This was also echoed by other panelists at the forum.
 “AI has been there a long time, but the development of generative AI feels like there is a revolution, as within a short span of time things have been transformed. 
 “There is a change in how we interact with the rest of the world or machines and it can generate new things,” Bigar said. 
 “In the past AI needed to be trained and programmed to do specific tasks. Right now, with generative AI, it can come out with new things by itself. It is self-learning and is able to create new things. That’s why it’s important to fact-check as the system can ‘hallucinate’, but if it is fed with enough accurate information it can actually give a reliable output,” he added.
 Bigar cited previous technological developments, such as when automobiles became more widespread, which meant makers of horse-drawn carriages became obsolete. However, it also led to a new types of jobs such as mechanics and engineers.
 “Generative AI could mean the displacement of menial or repetitive jobs that can be done by the technology. But then to maintain these systems still requires human intervention and judgement. 
 IBM Asean’s general manager and group technology leader Catherine Lian said  that generative AI had already replaced jobs related to expense claims within the  group.
 “IBM has got about 450,000 employees globally. Jobs related to processing claims for things like travel expenses have been repurposed. We have taken away 5,000 such jobs worldwide as there is a 100% replacement here by generative AI at IBM. 
 “The jobs have been lost but the people have been repurposed to other roles such as marketing and human resources. A repetitive task is a 100% replaceable by generative AI,” Lian said.
 Meanwhile, Siemens Malaysia’s president and chief executive officer Tindaro Danze said it is quite likely jobs in computer programming or coding would become obsolete within the next ten years.
 “In 10 years from now, any person can programme a machine and coding is going to be obsolete,” Danze said.
 Generative AI could also change the way education is carried out eventually, said MyDigital’s Bigar.
 “The schooling experience may be a little bit different, I don’t think it will be about knowledge any more, but rather about asking the right questions,” he added.
 Pos Malaysia Bhd’s group chief executive Charles Brewer said he sees generative AI as an exciting development that’s anticipated to change many different parts of its business. “Generative AI is a huge opportunity and super exciting. We know of 642 use cases where it would add significant value to our employees, customers and business. On the flipside, we have to think of the jobs that would no longer exist, and we would need to reskill these people and create new business units,” Brewer told StarBiz.
 Danze said the situation in the job market and the impact of generative AI is still playing out, and is difficult to predict what new jobs or industries would come about.
 “Ten years ago, no one would’ve thought that ride hailing would be such a huge job market. As the application of new technologies increases, the opportunities of new jobs will increase at the same pace,” he said.

691875,Lifestyle,4,10/06/2024,AI in the workplace,"Though AI is transforming business  operations and marketing, it still struggles  with creative tasks and needs human  oversight to avoid errors.","ARTIFICIAL intelligence, or AI, is changing the way businesses operate, and its use is expected to only become more prevalent in the future.
 Ken Opremke, regional manager of Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania, said he’s seeing more and more business models that include the use of AI.
 Ben Franklin makes seed investments in early-stage technology companies, funds innovation in established manufacturers, and supports clients with in-house experts and a network of technical and business resources.
 “It’s not just about a cool technology, it’s about a useful tool that facilitates marketing and business efficiency,” Opremke said.
 Bethany Staples, executive creative director and CEO at Market Share Consulting in Olyphant, said that although she dabbled in using AI on a personal level when ChatGPT was released, she didn’t feel comfortable using it in her marketing and consulting business until late last year.
 “That was when I started recognising (the value in) the use of AI for repetitive tasks and things that I otherwise was spending a tonne of time doing that could just be easily done in half of the time by automating those things,” Staples said.
 But she doesn’t like AI for creative aspects of her work.
 “Traditionally, I think in the marketing world, people expect you to be using it for things like content creation or photoshopping certain things and all of that. Personally, I’m not there yet,” Staples said.
 She said AI-generated material seems obviously created by a robot.
 “So we’re very conscientious of that, especially in the marketing world when it comes to social media content creation or script writing for original content and things like that,” Staples said. “It feels very ob­­vious that a robot is talking to you and not a human, and I feel like it’s losing a human touch.”
 Cheating and hallucinations
 Recent AI technology is probably best known for its ability to do anything from write a term paper or newspaper article to create original images based on other images, depending on what a user asks.
 Using it to cheat at school is one concern voiced by many.
 Kim Pavlick, an associate professor in the communications and media department at the University of Scranton, has been delving into AI topics with her students for about three semesters.
 “The way I approach it is that I explain to students that it’s like a calculator. We use a calculator for math now, but our parents’ generation freaked out at that – how can you dare use a calculator for math? 
 “And now, people are freaking out about AI. It’s a tool. If you don’t know how to use the tool well, and you don’t know how to use the tool correctly, it’s not going to help you,” Pavlick said.
 She also cautions students about “hallucinations”, the phenomenon in which an AI large language model (LLM) creates false information by perceiving patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to human observers.
 Pavlick said AI can’t replace humans, who use critical thinking in their jobs. 
 “AI might not take your job, but someone who knows how to leverage AI may take your job,” she said.
 A spectrum of uses
 AI is also being used for many other things in business other than just content creation. It can be found in everything from auto repair and sales to manufacturing to medicine.
 “Our AI focus is on translating data science into clinical and operational practice,” David Vawdrey, chief data informatics officer at Geisinger, said via email.Vawdrey said Geisinger is exploring generative AI capabilities, but because of the risks and limitations associated with current AI tools, such as misinformation, bias and privacy concerns, it’s essential to have human experts in the loop.
 Like other healthcare systems, Geisinger will soon begin evaluating “ambient clinical documentation”, where, with the patient’s permission, generative AI is used to compose a draft of the doctor’s notes during a clinic encounter.
 “Doctors still have to review and edit the draft, but if the computer system can help reduce the paperwork burden, it will enable more time and attention for patients,” Vawdrey said.
 Blue-collar bots?
 David Centak, general mana­­ger of Subaru of Wyoming Valley in Plains Twp, Pennsylvania, said auto dealers can use AI chatbots to answer customers’ basic questions about autos for sale on a company’s website and create sales leads.
 It can also be used in diagnostics for engines and other auto systems, although Subaru of Wyoming Valley doesn’t yet use AI for those purposes.
 “But I’m almost certain it will be incorporated at some point in the future,” Centak said.
 Kevin Jones, co-owner and CEO of transmedia company VizVibe, located in the Luzerne Bank Building in downtown Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, said he’s using AI to assist with the company’s core focus: augmented reality for industrial solutions.
 VizVibe creates computer programs that, for example, would allow a supervisor to hand a tablet or smartphone to an assembly line worker who could view a piece of machinery on the screen using the camera, tap the screen displaying a part of the machinery, and then see text or video instructions overlayed on the screen on how to properly use or manipulate the component.
 “We’re working with AI for image recognition of those parts, for quicker recognition for the overlays of the content that give instructions for troubleshooting, service, maintenance, and that sort of thing with the machines and the assembly lines in manufacturing,” Jones said.
 “It keeps the production lines running quicker, it reduces downtime, it improves product flow, and that sort of thing,” he added. “And then, on the flip side, the employees on the line could use AI to report trouble spots, and AI learns where the trouble spots are, what it is that’s breaking down, and it’ll allow preventative maintenance to happen faster”.
 Jones said AI can also improve logistics production times because employers can use AI to generate reports right on the assembly line.
 “It can say, hey, this is where there’s a juggernaut, or this is where things get held up. And then we can use the information, the data from the AI, along with the AR overlays, again, to increase productivity,” Jones said.
 Historical companion
 AI and AR are also being used in the travel and tourism industry, Jones said.
 VizVibe has created a smartphone app for people taking the Walkitecture historic tour of Wilkes-Barre. This self-guided tour features 24 different stops, allowing users to capture images of historic buildings using the app. The app utilises AI to provide information about each building.
 The app can be further developed using AI to recognise questions about a building or person spoken into the smartphone and then display prerecorded videos of a period actor or historian addressing the question directly.Like Pavlick, Jones views AI as a tool.
 “In the long run, on the industry side of things, it’s probably going to replace people’s jobs because it’s going to make manufacturing and production and those things a lot more streamlined,” Jones said. 
 “But the jobs that are going to remain are going to be higher­­-paying jobs and more-refined jobs. So, I guess, in that aspect, it’s a double-edged sword.” – The Citizens’ Voice/Tribune News Service",artificial intelligence business prevalent future opremke regional manager ben franklin technology partner northeastern pennsylvania business model ben franklin seed investment stage technology company fund manufacturer client house expert network technical business resource technology tool business efficiency bethany staple creative director ceo market share olyphant personal level chatgpt feel comfortable marketing consulting business repetitive task tonne time half time staple creative aspect people content creation staple material robot conscientious marketing social medium content creation script original content staple feel vious robot human feel human touch cheating hallucination technology ability write term paper newspaper article original image image user cheat school concern kim pavlick associate professor communication medium department university scranton topic student semester explain student calculator math parent generation dare calculator math people tool tool tool pavlick caution student hallucination language model llm false pattern object nonexistent imperceptible human observer human critical thinking job job leverage job spectrum business content creation auto repair sale medicine focus data science clinical operational practice david vawdrey chief data informatics officer geisinger vawdrey geisinger generative capability limitation current tool misinformation privacy concern essential human expert healthcare system geisinger ambient clinical documentation patient permission generative compose draft doctor clinic encounter doctor edit draft computer system paperwork burden enable time attention patient vawdrey blue collar bot centak mana ger subaru valley plain pennsylvania auto dealer chatbots customer basic question auto sale company website create sale diagnostics engine auto system valley purpose future centak kevin jones owner transmedia company vizvibe luzerne bank downtown wilkes pennsylvania assist company core focus reality industrial solution computer program hand tablet smartphone worker view machinery screen camera tap screen machinery text video instruction screen manipulate component image recognition quicker recognition content instruction service maintenance sort machine line jones production line quicker reduces improves product flow sort flip employee report trouble spot trouble spot preventative maintenance faster jones logistics production time employer generate report juggernaut data productivity jones historical companion travel tourism industry jones smartphone app people historic tour wilkes tour feature user capture historic building app utilises building app recognise question person smartphone display video period actor historian question pavlick jones view tool industry people job production lot jones job job job sword voice tribune news service,"[(10, 0.9972854)]",10
691949,StarBiz,6,10/06/2024,Content Forum backs AI governance suggestion,"Curbing misuse in content creation, distribution crucial","PETALING JAYA: The Communications and Multimedia Content Forum of Malaysia (Content Forum) fully backs the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s (MCMC) suggestions for the regulatory measures needed to govern the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in content creation and distribution.
 This came after MCMC member Derek John Fernandez’s recent recommendations regarding the urgent need for regulatory measures to govern the use of AI in content creation and distribution.
 Fernandez highlighted the critical importance of curbing the misuse of AI technologies, such as deepfakes, which can significantly threaten public peace and national security. 
 He emphasised the necessity for a regulatory framework that mandates clear disclosure when images or videos are generated by AI, thereby preventing the spread of misinformation and protecting individuals from becoming victims of online fraud.
 Content Forum CEO Mediha Mahmood said the regulatory body aligns with these recommendations, recognising that they are in perfect harmony with its mission to advocate the self-regulation of content within Malaysia’s digital space, as outlined in the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code 2022 (Code). 
 This Code highlights the importance of transparency, already requiring disclosures when influencers are used for marketing purposes. 
 Extending these principles to include AI-generated content will further strengthen consumer trust and protect the community from misleading information.
 Content Forum is an independent self-regulatory body registered under the MCMC as an industry forum designated by the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 to oversee and promote self-regulation of content over the electronic networked medium.
 Meanwhile, Content Forum chairman Rafiq Razali emphasised the collective responsibility in ensuring the safe use of AI in content creation, stating: “AI has immense potential to revolutionise the content industry, driving unprecedented levels of creativity and efficiency.
 “Yet, this potential must be managed with careful consideration. It is imperative that the lawmakers, AI service providers, regulators and content creators work collaboratively to allocate sufficient resources and ensure these technologies are used responsibly. 
 “Prioritising user safety and maintaining the integrity of digital content are crucial to fostering a trustworthy content environment,” he said.
 Mediha said recent incidents where deepfake videos featuring well-known public figures went viral had caused widespread confusion within the community. 
 Furthermore, there are cases where AI-generated content has been used to scam the unsuspecting public with highly believable content. These incidents are a stark reminder of how easily AI can be misused to manipulate information and deceive the public, she noted.
 By implementing regulations like mandating the disclosure of AI-generated content, she said it is possible to mitigate these risks and safeguard the community from digital deception.
 Mediha added: “When the Internet was first introduced, we could not anticipate the full range of challenges that would arise, from cyberbullying to misinformation. 
 “These issues continue to evolve and Malaysia remains committed to addressing them through effective legislation and regulation.
 “As we stand on the brink of widespread AI adoption, we must learn from past experiences.”
 Mediha emphasised that pre-empting potential harms through swift and effective regulation is not just prudent, but is also essential.
 “The Content Forum is confident that by taking proactive measures, we can fully harness the transformative benefits of AI, while maintaining a safe and secure digital landscape. 
 “It encourages all stakeholders within the digital content ecosystem to work together in developing robust regulatory frameworks that protect user interests and promote innovation,” Mediha noted.
 As an industry self-regulatory body, the Content Forum comprises key members of the communications and multimedia content industry, including broadcasters, advertisers, content creators, Internet access service providers and civic groups. 
 This dynamic and robust representation of industry practitioners ensures that content standards continue to be developed with the objective of establishing a level playing field in the industry.
 It is also responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Content Code (Content Code). The Content Code was prepared by the Content Forum and first registered with MCMC on Sept 1, 2004, with a revamp in 2022. 
 The Content Code is the principal source for industry self-regulation as it contains governing standards and best practices for content dissemination within the communications and multimedia industry in Malaysia. 
 The main objective of the Content Code is to outline procedures of self-regulation that provides the platform for creativity, innovation and healthy growth of a fast-evolving industry.",jaya communication content forum malaysia content forum malaysian communication commission mcmc suggestion regulatory measure artificial intelligence content creation distribution mcmc derek john fernandez recommendation urgent regulatory measure content creation distribution fernandez critical curbing misuse technology threaten public peace national security necessity regulatory framework mandate disclosure spread misinformation individual victim fraud content forum ceo mediha mahmood regulatory body aligns recommendation perfect harmony mission advocate regulation content malaysia digital space malaysian communication content code code code highlight transparency disclosure influencers purpose principle content strengthen consumer trust community misleading content forum independent regulatory body mcmc industry forum communication oversee promote regulation content electronic networked medium content forum chairman rafiq razali collective responsibility safe content creation immense potential revolutionise content industry unprecedented level creativity efficiency potential careful consideration imperative lawmaker service provider regulator content creator sufficient resource technology user safety integrity digital content crucial fostering trustworthy content environment mediha incident video public figure viral widespread confusion community content scam public believable content incident stark manipulate deceive public implementing regulation disclosure content mitigate risk community digital deception mediha internet anticipate range challenge misinformation issue malaysia committed effective legislation regulation brink widespread adoption learn experience pre potential harm effective regulation prudent essential content forum confident proactive measure transformative benefit safe secure digital landscape stakeholder digital content ecosystem robust regulatory framework user promote innovation mediha industry regulatory body content forum comprises key communication content industry broadcaster advertiser content creator internet access service provider dynamic robust representation industry practitioner content standard objective level field industry responsible implementation enforcement malaysian communication content code content code content code content forum mcmc sept revamp content code principal source industry regulation standard practice content dissemination communication industry malaysia main objective content code outline procedure platform creativity innovation healthy growth industry,"[(4, 0.9967348)]",4
691469,Main,23,08/06/2024,Old cats feel paw-sitive effects of AI healthcare,,"AS the use of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to benefit the health sector, cats are also feeling its paw-sitive effects.
 Some Tokyo-based startups are looking to keep the country’s cats in the pink of health, tapping AI to do so, Nikkei Asia reported.
 Rabo, a company that develops technology for pet owners, offers a smart collar for owners to track what their cats are up to. 
 The Catlog collar tracks inputs such as a cat’s routine, appetite, behaviour and provides a health analysis using AI. This allows owners to be alerted of potential issues.
 A sleep tracking feature will also be rolled out in June, where AI will be used to compare a cat’s data against medical histories of 30,000 other felines.
 CEO Yukiko Iyo told Nikkei Asia that Rabo aims to help cats stay with their owners for as long as possible, even as Japan’s cats – much like its human population – continue to grow older.
 A guideline published by Japan’s Environment Ministry showed that the country’s cats are living longer, with the average lifespan reaching a record 15.79 years in 2023 – roughly equivalent to the human age of 79.
 However, since cats normally hide their discomfort and mask any health issues, nipping health problems in the bud can be challenging.
 Tech firm Carelogy has deve­loped an app that can tell owners when their cats are in pain. 
 This is done by teaching AI how to identify five signs of discomfort in cats, such as ears that are pulled apart or muscles that are tensed.
 A survey by the Japan Pet Food Association in 2023 showed that about 60% of cat owners had taken their pets to the vet in the past year just once, or not at all.
 There were about 9.06 million pet cats in Japan in 2023, with a representative from the Japan Pet Food Association noting that demand for pets grew during the Covid-19 pandemic.

691003,StarBiz,10,07/06/2024,Telecoms player TeleAI surmounts dialect challenge,,"BEIJING: In a groundbreaking development, TeleAI, the artificial intelligence (AI) research division of China Telecom, has unveiled the industry’s first advanced speech recognition model capable of understanding and processing over 30 Chinese dialects.
 This large language model (LLM), known as Xingchen in Chinese, addresses a significant barrier in customer service, where millions of daily calls, especially from elderly users in remote regions, are made in local dialects that traditional AI systems and customer service representatives struggle to understand.
 With approximately 20% of China’s population not fluent in spoken Mandarin Chinese, this advancement aims to bridge the communication gap, ensuring equitable access to digital services for all, China Telecom said.
 TeleAI has tackled the challenge of creating an LLM that breaks away from conventional approaches, which typically limit recognition to a single dialect.
 By incorporating Cantonese, Shanghainese, Sichuanese and Wenzhounese, among others, the Xingchen model marks a significant leap forward in natural language processing technology, China Telecom said.
 This is particularly crucial for elderly residents and those in less-developed regions, who rely heavily on their native dialects for communication, the company added.
 Traditionally, dialect research has been a labour-intensive process, reliant on subjective human assessment and annotation, making comprehensive documentation difficult.
 AI, with its ability to systematically and efficiently catalogue and analyse linguistic data, offers a transformative solution. 
 TeleAI said it has already amassed a database exceeding 30,000 hours of high-quality dialect speech, positioning itself as a leader in this field.
 The Xingchen speech recognition model is currently being piloted across several regions.

690879,StarBiz,11,05/06/2024,Nvidia and AMD square off in fight to take control of AI adoption,,"NEW YORK: Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s (AMD) chiefs showcased new generations of the chips powering the global boom in artificial intelligence (AI) development, deepening a rivalry that’s shaping the future of AI design and adoption.
 Jensen Huang and Lisa Su, both born in Taiwan and now local celebrities for leading US tech powerhouses, employed different tacks in conveying their expertise during back-to-back shows at the world’s largest computing conference this week in Taipei. 
 Nvidia’s chief executive officer (CEO) repeatedly voiced his US$2.8 trillion company’s dominance in the accelerators that OpenAI and Microsoft Corp rely on to build generative AI services like ChatGPT. 
 Huang went as far as to tease a chip envisioned for 2026 he dubbed Rubin – after Vera Rubin, the American woman who helped discover dark matter. 
 The chip, which will succeed the Blackwell family, will be key to sustaining its runaway leadership. 
 While Huang headlined much of his own two-hour presentation on Sunday, AMD’s Su chose to make hers more of a team effort. 
 She brought out a stream of big-name partners from HP Inc CEO Enrique Lores to Lenovo Group Ltd’s Luca Rossi to convey the company’s focus on designing neural processors – a type of chip that runs AI services directly from laptops. 
 During her Computex address, Asustek Computer Inc chairman Jonney Shih called her “the pride of Taiwan” – a characterisation often associated with Huang of Nvidia, whose market valuation is now about 10 times that of AMD’s.
 “People see Nvidia as a personification of Jensen. And while Lisa is the saviour of AMD, she’s very clear that it’s about everyone around her,” said Ian Cutress, chief analyst at the consultancy More Than Moore. “AMD still have that underdog element about the business, and with AI it’s very much true.”
 The back-to-back presentations, attended by hundreds and watched by thousands more across the globe, underscored the growing stakes in a technology that has the potential to redefine a slew of industries and create new devices that can near-instantly generate video and other content from simple commands. 
 There’s a personal component to the competition too. 
 Su and Huang are not only both Taiwanese, they were born in the same city of roughly 1.8 million on Taiwan’s southern coast and are distant relatives. 
 That hasn’t made either one more willing to cede ground to the other.
 Su was originally tapped by organisers to kick off the week-long conference, one of the most important summits for tech executives around the world. 
 Instead, the Nvidia CEO organised his own presentation the Sunday night before the gathering’s official opening to talk about the chip maker’s strategic plans. 
 Huang, who had keynote Computex a year earlier, spoke at National Taiwan University just hours before the conference opened, essentially stealing the spotlight from his closest competitor. 
 AMD’s Su on Monday referred obliquely to the episode during an OpenAI demo of a chatbot.
 “Let’s start by letting the tool know that we’re interested in Taiwan, and that we’re going to be attending Computex,” Su said. 
 “And you might ask something about the opening keynote,” she quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.
 Nvidia sees the rise of generative AI as a new industrial revolution and expects to play a major role as the technology shifts to personal computers, the CEO said in his keynote address at National Taiwan University. 
 He returned to themes he set out a year ago at the same venue, including the idea that those without AI capabilities will be left behind.
 Delegates to Computex remarked that Huang’s performance drove home Nvidia’s continued dominance – a position that appeared difficult for AMD or any other rival to shake in the short run. 
 One fund manager told Bloomberg News that Huang generated a lot of buzz in particular around Rubin, even though the CEO didn’t go into detail about a chip slated for 2026.
 Shares of Nvidia rose 4.9% in New York on Monday, leaving them up 132% this year. AMD declined 2%.  
 Nvidia is selling customers a fully proprietary system, where businesses can buy its chips, networking gear and everything else required to run advanced AI development in data centres he’s called “AI factories”. 
 AMD, on the other hand, touts open standards that make its hardware interoperable with that of rivals like Intel Corp.

 The MI325X will go on sale in the fourth quarter, chief executive officer Lisa Su said in the opening keynote address of the Computex conference in Taiwan. 
 That chip, the successor to the MI300, will feature more memory and faster data throughput, the company said. MI350 will follow in 2025 and the MI400 model a year after that. 
 The move to a roughly annual release cycle matches Nvidia’s plans, set out by chief executive Jensen Huang in a speech the night before in Taipei.
 AMD is among the companies rushing to market with new products aimed at tapping the flood of cash being poured into new AI training systems, money that’s currently mainly being spent on Nvidia’s offerings. 
 Su said the company is still getting strong demand for its existing MI300 products and its new models will compare favourably with rival offerings.
 Santa Clara-based AMD has shown the most progress among the group chasing Nvidia. AMD has increased its sales target for so-called AI accelerators to US$4bil this year. That rapid increase from next to nothing last year still pales in comparison with Nvidia. 
 Nvidia’s data centre unit alone is on course to have annual sales that will exceed US$100bil, according to estimates, topping AMD and Intel Corp’s combined total annual revenue.
 For consumers, AMD talked about its third-generation Ryzen AI processors, dubbed Strix Point and going on sale from July. 
 Those are tailored for laptops and combine RDNA 3.5 mobile graphics, XDNA 2 neural processing units for accelerating AI tasks, and the latest Zen 5 processing cores. 
 Su invited a succession of partners out on stage – from HP Inc chief executive Enrique Lores and Lenovo Group Ltd executive vice-president Luca Rossi to Asustek Computer Inc chairman Jonney Shih – to discuss upcoming machines featuring AMD’s new Ryzen platform.
 AMD showed a slide suggesting the latest Ryzen system performs better with AI tasks than Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon X Elite, the chip that will feature heavily at Computex at the heart of Microsoft Corp’s new Copilot+ PCs. 
 Microsoft’s Windows chief Pavan Davuluri also joined Su on stage to say his team “have collaborated with AMD since day one” on the Copilot PC+ project.
 “On-device AI really for us means faster response times, better privacy and cost,” Davuluri said. “But that means running models that have billions of parameters in them on PC hardware.

689445,StarBiz,16,04/06/2024,Dell expects demand for its AI servers to continue,Company raises revenue outlook to US$98bil for FY25,"NEW YORK: Dell Technologies Inc fell the most since it returned to the public market in 2018 after its first revenue increase since 2022 wasn’t enough to impress investors with high expectations for the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) server business. 
 Sales increased 6.3% to US$22.2bil in the period ended May 3, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said in a statement. 
 Analysts, on average, estimated US$21.6bil. Profit, excluding some items, was US$1.27 a share, compared with the average projection of US$1.23.
 Revenue from Dell’s powerful servers equipped to handle AI tasks more than doubled from the previous quarter to US$1.7bil, chief operating officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement. 
 The backlog for those machines increased more than 30% quarter-on-quarter to US$3.8bil, he added.
 But excitement around AI demand for Dell’s machines created high expectations for last Thursday’s results. 
 The shares dropped 18% to US$139.56 at the close of last Friday in New York, the biggest single-day decline since Dell again became a public company in December 2018. 
 Dell’s stock had more than tripled over the past 12 months as investors have viewed the hardware maker as a beneficiary of demand for AI. 
 Large corporations increasingly need high-powered servers to train and run demanding generative AI tasks, which are sold by Dell and a few other companies.
 “Relative to very high expectations, Dell’s 2025 first quarter results were disappointing,” Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, wrote. 
 He pointed out that a decrease in adjusted operating margin in the quarter resurfaced “concerns that AI servers are being sold at near-zero margins”. 
 Dell expects the momentum from AI demand will continue through the year, chief financial officer Yvonne McGill said on a conference call after the results were released.
 The company raised its revenue outlook for the financial year ending in February 2025 to a range of US$93.5bil to US$97.5bil, an 8% increase at the mid-point, which would top analysts’ average estimates of a 7% gain. 
 Adjusted profit will be about US$7.65 a share, compared with the US$7.70 average estimate.
 Still, that outlook implies relatively flat AI server sales through the rest of the year, which “will cast some doubt on near-term competitiveness”, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Woo Jin Ho. 
 For its better-known business of selling personal computers (PCs), Dell reported US$12bil in revenue, little changed from the same period a year earlier. 
 Sales of business PCs increased 3% to US$10.2bil, surprising analysts who expected a 2% drop.
 The PC market had seen a historic decline over the last two years after many consumers, businesses and schools purchased laptops in the early months of the pandemic. 
 In the first quarter, shipments picked up 1.5% – the first increase since the end of 2021 – industry analyst IDC said in April. 
 PC-makers have been hopeful that those numbers signalled the end of the slump and that growth would accelerate in 2024 with the launch of machines equipped with a new version of Microsoft Corp’s Windows software as well as hardware equipped with chips to handle new artificial intelligence tools.
 Dell’s primary PC competitor, HP Inc, reported signs of a recovering computer market last Wednesday, sending its shares up 17% the next day. 
 Like Dell, HP reported a bump in sales among its business customers rather than consumers.

689699,Lifestyle,12,04/06/2024,The AI encounter,"While on a scenic tour of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, this writer ‘exchanged’ some words with an AI.","MY first encounter with Artificial Intelligence was both hilarious and hugely embarrassing. It happened in China recently, while on a tour of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
 My wife and I checked into a hotel in a little-known city called Hezhou on the scenic journey to Guilin covering five cities: Hezhou, Liuzhou, Loong Shan, Guilin and Yangshuo, each famous for its unique and dramatic landscapes.
 After collecting my room key, I was told that all electrical gadgets and components in the room were AI-operated. “Just call Xiao Tu to do it and it will respond,” the front desk girl told me cheerfully.
 Trundling our luggage to our room with great anticipation, I intended to ask AI’s help to first turn on the air-conditioner, and then to open the window curtains to get the view outside.
 After inserting the room card in its slot, I went to the air-conditioner controller on the wall and, in my best Malaysian Mandarin, commanded, “Xiao Tu, turn on the air-conditioner.” No response.
 I repeated the instructions several times without getting any result. I thought perhaps I needed to establish some sort of rapport with Xiao Tu first, or even with some pleading for help. But then, it was just a robot, not human, so I perished the thought. 
 I tried again. “Xiao Tu, draw open the curtains.” Nothing happened.
 In desperation, I went to the four corners of the room calling out to Xiao Tu with the same commands.
 Only once, by sheer chance, she responded. She told me to re-phrase my sentence as she could not understand my “brand” of Mandarin. It was hugely embarrassing to say the least. By that time, my wife was already rolling on the bed splitting her sides laughing at the comedy before her.
 I finally admitted defeat and called the front desk for help. When the handyman came, I realised that I had been calling out the wrong name. The AI’s name was “Xiao Du”. I called out again and it worked! A very sweet voice responded, “Wo zai” meaning, “I am here.”
 I also learned that the AI device was a black circular thing sitting next to the TV set.
 My friends who were more tech-savvy were having a whale of a time interacting with the sweet voice in that black box (yes, I know I sound like sour grapes), so much so that they actually missed Xiao Du when they returned to Kuala Lumpur.
 Later, I realised that in Mandarin, Xiao Tu means little rabbit while Xiao Du means little navigator. Obviously, I did not need a rabbit then.
 But back to our travels. Guangxi, to the west of Guang-dong Province, is famous for its rivers and mountains – a journey to Guilin and nearby Yangshuo is like walking into a Chinese landscape painting.
 The most memorable part of our tour was the two days we spent in a homestay in Ping’an, a Zhuang mountain village in Loong Sheng County famous for its rice terraces on Loongji Shan, which means “spine of the dragon”.
 It was a pity that we went in late spring. In winter, we would be able to see snow covering the rice terraces while in autumn, the padi fields would look like a blanket of gold.
 Nevertheless, what we missed out on was compensated by our very hospitable and friendly lady host who guided us around and whose husband cooked for us during our stay. 
 They are from the Zhuang tribe, a minority in Guangxi. They shared with us stories of their lifestyle, livelihood and living environment. They seemed to be a happy lot, very positive and very helpful.
 They reared their own chicken, bought fish from a neighbour who owned a pond, harvested vegetables from their own yards and grew “luo han guo”, a fruit well known to many Malaysians. It is a self-sufficient community indeed.
 The rice terraces were carved into the hill slopes during the Yuan Dynasty and completed in the Qing Dynasty about 700 to 800 years ago by the Zhuang people, who were driven uphill by the fearsome Miao tribe.
 The place has become a huge tourist attraction in the region. Our lady host took some of our younger friends up the hill to savour the panoramic view of the landscape. My wife and I, who were lacking the leg power, were contented just soaking up the view at mid-hill level.
 When the sun set and skies turned a midnight blue, the terraces became somewhat magical when small lights were turned on all over the hills. It was amazing!
 Of course, any tourist to Guangxi would not want to skip Guilin which is more famous than the capital city of Nanning because of its unique and picturesque landscapes. 
 Guilin is surrounded by mountains and rivers but the draw is the two lakes on which the twin Sun and Moon pagodas stand. Also known as the Gold and Silver pagodas, they cast a dreamy spell with their reflections teasing the rippling water.
 We saw huge crowds gathered on the lake side jostling for the best spot to shoot pictures and make videos, and it was not even peak tourist season yet.
 We covered five cities during our tour. In those cities we noticed that besides cars, the streets were jam-packed with e-bikes. There were hardly any bicycles seen, unlike about a decade ago when they were still the top mode of transportation. 
 The city skylines were dominated by high-rise apartments and office buildings, while the morning and night markets were crowded and vibrant.
 The streets are clean and orderly, too, lined with all sorts of eateries offering local cuisine and shops well stocked with daily necessities.
 Inter-city expressways are dotted with modern highway stops with stalls selling pancakes, tea-leaf eggs and snacks such as stewed duck necks, duck tongues and feet, which are local favourites. 
 Toilets are very clean and I dare say it is a gigantic improvement over the days when umbrellas were a handy tool.
 To me, these are concrete evidence of China’s success story of poverty-eradication, bringing progress and modernisation to what used to be a poor and backward region.

688799,Main,17,02/06/2024,Maxims for      the AI Age,LinkedIn  co-founder offers six principles to guide our thinking about the technology’s potential risks and rewards.,"DEBATES about technology have increasingly been reduced to stark dichotomies. Artificial intelligence should be curtailed, or it should be accelerated: thesis and antithesis, but no synthesis. Rather than picking a side, we should consider alternative rallying cries that place the focus where it belongs: humanity. 
 To that end, I propose six maxims. The first is a famous quip from the Carthaginian general Hannibal: “I shall either find a way or make one.” With AI still at a very early stage, we have barely scratched the surface of its potential. AI can help us find paths that we couldn’t see before, and it can help us make new ones through the force of human creativity. Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Pi are trained on material by and about people. Far from replacing us, they extend us. 
 Imagine finding a previously indiscernible thread of insight that runs through Gödel, Escher, Bach, Caravaggio, Rousseau, and Vivaldi; or a thread tying together the ingredients you just happen to have in your kitchen. A vast collection of human creation and past contributions hangs before us like an expanding tapestry, and we now have the tools to do more with it than any previous generation ever could.
 The second maxim is: “We are symbols, and inhabit symbols.” That is how Ralph Waldo Emerson described our use of language to comprehend, explain, and shape the world. We humans have always relied on tools, and that is what symbols are. They enable us to create things that did not exist before and do not occur naturally. Consider the griffin, with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. It is a human creation that reflects some reality we want to see in the world. Humans created griffins for uniquely human reasons. AI is no different.
 True, many imaginative creations – from Mary Shelley’s monster in Frankenstein to James Cameron’s killer cyborg in Terminator – are meant to be cautionary. We naturally feel fear when initially encountering “the other” or “the new.” But the griffin reminds us that we can convert fear into a sense of majestic possibility. Ultimately, humans are both the creators and the products of their symbols, culture, environment, and decisions. Together with AI, we can create more griffins. 
 The third maxim is to build cathedrals, as these ennoble our efforts and turn mere groupings of humanity into fellowships. Actual cathedrals are some of humankind’s most awe-inspiring creations, making it only fitting that we now refer to missions like the Apollo moon landing as “cathedral projects.” How great would it be if these were as much a part of our everyday lives as cathedrals are in European cities?
 Such projects require many sets of hands, working in concert across regions, disciplines, and sometimes even generations. As the writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, “A cathedral is built with stones; it is made up of stones; but the cathedral ennobles each stone, which becomes a cathedral stone.” Scientific discoveries and technological innovations are stones in the cathedral of human progress.
 The stories of the telescope, the radio, the car, the elevator, the airplane, and – now – AI follow a similar pattern. While many know AI through recent commercial applications like ChatGPT, it took generations of innovators and inventions to get us to this point. We need grand projects – born of both cooperation but also some healthy competition – to give us a sense of direction. How we design and build our cathedrals tells us who we are, and who we want to be.
 The fourth maxim is that we must take small risks to have any hope of navigating the big ones. Rather than trying to eliminate risk altogether – which is impossible – we ought to welcome challenges that could bring failure, because these create opportunities for iteration, reflection, discussion, and continual improvement.
 Recall the economist Hyman Minsky’s great insight about financial crashes. He saw that “stability” can create its own form of instability. Too many safeguards in a financial system can make it more brittle, and the appearance of safety means that nobody will be prepared when it breaks.
 The same lesson applies to AI regulation. Not only should we incentivise innovation; we should recognise that experimentation – taking smaller risks – is itself a risk-mitigation mechanism. Ultimately, we will get better regulation when these technologies have been deployed widely, allowing more people to try them out and integrate them into their lives. This, too, will be a shared undertaking, involving government, the private sector, the press, academia, the public – all of us.
 The fifth maxim is that technology is what makes us human. If we buy into the notion that AI is the antithesis to humankind’s thesis, we will anticipate a future of half-human, half-machine cyborgs. But that is not really how it works. The combination of thesis and antithesis leads not to a crude mashup, but to a new thesis. The two evolve together, and the resulting synthesis, in this case, is a better human.
 Moreover, AI may help us become more humane. Consider how responsive, present, and patient conversational AI models and chatbots can be. These features could have a profound impact on us. Not everyone has reliable access to human kindness and support. But when such resources become readily available, that will improve many people’s own capacities for kindness and empathy. And empathy can beget empathy. I think this dimension of AI’s potential has yet to be fully appreciated.
 The sixth and final maxim is that we have an obligation to make the future better than the present. Imagine a personalised digital doctor or tutor in everyone’s pocket. What are the costs of that happening later, rather than sooner? Speed is a virtue when it comes to technology, given its unrivalled power to improve lives.
 Everyone should ask themselves what a promising synthesis might look like. What if we can usher in a new era of human flourishing, where AI-driven research helps us discover new cures and harness the power of nuclear fusion in time to avert the worst consequences of climate change? It’s only natural to peer into the dark unknown and consider all that could go wrong. But it is necessary – and more essentially human – to consider what could possibly go right. — Project Syndicate

 Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the passing of the bill was important to the industry, as it protects and enhances the nation’s cyber security through compliance with specific measures, standards and processes in managing cyber security threats.
 “However, I do admit that we are just building the infrastructure on artificial intelligence (AI), so I think we need time to compete with Singapore. 
 “But it has resulted positively, for example in the case of Microsoft, because that was one of the concerns raised before they (Microsoft) made their investment announcement (US$2.2bil investment in Malaysia’s cloud and AI transformation),” he said at a media briefing here on the National Semiconductor Strategy yesterday.

686215,StarBiz,11,28/05/2024,Startups to play major role in AI landscape,Govt sets goal for country to be a leader in field,"HANOI: The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the startup scene around the world, including Vietnam. 
 AI took centre stage for the first time in history during the recent World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland in January, becoming one of the hot topics alongside issues like security, employment and climate change. 
 Within the vast realm of AI, generative AI (GenAI) stole the spotlight, showcasing the ability to simulate human intelligence and generate new content. 
 The technology is set to revolutionise human behaviour, impacting work, learning, entertainment and artistic creativity in profound ways.
 In Vietnam, AI is booming and becoming a pivotal technology in the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). 
 At the beginning of 2021, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh issued the National Strategy for Research, Development and Application of AI until 2030, aiming to make Vietnam a leader in Asean and establish 10 reputable AI brands by 2030. 
 This has attracted investment from both tech giants and innovative startups, creating new opportunities for groundbreaking projects and business models.
 Kai Yong Kang, business development manager for startups at Amazon Web Services, said that 2024 will be known as the “Year Of Products”. 
 Integration and AI use will become a widespread topic, extending beyond foundation models to encompass technologies like vector databases and orchestration engines.
 There is a mass inflow of investment in GenAI startups in top technology hubs like Silicon Valley and Europe, said Vy Le, chief executive officer of Do Ventures. 
 However, the rapidly evolving AI market should also be approached with caution in terms of partnerships. It is common for investment funds to make small initial investments or wait for technology maturity. 
 Key factors to evaluate AI start-ups include competitive advantage, revenue model and the team behind it, Vy added. 
 Laura Nguyen, a partner at GenAI Fund, stressed that the top concern for investment funds is to ensure the sustainability of GenAI startup business models. 
 This is particularly important in the presence of tech giants like Google and Microsoft, who have access to massive amounts of data. 
 She also highlighted the need for GenAI entrepreneurs to protect their businesses from market risks while fostering innovation and creativity.
 Experts are sharing optimistic insights on the progress of AI in Vietnam as technology companies make big investments. 
 Many university students are now GenAI founders and have already developed products that generate substantial revenues.
 Vietnam’s start-up ecosystem has progressed remarkably in recent years. 
 Experts highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment and infrastructure for startup development. 
 With a stable economy, a fast-growing ecosystem, a favourable startup environment, low costs and support from government policies and large corporations, AI startups are flourishing. 
 Vy from Do Ventures noted the benefits of collaborations between GenAI founders and major corporations, which provide extensive systems and data. And Vietnamese corporations have policies to foster partnerships with startups.
 Though the United States and China have a technological infrastructure advantage in AI, Vietnam can still compete in application development. 
 Valerie Vu, founder of Ansible Ventures, believes in the country’s talented engineers’ potential to create impactful AI applications.

686261,Main,14,28/05/2024,Beware of deceptive claims in AI industry,,"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) has been heralded as a transformative force that would revolutionise industries and drive unprecedented innovation. 
 But amid the enthusiasm, a trend known as “AI washing” has emerged. This practice involves companies overstating or misrepresenting the AI capabilities of their products or services, leading to potential deception. 
 AI washing is reminiscent of “greenwashing” from the early 2000s, where companies exaggerated their environmental efforts to attract environmentally conscious consumers. 
 In AI washing, companies often use ambiguous language and buzzwords like “intelligent”, “smart” or “AI-enhanced” without providing clear explanations or evidence of their products’ AI capabilities. 
 This deceptive marketing strategy not only misleads consumers but also distorts the competitive landscape, disadvantaging businesses that genuinely invest in AI research and development. 
 As consumers and businesses encounter more instances of AI washing, their trust in AI solutions diminishes. This can hold back the adoption of legitimate AI technologies. 
 Investors may also be misled into funding projects with overstated AI claims, thus diverting resources away from genuine innovations.
 AI washing could also affect  the regulatory landscape. Regulators could face difficulties in distinguishing between legitimate and deceptive AI claims, making it harder to establish effective policies and guidelines to govern AI deployment.
 A recent high-profile case that exemplifies the dangers of AI washing is the Rabbit R1 device. Marketed as a revolutionary AI-powered personal assistant, it promised unprecedented levels of interaction and automation. However, investigations revealed that the device’s functions were just basic automation. 
 AI systems are often deployed in critical applications such as healthcare, finance and security. Fraudulent AI claims in these sectors can lead to catastrophic consequences, including compromised data integrity, privacy breaches and even endangerment of human lives. 
 Governments and regulatory bodies need to establish clear guidelines and standards for AI claims. This includes defining what constitutes an AI system and setting benchmarks for performance and transparency. 
 Independent audits by third-party organisations can help verify AI claims. These audits should assess the validity of AI capabilities, performance metrics, and transparency of the processes. 
 Educating consumers about AI technologies can empower them to make informed decisions. Awareness campaigns and resources that explain AI concepts and red flags can help consumers identify and avoid deceptive AI claims. 
 It is imperative for businesses, regulators, investors and consumers to work together to ensure the integrity of AI development and deployment.

685803,Lifestyle,4,27/05/2024,Get ahead with AI,"Take advantage  of AI-driven tools to expedite and enhance a variety of tasks, whether for fun or work.","OPENAI’S ChatGPT took the world by storm in 2022, inspiring many others to develop generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools to capitalise on the craze.
 Since then, the tools available have expanded beyond chatbots to include AI-powered virtual assistants, content creation tools for social media and language translation services.
 Here are some noteworthy highlights worth exploring.
 Powering up productivity 
 Adobe now includes a built-in AI assistant in the free mobile version of its Acrobat PDF reader that is capable of summarising contents. 
 It will provide a detailed overview, complete with citation links to the parts of the document where the information is found.
 The AI can also answer questions about the document’s contents or even draft emails using information from the PDF.
 More recently, Adobe introduced AI features to its lightweight cloud-based app, Adobe Express, available for free on both computers and smartphones, giving users a taste of what the main, subscription-based creative suite has to offer.
 The all-in-one app incorporates video and photo editing and animation tools, with nifty AI features like object removal and replacement, along with automatic video captioning.
 The AI enhancements are quite powerful, producing convincing final images. For example, the object replacement tool can be used to change the colour of people’s shirts or what they are holding, while the removal tool is capable of getting rid of stray objects or people in a photo.
 Another neat feature of Express is the animate from audio tool, which offers users multiple preset characters that can be automatically lip-synced with the audio recording.
 There’s also the company’s free generative text-to-image AI tool, Firefly, which functions similar to Midjourney, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion.Online graphics tool Canva also offers AI-powered features for free, though it’s geared more towards photo editing than providing a more general set of tools like Express.
 Those looking to restore images taken with older cameras can check out simpler, web-based services like iloveimg.com and  letsenhance.io that are great for basic editing and upscaling. 
 On the productivity front, Google has been developing robust AI tools for its Workspace suite, encompassing apps such as Docs and Slides. However, these features are currently only available to a limited number of testers or through a subscription.
 But there are free alternatives available on the Workspace Marketplace, which can make a real difference in workflows and efficiency.
 One option is GPT Workspace, which works with Google Sheets, Slides, Docs, Drive, and even Gmail. The extension adds a sidebar, allowing users to input prompts or instructions into a chatbox for the AI.
 In Docs, it can handle tasks such as translations, fixing grammar and spelling, simplifying or better explaining portions of text, and making tonal changes. 
 In Slides, it can generate an entire slideshow from scratch, including text and AI-generated background images.
 It can also handle email responses in Gmail and read PDF documents, either uploaded directly to the sidebar or in Google Drive. The information from the PDF can, for instance, be used with Sheets to create a spreadsheet with additional formulas, tables and AI data analysis.
 Also, adding the browser extension for GPT Workspace to your Google Chrome can enhance your browsing experience. This extension provides webpage summarising capabilities similar to those found in Microsoft’s Bing Chat, available on Edge.
 Those more creatively inclined should pay a visit to Udio (udio.com), an AI music creation tool that generates songs from text prompts describing genres and instruments. Do note that specific artists’ names are off-limits.
 Udio can be used for free, though only a limited number of credits are given each day. Additional credits and a priority queue for tasks can be obtained through a monthly subscription, which starts at US$10 (RM46) per month.
 Google has a similar music generation tool called MusicFX that’s part of the company’s AI test kitchen. 
 The AI test kitchen also contains TextFX, a creative writing tool that helps with specific writing tasks, such as alliteration, visualising scenes, and creating similes. Additionally, it includes ImageFX, which functions like other generative image tools.
 Muze, on the other hand, is a free AI-powered music discovery website that can generate a list of songs depending on a user’s mood.
 Those in tertiary education can check out Semantic Scholar and Connected Papers, which use AI for researching academic articles.
 Connected Papers is capable of constructing a network of related academic works, including those cited by a specific paper and those citing that paper, providing a valuable resource for academics. 
 However, it is limited to handling five papers a month. Unlimited access requires a monthly subscription of US$3 (RM14). 
 Do keep in mind that, as with any AI product, it may miss certain things. 
 On the horizon
 In the wake of this year’s AI-centric Google I/O developer conference, it’s clear that there’s a lot more to come.
 Not only will we see more tools – like real-time scam alerts and greater integration of AI into Android – but also more services that will be able to identify AI-generated content.Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly making further plays in the AI space this year, with iOS 18 expected to add AI-powered features to notification, article summaries, voice memo transcriptions and photo editing, with Siri to get a new voice and more conversational tone.",openai chatgpt storm generative artificial intelligence tool capitalise craze tool chatbots virtual assistant content creation tool social medium language translation service noteworthy highlight productivity adobe assistant free mobile version acrobat pdf reader capable content detailed overview complete citation link document answer question document content draft pdf adobe feature cloud adobe express free computer user taste main subscription creative suite offer app video photo animation tool nifty feature removal replacement automatic video enhancement powerful final image replacement tool change colour people removal tool capable rid stray object people neat feature express animate audio tool user multiple character synced audio company free generative text image tool firefly function dall stable diffusion online graphic canva offer feature free photo set tool restore image simpler web service iloveimg letsenhance basic upscaling productivity front google robust tool suite apps doc slide feature tester free alternative marketplace real difference workflow efficiency option gpt workspace google sheet doc drive gmail extension sidebar user prompt instruction doc handle task translation grammar portion tonal slide entire slideshow scratch text background image email response pdf document sidebar google drive pdf instance sheet spreadsheet additional formula table data analysis browser extension gpt workspace chrome enhance experience extension webpage capability chat edge inclined pay visit udio udio music creation tool generates song text prompt genre instrument specific artist udio free limited credit day additional credit priority task monthly subscription month google music generation tool musicfx company test kitchen test kitchen creative tool specific task alliteration scene simile imagefx function generative image tool muze hand free music discovery website generate list song user mood tertiary education check semantic scholar paper academic article paper capable network academic specific paper paper valuable resource academic paper month unlimited access monthly subscription mind product horizon wake centric google developer conference lot tool real time scam alert integration android service content apple space io add powered feature notification article summary memo transcription siri voice conversational tone,"[(8, 0.28630027), (10, 0.7108182)]",10
685853,StarBiz,6,27/05/2024,Inculcating AI in business strategies is crucial to maximise growth,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) possesses the transformative power to elevate both efficiency and revenue in organisations, when harnessed effectively. 
 Achieving this success hinges on cultivating an environment that not only embraces AI but also trusts AI. As you embark on the journey to embed AI in your organisation, you need to reflect deeply on the following questions:
 Have you crafted an AI strategy that seeks transformative change, rather than just incremental improvements?
 AI offers exciting possibilities, yet it also carries inherent risks. What measures have you set in place to mitigate both internal and external threats?
 Human-AI collaboration is crucial for AI to be effective. How is your organisation fostering a culture where teams not only adopt but also trust and synergise with AI?
 This article addresses these essential topics and more, aiding board members by outlining some initial steps, posing critical questions, and highlighting considerations for effective AI implementation.
 Decoding the ‘Why’ of AI
 The Ernst & Young “CEO Outlook Pulse Survey” revealed that 76% of business leaders anticipate AI to principally boost efficiency, with minimal impact on revenue growth. However, a closer examination reveals that AI’s true potential spans far beyond mere operational optimisation. Its success lies in strategic adoption and application.
 Synergising AI, business strategies
 AI should not be an isolated venture but an integral part of overall business transformation. Start by intertwining your AI and corporate strategies, focusing on desired business outcomes. Successful AI programmes cut across organisational structures and are not confined to departmental initiatives.
 A transformational approach to AI encompasses complete value chains, fostering comprehensive rather than isolated improvements. 
 For instance, revamping an entire financial management process rather than expediting just one part can yield far more significant benefits. 
 An illustrative case of optimisation is that of a company seeking to reduce the time and effort required for its finance team to compile management reports. This task typically involves scrutinising competitor activities, crafting comparative analyses with industry peers, and analysing the data. 
 While the incorporation of AI yields some efficiencies in this specific process, the true potential of AI extends far beyond mere time management. For instance, AI could have been employed to provide strategic insights to enhance profit margins or identify and rectify potential revenue losses.
 Clear strategy ownership and outcome measurability are vital. Prioritise use cases that promise the most substantial impact, avoiding the trap of numerous proofs of concept.
 When aligning technology with strategy, discern whether to buy or build. Assess whether off-the-shelf solutions suffice, or if a bespoke approach would reap greater rewards.
 Boards may wish to ask: 
 > Is our AI strategy aligned to the business strategy? 
 > Is it transformative across entire value chains with trackable and quantifiable benefits?
 > Who is responsible for the AI strategy and execution?
 > Is there a clear strategy on technology (buy vs build)? 
 > Are all foundational elements – data, business processes, governance – in place to support the AI strategy?
 Navigating AI risks
 Delving into AI also means confronting the spectrum of associated risks – data privacy, ethical quandaries, and stringent regulatory landscapes. Then comes the looming question: If your AI system malfunctions, what then? Implementing robust checks and balances is non-negotiable to mitigate the possibility of misinformation.
 Boards may wish to ask: 
 > What controls are in place to govern AI? Is there a rollback strategy?
 > What does your responsible AI framework look like? 
 > What external risks, laws and regulations must you consider? 
 > What is the environmental impact of your AI strategy implementation? 
 > How autonomous is your AI? What human interventions are in place?
 The crux of AI transformation lies not only in technology but also in people. Upskilling staff and reshaping interactions with suppliers and customers are foundational. As AI redefines roles, redirecting your workforce’s potential to areas where they continue to add value is essential.
 Boards may wish to ask:
 > How does AI change the way our people work, and our interactions with suppliers and customers? 
 > How do we use trusted, responsible AI to drive brand value with customers, suppliers and our people? 
 > How are we going to upskill, reskill and redeploy our people to drive value?
 > How do we change people’s behaviors so that they embrace, use and trust AI?
 AI transcends industries and borders, and it is here to stay. How organisations take advantage of it is open to debate. No matter what your business strategy, we believe there is merit in assessing the value of an AI strategy to drive real business outcomes. Learn first, test second, then scale up, once the value is clear.

 “My suggestion is a code of  ethics drawn up by journalists themselves with a responsibility towards ensuring the well-being of the nation and mankind  in general,” he told reporters  after opening the inaugural Sarawak Media Conference here  yesterday.
 Abang Johari cited artificial intelligence (AI) as a new  techno­logy that should be monitored.
 “For example, generative AI can be misused to create false information. It can be difficult to evaluate whether information is genuine,” he said.
 The two-day conference  was organised by the Sarawak Public Communications Unit and Kuching Division Journalists Association in conjunction with the National Journalists Day (Hawana) celebration taking place here.
 In his speech earlier,  Abang Johari called on the  global media industry to have a code of ethics on the use of digital tools.
 “This is important to ensure that the media will use technolo­gical tools professionally, without misusing them for other  agendas.
 “I am pleased Malaysia is looking towards this and I hope  the global media industry will come up with an acceptable code,” he said.
 Abang Johari also said the Sarawak government welcomed input from the media industry towards providing credible  information in tandem with the state’s development.
 He said Sarawak is moving forward through its post-Covid development strategy which  is based on economic pros­perity, social inclusivity and environmental sustainability.

685501,StarEdu,8,26/05/2024,Dealing with AI in academia,,"The encroachment of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education is inevitable. 
 While embracing AI poses risks, it also offers unprecedented benefits. Dealing with AI therefore calls for measures to mitigate risks and capitalise on opportunities. 
 In academia, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, has sparked much debate.
 Generative AI is the use of AI to create new content, such as text and images. It uses machine learning to discern patterns and relationships in human-input datasets. 
 Once it learns these patterns, the technology can generate new content with promptings by humans. 
 Many recognise the benefits of AI in education. One of its most significant advantages is its ability to automate administrative tasks, allowing academics more time to focus on high-value student interactions. The most commonly reported benefit of generative AI tools is time-saving. Many educators are already using generative AI to create lesson plans and develop student learning tasks.
 Lecturers can use generative AI to create curriculum summaries, assessment rubrics, discussion topics, student lesson plans, learning resources and classroom activities. 
 Generative AI can be used together with the university management system to streamline tasks. Using AI tools alongside continuous quality improvement methods can significantly reduce teacher planning workloads.
 Generative AI also increases the efficiency of marking and feedback processes. 
 It’s not only the lecturers who gain from using generative AI. 
 Studies have shown its potential to personalise lesson plans for students with literacy and learning difficulties, with reported positive outcomes from such approaches.
 The biggest fear surrounding generative AI revolves around the rise of cheating cases. Many worry that it might hinder students’ critical thinking. 
 Sceptics argue that there is a possibility that AI will lead to a downgrading of human skills. 
 The use of generative AI could also lead to complacency, as there is a risk that students may become dependent on AI technology. 
 There are additional concerns around ethical issues such as inherent bias and data privacy. But many feel generative AI can benefit the student learning experience and foster creativity. 
 This means schools need an AI policy that includes guidelines for responsible use, addressing potential risks and defining what responsible use entails. It should also cover issues of bias and errors, including ethical considerations related to plagiarism and the proper use of secondary sources. 
 It has been suggested that AI policies must clearly state how the faculty intends to use AI tools and demonstrate a commitment to their fair and safe usage. 
 Lecturers should know what’s expected of them and how they can effectively use AI in the classroom to support learning.
 For example, ChatGPT can be treated similarly to calculators, being permitted for certain assignments but not for others. 
 Another approach is to allow students to use generative AI for specific parts of the task. For example, students can use ChatGPT to create outlines for their essays, then put their devices away and write their essays independently. This teaches students how to interact with AI and ask the right questions. 
 For today’s students, who will graduate into a world filled with generative AI programs, these are critical skills to learn. It’s worth remembering we’re in the early days of AI, and the technology is in a perpetual state of evolution. 
 By staying informed about the latest advancements, everyone can anticipate critical changes and adapt accordingly. Whatever it is, we need to deal with AI to create more positive outcomes for education. AI is here to stay.PROF DATUK DR AHMAD IBRAHIM

685313,Main,26,25/05/2024,White House seeks tech firms help to curb AI sexual exploitation,,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing the tech industry and financial institutions to shut down a growing market of abusive sexual images made with artificial intelligence technology.
 New generative AI tools have made it easy to transform someone’s likeness into a sexually explicit AI deepfake and share the realistic images across chatrooms or social media. The victims – be they celebrities or children – have little recourse to stop it.
 The White House is putting out a call looking for voluntary cooperation from companies in the absence of federal legislation. 
 By committing to a set of specific measures, officials hope the private sector can curb the creation, spread and monetisation of such non-consensual AI images, inclu­ding explicit images of children.
 “As generative AI broke on the scene, everyone was speculating about where the first real harms would come. I think we have the answer,” said Biden’s chief science adviser Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.
 She described a “phenomenal acceleration” of non-consensual imagery fuelled by AI tools and largely targeting women and girls in a way that can upend their lives.“If you’re a teenage girl or a gay kid, these are problems that people are experiencing right now,” she said. 
 “We’ve seen an acceleration because of generative AI that’s moving really fast. And the fastest thing that can happen is for companies to step up and take responsibility.”
 A document shared with AP ahead of its release yesterday calls for action from not just AI developers but payment processors, financial institutions, cloud computing providers, search engines and the gatekeepers – namely Apple and Google – that control what makes it onto mobile app stores.
 The private sector should step up to “disrupt the monetisation” of image-based sexual abuse, restricting payment access particularly to sites that advertise explicit images of minors, the administration said.
 Prabhakar said many payment platforms and financial institutions already say that they won’t support the kinds of businesses promoting abusive imagery.
 “But sometimes it’s not enforced; sometimes they don’t have those terms of service,” she said. “And so that’s an example of something that could be done much more rigorously.” — AP",washington president joe administration tech industry financial institution market abusive sexual image artificial intelligence technology generative tool easy transform likeness explicit share realistic image social medium victim celebrity child white house call voluntary cooperation company federal legislation specific measure official private sector curb creation spread monetisation consensual image explicit image child scene real harm biden chief science adviser arati prabhakar director white house office science technology policy phenomenal acceleration consensual imagery tool woman girl teenage girl gay kid people acceleration generative fastest happen company responsibility document release yesterday action developer payment processor financial institution provider engine gatekeeper apple google control mobile app store private sector step disrupt monetisation image sexual abuse payment access site explicit image minor administration payment platform financial institution support business abusive imagery term service,"[(6, 0.9925306)]",6
685473,StarBiz 7,12,25/05/2024,Impact of AI on jobs,,"FAR from heralding the end of jobs, artificial intelligence (AI) signals the start of a new era in which workers can be more productive and valuable than ever.
 Al does more than help workers do the old things faster as it opens the door to new business models and ways of creating value.
 The implications for businesses are huge as AI delivers significant top and bottom line benefits, increasing profitability and revenue.
 Sectors that are especially exposed to AI are experiencing nearly five times higher growth in labour productivity. 
 Rising labour productivity is a key driver of economic growth and increasing living standards, according to PwC in its inaugural 2024 Global AI jobs barometer report.
 For a worker, it means adapting to a changing job market as the skills required by employers in AI-exposed occupations are changing fast. 
 Old skills are disappearing from job ads and new skills are appearing faster in AI roles than in roles less exposed to it, says PwC.
 The jobs carry up to a 25% wage premium on average, underlining the value of the skills to companies, according to the report.

684927,StarBiz,4,24/05/2024,Nvidia delivers on AI hype by igniting US$140bil stock rally,,"NVIDIA Corp, the chipmaker at the centre of an artificial intelligence (AI) boom, gained in late trading after a bullish sales forecast showed that AI computing spending remains strong.
 Second-quarter revenue will be about US$28bil, topping the US$26.8bil predicted by analysts. Results in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 28, also beat projections – lifted by growth in Nvidia’s data-centre division.
 The big question heading into the earnings report was whether Nvidia’s latest numbers could justify the dizzying run-up in its stock. The shares had gained 92% this year through Wednesday’s close, fuelled by investor hopes that the company would continue to shatter expectations.The report didn’t disappoint, and chief executive officer Jensen Huang stoked the excitement by talking about the dawning of a new era. 
 “This is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,” he said in an interview, echoing one of his favourite themes. 
 “This is really exciting.”
 The upbeat outlook reinforces Nvidia’s status as the biggest beneficiary of AI spending. The company’s so-called AI accelerators –chips that help data centres develop chatbots and other cutting-edge tools – have become a hot commodity in the past two years, sending its sales soaring. Nvidia’s market valuation has skyrocketed as well, topping US$2.3 trillion.
 In the fiscal first quarter, Nvidia’s revenue more than tripled to US$26bil. Excluding certain items, profit was US$6.12 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about US$24.7bil and earnings of US$5.65 a share.
 The shares rose as much as 7.8% in extended trading on Wednesday, taking them above US$1,000 for the first time. The Santa Clara, California-based company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split and boosted its quarterly dividend by 150% to 10 US cents a share.
 The rally helped lift the shares of other companies associated with AI. Super Micro Computer Inc, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Dell Technologies Inc all gained in the wake of the results.
 Huang, in his signature black leather jacket, has become a celebrity in the AI era. 
 His company, which he co-founded in 1993, started as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. But he recognised that Nvidia’s chips were well-suited to developing AI software and that helped open a new market – and gave him a jump on competitors.
 The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot in 2022 then sparked a race between major technology companies to build their own AI infrastructure. The scramble made Nvidia’s H100 accelerators a must-have product. They sell for tens of thousands of dollars per chip and are often in scarce supply.
 For now, much of this new revenue comes from a small handful of customers. 
 A group of four companies –Amazon.com Inc, Meta Platforms Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google – are Nvidia’s largest buyers and have accounted for about 40% of sales. 
 Huang, 61, is trying to spread his bets by producing complete computers, software and services – aimed at helping more corporations and government agencies deploy their own AI systems.
 Nvidia’s data-centre division –now by far its largest source of sales – generated US$22.6bil of revenue last quarter. 
 Gaming chips provided US$2.6bil. Analysts had given targets of US$21bil for the data-centre unit and US$2.6bil for gaming.If the after-hours stock gain holds up in regular trading yesterday, Nvidia will add roughly US$140bil to its valuation. 
 That’s greater than the entire market capitalisation of Intel Corp, a chipmaker that once dwarfed Nvidia by every measure. And Nvidia’s US$28bil in projected quarterly sales would be more than twice what Intel is expected to report. 
 Wider market
 Nvidia has emphasised that it wants to sell its technology to a wider market – expanding beyond the giant cloud-computing providers known as hyperscalers. Huang said that AI is moving to consumer Internet companies, carmakers, biotechnology and health-care customers. Countries also are developing their own systems – a trend referred to as sovereign AI.
 These opportunities are creating multiple multibillion-dollar markets beyond cloud service providers, he said.
 The large-scale deployment of Nvidia chips by Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc is one sign of that expansion. 
 The automaker is using Nvidia gear to develop software that will operate self-driving vehicles.
 Still, hyperscalers remained a critical growth driver for Nvidia last quarter. They generated 45% of the company’s data-centre revenue. That suggests Nvidia is in the early stages of diversifying the business.
 The company’s new chip platform, called Blackwell, is now in full production, Huang said. And it lays the groundwork for generative AI that can handle trillions of parameters. 
 Next wave of growth
 “We are poised for our next wave of growth,” he said.
 The company will get “a lot” of its 2024 revenue from the new Blackwell chips, Huang said. But customers aren’t easing up on orders for its existing products – a concern among some analysts. Those buyers need the current generation to help them build out their infrastructure as quickly as possible, he said. 
 Demand for Nvidia’s products has outpaced supply, and Huang expects that to remain the case into next year. The company is also contending with other challenges: The increasing complexity of its technology, which now includes complete computer systems, means that its supply chain has become much more complicated, he said. That makes it more difficult to increase output. — Bloomberg

 The magazine’s editor was sacked last year, with Funke apologising to Schumacher’s family.
 Ferrari great Schumacher, now 55, has not been seen in public since he suffered a serious brain injury in a skiing accident on a family holiday in the French Alps in December 2013.
 Schumacher’s family maintains strict privacy about the former driver’s condition, with access limited to those closest to him.

684621,StarBiz,10,23/05/2024,Altman says AI is ‘safe enough’ as scandals raise concerns,,"Seattle: OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman defended his company’s artificial intelligence (AI) technology as safe for widespread use, as concerns mount over potential risks and lack of proper safeguards for ChatGPT-style AI systems.
 Altman’s remarks came at a Microsoft event in Seattle, where he spoke to developers just as a new controversy erupted over an OpenAI AI voice that closely resembled that of the actress Scarlett Johansson.
 The chief executive, who rose to global prominence after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, is also grappling with questions about the safety of the company’s AI following the departure of the team responsible for mitigating long-term AI risks.
 “My biggest piece of advice is this is a special time and take advantage of it,” Altman told the audience of developers seeking to build new products using OpenAI’s technology.
 “This is not the time to delay what you’re planning to do or wait for the next thing,” he added.
 OpenAI is a close partner of Microsoft and provides the foundational technology, primarily the GPT-4 large language model, for building AI tools.
 Microsoft has jumped on the AI bandwagon, pushing out new products and urging users to embrace generative AI’s capabilities.
 “We kind of take it for granted that GPT-4, while far from perfect ... is generally considered robust enough and safe enough for a wide variety of uses”, Altman said.
 Altman insisted that OpenAI had put in “a huge amount of work” to ensure the safety of its models.
 “When you take a medicine, you want to know what’s going to be safe, and with our model, you want to know it’s going to be robust to behave the way you want it to,” he added.
 However, questions about OpenAI’s commitment to safety resurfaced last week when the company dissolved its “superalignment” group, a team dedicated to mitigating the long-term dangers of AI.
 In announcing his departure, team co-leader Jan Leike criticised OpenAI for prioritising “shiny new products” over safety in a series of posts on X.
 “Over the past few months, my team has been sailing against the wind,” Leike said.
 “These problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren’t on a trajectory to get there.”
 This controversy was swiftly followed by a public statement from Johansson, who expressed outrage over a voice used by OpenAI’s ChatGPT that sounded similar to her voice in the 2013 film Her.
 The voice in question, called “Sky” was featured last week in the release of OpenAI’s more human-like GPT-4o model.
 In a short statement on Tuesday, Altman apologised to Johansson but insisted the voice was not based on hers. — AFP",seattle penai chief executive officer altman company artificial intelligence technology safe widespread concern potential risk proper safeguard chatgpt style system altman remark microsoft event seattle developer openai voice actress scarlett johansson chief executive global prominence openai chatgpt question safety company departure team responsible term risk biggest piece advice special time advantage altman audience developer build product technology time delay wait close partner microsoft foundational technology gpt language model tool bandwagon product user generative capability gpt perfect robust safe wide variety altman altman huge amount safety model safe model robust question commitment safety week company superalignment team term danger departure team leader jan leike openai shiny product safety series month wind leike hard concerned trajectory controversy public statement johansson outrage voice openai chatgpt voice film voice question sky week release openai human gpt model short statement tuesday altman johansson insisted voice afp,"[(9, 0.99313575)]",9
684329,StarBiz,11,22/05/2024,Microsoft debuts Copilot+  PCs with AI features,New addition to fuel strong profit growth for the firm,"SEATTLE: Microsoft debuted a new category of personal computers (PCs) with artificial intelligence (AI) features as it rushes to build the emerging technology into products across its business and compete with Alphabet and Apple .
 At an event on its campus in Redmond, Washington, chief executive Satya Nadella introduced what Microsoft calls “Copilot+” PCs, said it and a range of manufacturers would sell them, including Acer and Asustek Computer.
 Microsoft launched the laptops as its shares traded near record highs following a Wall Street rally driven by expectations that AI will fuel strong profit growth for the company and its Big Tech rivals.
 Able to handle more AI tasks without calling on cloud data centres, the new computers will start at US$1,000 and begin shipping on June 18.
 The ability to crunch AI data directly on the computer lets Copilot+ include a feature called “Recall” 
 “Recall” tracks everything done on the computer, from Web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.
 The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the Minecraft video game.
 Yusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. 
 At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be “the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.”
 Global PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.
 “People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,” said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.
 Microsoft’s new “Copilot+” computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the “Ultrabook” category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple’s MacBook Air. 
 Microsoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, would “soon” be available as part of Copilot.
 Microsoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings’ architecture. 
 It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.
 Microsoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. 
 Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.
 After Intel’s processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.
 The Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft’s Copilot software.
 Microsoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.
 Microsoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its deal with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.
 Last week, OpenAI and Alphabet’s Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. 
 Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.
 Windows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel’s processors. — Reuters",seattle category personal computer artificial intelligence rush technology product business apple event campus redmond washington chief executive satya nadella microsoft call copilot pc manufacturer acer computer microsoft share record wall street driven expectation fuel strong profit growth company tech rival task cloud data computer june ability crunch data computer copilot feature recall recall track computer voice chat history computer user search month company copilot voice assistant real time virtual coach user playing minecraft video game yusuf mehdi head consumer marketing microsoft company pc press event assistant reason upgrade time global shipment firm gartner microsoft category computer pc people convinced device experience justifies category copilot machine analyst ben creative strategy copilot computer marketing category highlight feature reminiscent ultrabook category thin form laptop intel manufacturer apple macbook air microsoft executive technology chatgpt maker openai copilot microsoft generation surface pro tablet surface laptop feature chip arm holding architecture technology prism software intel amd chip chip arm technology microsoft device action apple device photo software adobe microsoft device apple month chip analyst future laptop intel processor market decade maker lower power arm component window market qualcomm elite chip neural processing unit accelerate application microsoft copilot software microsoft product event day annual developer conference microsoft aim advantage race tool consumer deal openai jump alphabet race dominate field week google technology voice real time hallmark realistic voice conversation voice assistant google generative feature search engine maker pressure apple company custom chip design arm intel processor reuters,"[(5, 0.44439697), (14, 0.5518)]",14
684491,Main,22,22/05/2024,Saudis on AI spending blitz,,"ON a Monday morning in March, tech executives, engineers and sales representatives from Amazon, Google, TikTok and other companies endured a three-hour traffic jam as their cars crawled toward a mammoth conference at an event space  in the desert, 80km outside Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 The lure – billions of dollars in Saudi money as the kingdom seeks to build a tech industry to complement its oil  dominance.
 “To the Future,” a sign read on the approach to the event, called Leap.
 More than 200,000 people converged at the conference, including Adam Selipsky, CEO of Amazon’s cloud computing division, who announced a US$5.3bil investment in Saudi Arabia for data centres and artificial intelligence technology. Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, spoke of what a government minister called a “lifetime friendship” with the kingdom. Executives from Huawei and dozens of other firms made speeches.
 More than US$10bil in deals were done there, according to Saudi Arabia’s state press agency.
 “This is a great country,” Shou Chew, TikTok’s CEO, said during the conference, heralding the video app’s growth in the kingdom. “We expect to invest even more.”
 Everybody in tech seems to want to make friends with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom trains its sights on becoming a dominant player in AI – and is pumping in eye-popping sums to do so.
 Saudi Arabia created a US$100bil fund this year to invest in AI and other technology. It is in talks with Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and other investors to put an additional US$40bil into AI companies.
 In March, the government said it would invest US$1bil in a Silicon Valley-inspired startup accelerator to lure AI entrepreneurs to the kingdom.
 The initiatives easily dwarf those of most major nation-state investments.
 The spending blitz stems from a generational effort outlined in 2016 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and known as “Vision 2030”. Saudi Arabia is racing to diversify its oil-rich economy in areas like tech, tourism, culture and sports – investing a reported US$200mil a year for football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and planning a 160km-long mirrored skyscraper in the desert.
 For the tech industry, Saudi Arabia has long been a funding spigot. But the kingdom is now redirecting its oil wealth into building a domestic tech industry, requiring international firms to establish roots there if they want its money.
 If Crown Prince Mohammed succeeds, he will place Saudi Arabia in the middle of an escalating global competition among China, the United States and other countries like France that have made breakthroughs in generative AI. Combined with AI efforts by its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia’s plan has the potential to create a new power centre in the global tech industry.
 In Washington, many worry that the kingdom’s goals and authoritarian leanings could work against US interests – for instance, if Saudi Arabia ends up providing computing power to Chinese researchers and companies. The White House brokered a deal recently for Microsoft to invest in G42, an AI company in the UAE, which was intended partly to diminish China’s influence.
 For China, the Persian Gulf region offers a big market, access to deep-pocketed investors and a chance to wield influence in countries traditionally allied with the United States.
 Some industry leaders have begun to arrive.
 Jürgen Schmidhuber, an AI pioneer  who now heads an AI programme at Saudi Arabia’s premier research university, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, recalled the kingdom’s roots centuries ago as a centre for science and mathematics.
 “It would be lovely to contribute to a new world and resurrect this golden age,” he said. “Yes, it will cost money, but there’s a lot of money in this country.”
 The university, known as KAUST, has become a site of the US-Chinese technological showdown.
 Modelled on universities like the California Institute of Technology, KAUST is the kingdom’s premier scientific research school, bringing in foreign AI leaders and providing computing resources to build an epicentre for AI research.
 To achieve that aim, KAUST has often turned to China to recruit students and professors and to strike research partnerships, alarming US officials. They fear  students and professors from Chinese  military-linked universities will use KAUST to sidestep US sanctions and boost China in the race for AI supremacy,  analysts and US officials said.
 Of particular concern is the university’s construction of one of the region’s fastest supercomputers, which needs thousands of microchips made by Nvidia, the biggest maker of precious chips that power  AI systems.
 The university’s chip order, with an estimated value of more than US$100mil,  is being held up by a review from the US government, which must provide an export licence before the sale can go through.
 Schmidhuber is awaiting the completion of the supercomputer, Shaheen 3, which is a chance to attract more top talent to the Persian Gulf and to give researchers access to computing power often reserved for major companies.
 “No other university is going to have a similar thing,” he said.
 Some in Washington fear the supercomputer may provide researchers from Chinese universities access to cutting-edge computing resources they would not have in China.

683939,StarBiz,13,21/05/2024,Gen AI falling short of businesses’ expectations,"After big debut, impact for productivity gains still lagging","SINGAPORE: Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) promised a roaring business revolution, but 18 months after ChatGPT’s big-bang debut, its impact is more like a whimper.
 Enterprises had underestimated what they needed to use gen AI and overrated its impact on businesses, observers said.
 Consultancy firm McKinsey, which in July 2023 projected gen AI to add a US$4.4 trillion bump to global corporate profits annually, said in April that adoption among corporations has not gone far beyond Gen AI pilots and a few use cases or situations in which the technology could be used.
 Gayatri Shenai, a senior partner at the firm, said in a webinar: “The value really comes from enterprise-wide adoption and scale. And here, most organisations are struggling.”
 The hubris following ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022 might explain a few let-downs.
 Some of the test projects that firms picked in 2023 were not scalable – like launching Gen AI for a function performed by eight people – and would not have delivered value, said Matthew Candy, IBM Consulting’s global managing partner for Gen AI.
 “There was pressure, questions being asked from above, and lots of people were feeling like they’ve got to do something, show something,” he said.
 Results of a poll of 300 executives by the MIT Technology Review Insights for Telstra International in late 2023 found that first adopters of Gen AI reported lower confidence in their firm’s technology than others.
 Commenting on the findings, MIT Sloan School research fellow Michael Schrage said: “It is disappointing how tactical that experimentation has been. Too many experts look at Gen AI as a way of automating or augmenting existing workflows and processes, rather than rethinking use case fundamentals or the desired outputs and outcomes they really want.”
 Hallucination – the inclination of Gen AI to fabricate stuff based on probability – is a major obstacle.
 OCBC Bank, which launched a ChatGPT bot in October 2023, has 250 AI models and a 150-strong data science and engineering team that oversees them.
 It uses a multitude of tools to test the accuracy, limitations and biases of its large language models.
 Donald MacDonald, the bank’s head of group data office, conceded: “Gen AI got many companies excited with the possibilities, but they are now finding it challenging to deploy in production.”
 Organisations are also falling short of AI enablers – such as an AI strategy, talent, data, infrastructure, operating models and culture.
 Firms need to have a fit-for-purpose data architecture, sufficient computing power and robust connectivity to handle the immense data volumes, said Geraldine Kor, Telstra International’s head of global enterprise.
 Data that is good enough to generate real-time insights is another top constraint.
 In a survey conducted by Salesforce and YouGov around March, about eight in every 10 Singapore workers said the data ingested by their AI models must be accurate, comprehensive and secure, before they would use them with trust.
 “For real-world applications, we simply cannot rely on luck. We need people to trust the technology,” Professor Lam Kwok Yan, a cyber-security expert from the school of computing at Nanyang Technological University, said at a conference on May 7.
 Then there is the shortage of AI talent, with no short-term relief in sight.
 In a global poll of 2,000 executives in nine developed economies by recruiter Adecco and Oxford Economics in late 2023, Singapore topped the list for employers who planned to hire AI talent from outside their firms.
 Given that in 2023, 34% of resident employees lasted only one to five years in a job, Betul Genc, Adecco’s head of Asean, was not surprised. Managers may find it more financially viable to hire over reskilling, she said, even if that is not sustainable.
 She said: “This approach risks creating a skills shortage that may drive salaries upwards, intensifying competition in the job market.”
 Still, employers are too tied up with the AI rat race to focus on training their employees, according to another study by workforce solutions provider Persolkelly.
 In its February survey, only 27% of local employers said they have a comprehensive plan to help employees replaced by Gen AI find new jobs, compared with the Asia-Pacific regional average of 36%.
 “Despite being acknowledged as the company’s most significant asset, employees are nevertheless frequently disregarded,” it wrote in the report.
 The question is how many businesses will be ready to deploy Gen AI effectively.
 Workers will remain at the core.
 Brad Anderson, president of products, user experience and engineering at experience management firm Qualtrics, said: “Qualtrics research shows that Singaporeans are some of the most open to using and engaging with AI globally. But when we look at how they want to use AI, it’s clear that customers and employees want AI in the passenger seat assisting them, not the driver’s seat replacing them.”
 Clients are using its AI tools to push up customer responses to human agents, and help managers act on both customer and staff feedback, he added.
 Businesses will find out that a patchwork of models and technologies, and not one Gen AI model, is what they need, IBM’s Candy said.
 He said: “People are starting to realise the complexity of the landscape that’s going to evolve, and therefore the need to think about how I govern it, how I manage it, how I build a fabric and a layer that can connect all of these different technologies and skills.”
 Companies without data good enough to use Gen AI might start in areas where data reliability is less critical, suggested Sujith Abraham, general manager of Salesforce in Asean.
 “For instance, account summaries or case summaries are not as reliant on data quality. Businesses can start there and continue to improve and refine its data by experimentation,” he said.
 Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said many small and medium enterprises are using gen AI tools for personal productivity tasks rather than job or process transformation.
 These firms could integrate gen AI into business processes, such as enhancing customer service through sentiment analysis or for swift and accurate first-level customer inquiries.
 “A 20% increase in productivity for the owner or team can significantly impact operations,” Ang said. — The Straits Times/ANN",generative artificial intelligence gen roaring business revolution month bang debut impact whimper enterprise underestimated gen impact business observer firm mckinsey gen bump global corporate profit adoption corporation pilot situation technology gayatri senior partner firm webinar enterprise wide adoption scale organisation hubris chatgpt debut november test project firm scalable gen function people matthew candy ibm global managing partner gen pressure question people poll executive technology review insight telstra international late adopter lower confidence firm technology finding mit sloan school fellow michael schrage disappointing tactical experimentation expert workflow fundamental output outcome inclination gen fabricate stuff probability major obstacle bank chatgpt bot october model strong data science engineering team tool test accuracy limitation language model macdonald bank head data office gen company possibility deploy production organisation short enablers strategy talent data infrastructure model culture firm purpose data architecture sufficient power robust connectivity immense data volume kor telstra international head global enterprise data generate real time insight top constraint survey salesforce yougov march singapore worker data model comprehensive secure trust real application rely luck people technology professor lam kwok yan cyber security expert school nanyang technological university conference shortage talent short term relief global poll executive economy adecco oxford economics late singapore list employer hire talent firm employee job betul genc adecco head surprised manager viable hire sustainable approach risk skill shortage drive salary upwards competition job market employer rat race focus employee workforce solution february survey local employer comprehensive plan employee gen job pacific regional average company asset employee report question business ready deploy gen worker core brad anderson president product user experience engineering experience management firm qualtrics qualtrics singaporean customer employee passenger seat seat client tool push customer response human agent manager customer staff feedback business model technology model ibm candy people realise complexity landscape govern manage build fabric layer connect technology company data gen start data reliability critical sujith abraham manager salesforce asean instance account summary reliant data quality business improve refine data experimentation yuit president association medium medium enterprise tool personal productivity task job process transformation firm gen business customer service sentiment analysis swift level customer inquiry productivity owner team impact operation strait time,"[(14, 0.9971787)]",14

 The meeting is a follow-up to the inaugural global AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in Britain last year, where dozens of countries voiced their fears to leading AI firms about the risks posed by their tech.
 Safety is again on the agenda at the AI Seoul Summit starting today and representatives are expected from leading AI firms, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Google DeepMind, French AI firm Mistral, Microsoft and Anthropic.
 “As with any new technology, AI brings new risks, including deliberate misuse from those who mean to do us harm,” South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said yesterday in a joint article.
 “However, with new models being released almost every week, we are still learning where these risks may emerge,” they said in the piece, published by the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo and Britain’s i newspaper.
 The stratospheric success of ChatGPT soon after its 2022 release sparked a gold rush in generative AI, with tech firms around the world pouring billions of dollars into developing their own models.
 Generative AI models can gene­rate text, photos, audio and even video from simple prompts, and its proponents have heralded them as a breakthrough that will improve lives and businesses around the world.
 But critics, rights activists and governments have warned that they can be misused in a wide variety of situations, including the manipulation of voters through fake news stories or so-called “deepfake” pictures and videos of politicians.
 Many have called for international standards to govern the development and use of AI.

 “We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it,” she told the event organised by the Swiss Institute of International Studies, associated to the University of Zurich.
 “It could bring tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society.”
 Georgieva said the world economy had become more prone to shocks in recent years, citing the global pandemic in 2020, as well as the war in Ukraine.
 Although she expected more shocks, particularly due to the climate crisis, the world remained remarkably resilient, she said.
 “We are not in global recession,” said Georgieva, who was heckled by protesters calling for action on climate change and tackling developing world debt.

681157,StarBiz,12,14/05/2024,Central bank has AI in  its intervention corner,Stocks cap a third straight week of net inflows,"TAIPEI: As a strong US dollar drives up currency volatility across Asia, an artificial intelligence-fuelled tech boom has offered Taiwan some reprieve. 
 The local currency weakened less than the South Korean won and Japanese yen in April, a turbulent month for the region as Federal Reserve (Fed) policy bets shifted. 
 That relative strength came even as authorities kept the amount of intervention “similar to” the previous two months, according to a central bank official. 
 Analysts attributed the resilience to a tech-led exports recovery that’s allowing a steady supply of the US dollar, and an equities rebound driven by foreign inflows. 
 Taiwanese stocks capped a third straight week of net inflows and the local benchmark has outperformed peers since mid-April, exchange data showed. 
 “Taiwan doesn’t need to step up intervention like Japan due to a rebound in the electronics and semiconductor industries,” Eugene Tsai, head of the foreign exchange department at Taiwan’s central bank, said in a press briefing last week. 
 He added that US dollar supply was “relatively stable.” 
 A gauge measuring swings in the Taiwan dollar over a rolling 30-day period, known as the historical volatility, trails that of the won and the yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 The local currency fell 1.7% against the greenback in April, less than the won and the yen, whose slump spurred verbal warnings from authorities in South Korea and suspected intervention in Japan during the month. 
 The two countries even teamed up to air concerns over their currency weakness in mid-April, while Bank Indonesia hiked rates in a surprise move to defend the rupiah.  
 In contrast, officials in Taiwan have refrained from sending as strong a message to the market. 
 Taiwan’s central bank “didn’t need to intervene too much because local equities performance is good,” said Ju Wang, head of greater China foreign exchange and rates strategy at BNP Paribas SA. 
 In a separate note, the brokerage said a lack of financial instability and a stable foreign exchange supply due to the exports recovery have allowed the central bank to “keep a relatively hands-off stance”. 
 Taiwan’s exports to the United States jumped 81.6% year-on-year to US$10.2bil in April, driven by shipments of information, communication and audio-video products. 
 Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which assembles the majority of Apple Inc’s smartphones, is among the biggest contributors to the equity benchmark Taiex index’s rebound since April 22.  
 Policymakers’ stance on currency, however, may shift if the US dollar resumes its uptrend, or foreigners’ turn their back against the local stock market. 
 If Fed speakers continue to guide markets to price in later or fewer interest rate cuts, or even a hike, then US dollar strength may return and that would mean officials may still need to be active on intervention, according to Christopher Wong, a foreign exchange strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. — Bloomberg",taipei strong dollar drive currency volatility artificial intelligence tech boom taiwan local currency south korean japanese yen april turbulent month region federal reserve fed policy bet relative strength authority previous month central bank official analyst resilience tech export recovery steady supply dollar equity foreign inflow taiwanese stock straight week net inflow local benchmark peer mid exchange data taiwan step intervention japan electronics semiconductor industry tsai head foreign exchange department central bank press week dollar supply stable gauge swing dollar day period historical volatility yen data bloomberg local currency april yen verbal warning authority korea intervention japan month country air concern currency weakness april bank indonesia rate defend rupiah contrast official strong message market taiwan central bank intervene local equity performance wang head foreign exchange rate strategy paribas separate note brokerage lack financial instability stable foreign exchange supply export recovery central bank hand stance taiwan export bil april driven shipment communication video product hai precision industry majority apple smartphones biggest contributor equity benchmark taiex rebound policymakers stance currency dollar resume foreigner local stock market speaker guide market price fewer rate cut dollar strength return official active intervention christopher foreign exchange strategist chinese banking corp bloomberg,"[(9, 0.7378671), (10, 0.04178847), (12, 0.21596806)]",9
680571,Lifestyle,6,13/05/2024,AI takes flight,"An AI-controlled fighter jet took a US Air  Force leader for a historic ride, heralding a new chapter in autonomous aerial combat.","WITH the midday sun blazing, an experimental orange and white F-16 fighter jet launched with a familiar roar that is a hallmark of US airpower.
 But the aerial combat that followed was unlike any other: This F-16 was controlled by artificial intelligence (AI), not a human pilot. And riding in the front seat was Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall.
 AI marks one of the biggest advances in military aviation since the introduction of stealth in the early 1990s, and the Air Force has aggressively leaned in. Even though the technology is not fully developed, the service is planning for an AI-enabled fleet of more than 1,000 unmanned warplanes, the first of which will operate by 2028.It was fitting that the dogfight took place at Edwards Air Force Base, a vast desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the speed of sound and the military incubated its most secret aerospace advances. Inside classified simulators and buildings with layers of shielding against surveillance, a new test-pilot generation is training AI agents to fly in war.
 Kendall travelled here to see AI fly in real time and make a public statement of confidence in its future role in air combat.
 “It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,” Kendall said in an interview after he landed. 
 The AP, along with NBC, was granted permission to witness the secret flight on the condition that it would not be reported until it was complete because of operational security concerns.The AI-controlled F-16, called Vista, flew Kendall in lightning- fast manoeuvres at more than 550mph (885kph) that put pressure on his body at five times the force of gravity. 
 It went nearly nose-to-nose with a second human-piloted F-16 as both aircraft raced within 1,000ft (305m) of each other, twisting and looping to try to force their opponent into vulnerable positions.
 At the end of the hourlong flight, Kendall climbed out of the cockpit, grinning. 
 He said he’d seen enough during his flight that he’d trust this still-learning AI with the ability to decide whether or not to launch weapons in war.
 There’s a lot of opposition to that idea. Arms control experts and humanitarian groups are deeply concerned that AI one day might be able to autonomously drop bombs that kill people without further human consultation, and they are seeking greater restrictions on its use.
 “There are widespread and serious concerns about ceding life-and-death decisions to sensors and software,” the International Committee of the Red Cross has warned. 
 Autonomous weapons “are an immediate cause of concern and demand an urgent, international political response”.
 Kendall said there will always be human oversight in the system when weapons are used.
 The military’s shift to AI-enabled planes is driven by security, cost and strategic capability. If the United States and China end up in conflict, for example, today’s US Air Force fleet of expensive, manned fighters will be vulnerable because of gains on both sides in electronic warfare, space and air defence systems. China’s air force is on pace to outnumber the US, and it is also amassing a fleet of flying unmanned weapons.
 Future war scenarios envision swarms of American unmanned aircraft providing an advance attack on enemy defences to give the US the ability to penetrate an airspace without high risk to pilot lives. But the shift is also driven by money. 
 The Air Force is still hampered by production delays and cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which will cost an estimated US$1.7 trillion (RM8.05 trillion).
 Smaller and cheaper AI-  controlled unmanned jets are the way ahead, Kendall said.
 Vista’s military operators say no other country in the world has an AI jet like it, where the software first learns from millions of data points in a simulator, then tests its conclusions during actual flights. 
 That real-world performance data is then put back into the simulator, where the AI processes it to learn more.
 China has AI, but there’s no indication it has found a way to run tests outside of a simulator. And, like a junior officer first learning tactics, some lessons can only be learned in the air, Vista’s test pilots said.
 Until you actually fly, “it’s all guesswork”, chief test pilot Bill Gray said. “And the longer it takes you to figure that out, the longer it takes before you have useful systems.”
 Vista flew its first AI-controlled dogfight in September 2023, and there have only been about two dozen similar flights since. But the programs are learning so quickly from each engagement that some AI versions getting tested on Vista are already beating human pilots in air-to-air combat.
 The pilots at this base are aware that, in some respects, they may be training their replacements or shaping a future construct where fewer of them are needed.
 But they also say they would not want to be up in the sky against an adversary with AI-controlled aircraft if the US does not also have its own fleet.
 “We have to keep running. And we have to run fast,” Kendall said. – AP",midday sun experimental orange white fighter jet familiar roar hallmark aerial combat artificial intelligence human pilot front seat air force secretary kendall mark biggest advance military aviation introduction stealth air force technology developed service planning fleet unmanned warplane dogfight edward air force base vast desert facility chuck yeager speed sound military secret aerospace advance classified simulator building layer surveillance test pilot generation training agent war kendall fly real time public statement confidence future role air combat security risk kendall interview permission witness secret flight condition complete operational security concern vista kendall lightning fast manoeuvre kph pressure body time gravity nose human aircraft force opponent vulnerable position hourlong flight kendall cockpit flight trust ability launch weapon war lot opposition idea arm control expert humanitarian concerned day bomb kill people human consultation restriction widespread concern life death decision sensor software international committee red cross autonomous weapon concern demand urgent international political response kendall human oversight system weapon military shift plane security cost strategic capability united china conflict air force fleet expensive fighter vulnerable gain electronic warfare space air defence system air force pace outnumber fleet unmanned weapon future war scenario envision swarm american advance attack enemy defence ability airspace risk pilot life money air force production delay overrun joint strike fighter cost cheaper unmanned jet vista military operator country jet software million data simulator test conclusion actual flight real performance data simulator learn china indication test junior officer tactic lesson air vista test pilot guesswork chief test pilot bill gray figure system vista flew dogfight september dozen flight program engagement version vista beating human pilot air air combat pilot base aware training replacement future construct fewer sky adversary aircraft fleet kendall,"[(3, 0.9963238)]",3
680451,Main,19,12/05/2024,AI not possible without the wealth of human knowledge,,"THERE is no artificial intelligence without the fruits of human inquiry.
 Today’s generative AI applications were built on a foundation of such information, drawn from across the internet and from various databases totalling, according to at least one estimate, somewhere around 300 billion words.
 That’s a lot of intellectual property, much of it produced by successive generations of professional writers, honed and polished by editors and sent out into the world by publishers in newspapers, magazines, books and more.
 It’s hard to put a price on such a thing or even to measure the collective value of such an incredible library. But it definitely should not be free.
 But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.
 If you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?
 That’s why many newspapers, including the Tribune, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.
 Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the internet and it’s technically possible to copy it. They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.
 There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.
 For decades, newspapers like this one have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed and followed fights over public works. In most every United States city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.
 The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.
 Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.
 AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.
 The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.
 OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognise the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was US$90bil (RM436.6bil).
 Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps – to develop the code, as it were – has value.

680473,StarEdu,8,12/05/2024,"AI, the new character teacher",Onus on us to navigate tech that’s moulding young minds and morals,"As we sip our morning coffee, virtual assistants like Alexa brief us on the day’s schedule.
 This mundane routine masks a profound revolution unfolding right in our homes – the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. AI isn’t only changing how we live; it’s also redefining the way our children learn, think and develop character.
 Consider this astonishing fact: AI can predict your child’s learning difficulties even before they manifest in the classroom. 
 Researchers have developed algorithms that analyse children’s interactions with educational apps, flagging potential learning disabilities like dyslexia or adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) long before traditional methods. 
 This early intervention is a game changer, offering a future where no child slips through the educational cracks.
 Furthermore, AI-driven data analytics are enhancing the ability of educators to understand the diverse needs of students. By examining patterns in large sets of educational data, AI can provide insights into the effectiveness of teaching methods and curricula, leading to more informed decisions that can tailor educational content to the needs of individual learners.
 But AI’s educational prowess doesn’t stop at early detection. It’s reshaping our educational paradigms. In Sweden, an AI-powered language learning app called “Elevate” has made headlines for its ability to adapt to each student’s learning style, pacing and retention capacity, resulting in a 30% faster learning rate compared with traditional methods. 
 Imagine a classroom where each child’s unique learning curve is not only recognised but embraced and catered to. That’s the future AI is building.
 AI is also transforming the way homework is assigned and completed. With smart algorithms, homework can now be customised to challenge students at the right level, promote better understanding, and provide immediate feed­back to keep them motivated. This ensures that students are neither bored with tasks that are too easy nor discouraged by those that are too difficult.
 Now, let’s venture into the realm of the extraordinary. In Japan, elementary schools are using AI robots to teach not only language and maths, but also empathy and social skills. 
 These robots, equipped with emotional intelligence algorithms, interact with students, teaching them to recognise and respond to emotional cues. Examples of these robots are RoBoHon and Musio X. 
 In a world where digital fluency is as crucial as literacy, these AI companions are preparing our children for a future where humans and machines coexist.
 Yet, AI’s impact transcends the classroom walls. It’s in our living rooms, shaping family dynamics. An intriguing example is the AI-powered family gaming platforms that are revolutionising how families spend time together such as Minecraft: Education Edition and Kidgeni. These platforms use AI to create interactive, educational games that adapt to the family’s interests, making learning a fun and engaging activity that bonds rather than isolates.
 The “wow” factor of AI in education also lies in its subtlety. It’s in the AI-curated YouTube playlists that subtly influence your child’s cognitive development, in the smart toys that teach problem-solving, and even in the virtual reality field trips that bring historical events to life.
 These experiences are not only educational; they’re also character-building, instilling a sense of curiosity, critical thinking and a global perspective.
 Furthermore, AI is facilitating a new era of personalised learning paths. Adaptive learning systems can now curate and recommend resources from across the web to supplement a child’s educa­tion, ensuring they receive a well-rounded and expansive learning experience that is not confined by the resources of their local environment.
 However, with these advancements come responsibilities. The ethical implications of AI in our children’s lives are profound. From privacy concerns to the need for human oversight in AI education, the path forward is a delicate balance between embracing AI’s potential and safeguarding our children’s futures.
 We must also consider the socio-economic implications as AI becomes more pervasive in education. Ensuring equitable access to these advanced technologies is critical to avoid widening the educational divide. Initiatives to bridge the digital gap and bring AI tools to underserved communities are vital to ensuring that the benefits of AI in education are available to all.
 Indeed, the AI revolution in our homes is more than a technological wave; it’s a transformative force shaping the minds and morals of our future generations. As educators, parents and guardians of this new digital frontier, it’s our task to navigate this revolution thoughtfully. 
 The future is not only about humans teaching machines; it’s also about what machines will teach our children and us. We stand on the brink of an era where AI not only augments education, but also becomes a cornerstone of it.

680503,Lifestyle,7,12/05/2024,Using AI to translate manga,,"A JAPANESE startup announced recently it aims to use artificial intelligence to help translate manga comics into English five times faster and 90% cheaper than at present.
 Manga titles such as One Piece and Dragon Ball are a huge success story for Japan, with the market projected to be worth US$42.2bil (approximately RM200bil) by 2030, according to the startup, Orange Inc.
 But it said only about two percent of Japan’s annual output of 700,000 manga volumes are released in English, “partly due to the difficult and lengthy translation process and the limited number of translators”.
 But with its technology, Orange aims to produce 500 English-language mangas per month, five times more than the industry’s current capacity, and 50,000 volumes in five years. Other languages will come later.
 Overcoming manga slang
 “Compared to translation of a book, translating Japanese used in manga, which uses very short sentences of conversational language often full of slang, is extremely difficult,” said Orange’s marketing vice-president Tatsuhiro Sato.
 “It is also difficult to figure out if the particular quote was actually said at a scene, or the line was a murmur inside one’s heart describing a mental landscape,” Sato told AFP.
 Other challenges include the original text often being written vertically and finding equivalents for Japan’s many words to convey noises.
 The firm announced that it had raised 2.92 billion yen (US$19mil, RM90mil) in funding from major publisher Shogakukan and nine venture capital groups including the government-backed JIC Venture Growth Investments.
 It said that its tool will also help the industry fight piracy in the industry, which is estimated to be worth US$5.5bil (RM26bil) annually according to the Content Overseas Distribution Association. – AFP",japanese startup aim artificial intelligence translate manga comic english time cheaper manga title ball huge success story japan market worth bil bil startup orange percent japan annual output manga volume english difficult lengthy translation process translator technology orange english language month time industry current capacity volume manga slang translation book japanese manga short sentence conversational language difficult orange marketing vice president tatsuhiro sato difficult figure scene murmur heart mental landscape sato afp challenge original text equivalent japan noise firm yen mil funding major publisher shogakukan venture capital government jic venture growth investment industry fight piracy industry worth bil bil content overseas distribution association afp,"[(1, 0.9901738)]",1

 The information, via cloud computing, will be tapped from the various ministries, said Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
 The Prime Minister made the promise after a question from a student representative about having access to advanced computer facilities via a centralised cloud computing.
 “This is about synergy, cloud computing at the moment has limited access, but our policy is that we want to accelerate (access to information).
 “We will ask the Digital Ministry, Communications Ministry and the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry to coordinate this in a simpler format.
 “Give us two weeks. All the research bodies in the inter-ministry have to be ready in terms of access for all the universities,” he said at the launch of the Malaysia Artificial Intelligence Nexus-Boosting the Future at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
 Also present were Comm­unications Minister Fahmi Fadzil, Digital Minister Gobind Singh Deo, Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir, Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang and Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Mustapha Sakmud.
 Anwar said the government had synchronised all scientific institutions with universities, which had been working in silos and had untapped research. 
 Mandatory identification of departments and professors in complementing research fields was enforced last year. 
 He then went on to point out the need for synergy cuts across many aspects, including the Prime Minister’s Office, Cybersecurity Malaysia and Defence Ministry.
 He added that it was important to anticipate threats from outside, which meant strengthening cybersecurity in terms of AI.
 Earlier, in his speech, he called for the acceleration of efforts to push the pace of AI development in the country.
 He said the governance of the AI ecosystem needed to be systematic, with professional and skilled talent who can work with multinational corporations and the Malaysian Artificial Intelligence Consortium (MAIC).
 He said there had to be emphasis on mathematics and science at universities, and they had to be made more appealing as there was a lack of interest in these subjects among the younger generation.
 He also said there was a weakness in terms of specialisation, especially with a shortage of 30,000 engineers.
 “We cannot use old approaches. If we want more engineers, then a quicker approach is needed to produce them. Changes must be made swiftly and properly,” he said.
 Anwar presented an appointment letter to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia for the setting up of the MAIC.

679379,StarBiz,8,09/05/2024,Regulatory oversight on artificial intelligence vital,Upholding ESG pillars in cybersecurity key to growth,"PETALING JAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) in the telecommunications (telecoms)space is in need of regulatory oversight to ensure that environmental, social and governance (ESG) pillars in cybersecurity are upheld, say analysts.
 Having attended the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s International Regulatory Conference 2024, Kenanga Research said the development of AI governance policies is essential to inspire trust and displace suspicion surrounding AI.
 “Legislation and guidelines should be in place to counter cybersecurity threats to the telecoms industry and its users arising from AI. 
 “This includes the perpetration of online scams, proliferation of deep fakes and phishing,” it said in a report yesterday.
 Kenanga Research noted that at this early juncture, only the European Union has implemented broad-based acts to regulate AI.
 For other countries, to kickstart the journey of regulating AI, Kenanga Research said Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (Imda) believes that AI providers should be transparent and forthcoming in their disclosures to highlight any risks presented by AI. 
 “Hence, this would result in better understanding and thus enable organisations and regulators to work towards risk-management measures in mitigating AI threats,” said the research house.
 Imda is a statutory board under the Singapore Communications and Information Ministry.
 Additionally, Kenanga Research said organisations and digital citizens should leverage AI as an effective tool to enhance cybersecurity. 
 “In other words, this involves using AI to fight AI,” it said.
 Separately, Kenanga Research highlighted the sustained traction in the Global System for Mobile Communications Association’s (GSMA) efforts to develop a globally harmonised framework of principles and standards, which will result in the sustainable and ethical use of AI. 
 “The GSMA’s principles-based ethics framework applies a balanced approach, where it acts as a guide to ensure that AI operates within its boundaries, without restricting its normal course of development.”
 Citing local mobile network operator YTL Communications Sdn Bhd as an example, Kenanga Research said the group is playing its part in shaping the future of AI in Malaysia via its upcoming YTL AI Cloud service. 
 “It will be powered by the Nvidia Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud to accelerate the development of generative AI.
 “Its AI compute power will surpass more than 300 exaflops, rendering it as one of the fastest supercomputers in the world,” said Kenanga Research, which is maintaining an “overweight” call on the telecoms sector.
 “We believe that investors are less cautious on 5G as monetisation opportunities emerge from selling managed solutions and cloud offerings to enterprise clients in the immediate term. 
 “Furthermore, as adoption of generative AI cloud solutions gains momentum, this could emerge as an earnings growth driver for mobile operators over the longer term.”
 On top of that, the research house said the looming announcement of the official 5G dual network policy directive would finally resolve uncertainty that has weighed on sector sentiment.

679393,StarBiz,11,09/05/2024,AI boom set to fuel  data centre deals in Asia,Region accounts for more than half of global M&A in 2024,"SINGAPORE: Global private equity investors and asset managers are readying for billions of US dollars worth of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and investments linked to data centres in Asia Pacific, as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom fuels demand for digital infrastructure.
 The intense pace of deals in the world’s most populous region comes as countries and companies respond to booming demand for AI, calling for more data capacity, industry executives said.
 Asia Pacific, including Japan, has led dealmaking activities in the global data centre market this year, with M&A value totalling US$840.47mil, more than half of the global amount, LSEG data showed.
 In 2023, the region’s data centre deals hit a record high of US$3.45bil, according to LSEG. That tally is set to be surpassed this year with at least a couple of large transactions in the pipeline.
 A number of financial sponsors, including global investment powerhouse Blackstone Inc, are looking to acquire AirTrunk, which owns 11 hyperscale data centres in Australia and the rest of the region, sources close to the transaction said.
 AirTrunk owners, Macquarie Group and Canada’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP), are aiming to value the business at up to A$15bil or US$9.8bil, sources said, in what could be Asia’s largest data centre transaction this year.
 AirTrunk, Blackstone, Macquarie and PSP declined to comment.
 “The AI revolution is creating an unprecedented wall of demand for high-quality data-centre capacity,” said Garren Cronin, managing director of Cadence Advisory, which advised on Australian data centre operator NEXTDC’s US$861mil capital raising in April.
 “The new capacity that needs to be built in Asia Pacific in the next three to five years is simply mind blowing. My expectation is that deal flow in the data centre space will intensify in 2024.”
 Microsoft Corp last week said it would invest US$2.2bil over the next four years in Malaysia to expand its cloud and AI services across Asia.
 The rise of data centre investments in Asia follows a similar trajectory to that seen in the United States and Europe with technology giants including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc and Meta Platforms rapidly expanding their AI capabilities.
 Microsoft will open its first Asian data centre in Thailand, the company said last Wednesday, a day after announcing US$1.7bil worth of investments in AI and cloud facilities in neighbouring Indonesia.
 Other potential deals in Asia include Indonesia’s state-owned Telkom Indonesia’s sale of a stake in its data centre business worth US$1bil and Japan’s NEC weighing a US$500mil data centre sale, according to news reports.
 Telkom senior vice-president of investor relations Ahmad Reza told Reuters yesterday that Telkom is open to strategic partnerships to bring its data centre business arm NeutraDC new capabilities and new markets.
 “We have explored several potential partners, but we are still evaluating for the best one,” he said. “We expect to finish this process by the end of this year.”
 NEC said it was not able to comment on market speculation.
 US investment firm Bain Capital is seeking credit financing for the international assets of data centre operator Chindata and investments for its China business, people close to Bain Capital said.
 Bain, which took Chindata private from the Hong Kong bourse last year in a US$3.16bil deal, declined to comment.
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), which invested in AirTrunk in 2017 before selling its stake to a Macquarie-led consortium three years later, has deployed more than US$1bil on data centre development in Asia over the past three years.
 The firm would actively invest in additional projects, with a particular focus on Japan and South Korea, said Nikhil Reddy, head of Asia Pacific real estate at GSAM.
 “AI creates a different type of need for data centres beyond the historic demands of the cloud focused on low latency.

679425,StarBiz,16,09/05/2024,DeepMind alumni raise US$200mil funding round for Holistic AI,,"PARIS: Holistic AI, a new startup in Paris working to leapfrog other generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, has closed the first tranche of a US$200mil initial financing round, according to people familiar with the deal.
 Investors agreed to put in US$80mil in equity and US$120mil in convertible debt, chiefly for buying computing power, said the people who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t yet public.
 They said the founding round valued the company at US$370mil.
 The startup, formed by a group of scientists who recently left DeepMind, Google’s artificial intelligence lab, has audacious aims.
 It’s working to develop “multi-agent” models, a process where a number of AI systems interact with one another.
 The deal for the months-old startup marks continued intense interest in companies pushing forward in AI, with investors willing to take a bet on founding teams based on their employment history as much as their proposed product.
 In an investor presentation, the startup described its goal to develop AI with skills like memory, planning, and “tactical decision-making” that AI systems have struggled with.
 “We build genuine AGI capabilities,” read the presentation, referencing theoretical AI systems that outperform humans on all tasks.
 Holistic’s chief executive officer Charles Kantor did not respond to a request for comment.
 Charles Kantor is a former venture resident at Stanford University’s business school. The other four members of the founding team are engineers who spent years at DeepMind working on some of its advanced models.
 Venture firm Accel Partners LP is participating in the round, the people said.
 Other investors include Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google’s former chief executive officer. 
 Business Insider previously reported some of the details of the funding round.
 Accel, a fund based in California, was an early backer of Facebook, Dropbox and several other prominent Internet companies.
 But the firm has steered clear of startups building foundational AI models, such as OpenAI and Mistral, another Parisian newcomer that raced to a US$2bil-plus valuation in its first year.
 In its investor document, Holistic AI pitched a vision of moving “beyond” large language models like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini.
 The document said the startup was planning to target “multiple verticals” and revenue streams.

 The new model, internally referred to as MAI-1, is being overseen by recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the Google DeepMind co-founder and former CEO of AI startup Inflection, the report said, citing two Microsoft employees with knowledge of the effort.The exact purpose of the model has not been determined yet and will depend on how well it performs. Microsoft could preview the new model as soon as its Build developer conference later this month, the report said. Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
 MAI-1 will be “far larger” than the previous smaller, open source models Microsoft had previously trained which means it will be more expensive, according to the report.
 Microsoft last month launched a smaller AI model called Phi-3-mini as it looks to attract a wider client base with cost-effective options.
 The company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and deployed the ChatGPT maker’s technology across its suite of productivity software, allowing it to take an early lead in the generative AI race.
 Microsoft has been setting aside large cluster of servers equipped with Nvidia’s graphic processing units along with large amounts of data to improve the model, according to the report.
 MAI-1 will have roughly 500 billion parameters, the report said, while OpenAI’s GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters and Phi-3 mini measures 3.8 billion parameters.

678693,Main,14,07/05/2024,AI search engine making Parliament debates accessible,,"AN artificial intelligence (AI)-powered search engine has been launched that makes combing through decades of parliamentary records more fruitful  for the public, and which could raise understanding of how  issues evolve in Singapore’s top law-making body.
 Called Pair Search, the website search.pair.gov.sg is powered by a large language model (LLM) – the same technology behind ChatGPT – and also lets users sift through case judgments from the High Court and Court of Appeal.
 Early results from test users of the prototype search engine have been encouraging, said Open Government Products (OGP) senior software engineer Oh Chin Yang.
 OGP is an experimental development arm of the Government that builds technology for the public. The search engine project was conceived at its annual hackathon, as the team felt recent strides in natural language processing and information retrieval could make for a more effective search tool for both public officers and citizens, said Oh.
 “The best public policy decision and debate is an informed one, and that starts with search,” he said.
 Based on data since it was soft-launched at the start of 2024, 84%  of all users who clicked on at least one search result found their searches within the first 10 results shown to them, said Oh, who is one of six members of the Pair product team.
 As at April, there have been approximately 2,700 users on Pair Search for parliamentary records, with a combined total of 8,300 search queries, he added.
 While there is an existing search platform for Hansard – the official record of debates in Parliament – it is “difficult and unintuitive” to use, said the Pair Search team on the OGP hackathon’s website.
 Results were poor as the existing search engine is fully keyword-based, which meant that debates in the House that frequently mentioned a single word in a query were often ranked more highly than more relevant results, it added.
 For instance, it was found that searching for the keywords “Covid-19 rapid testing” using the Hansard search engine led to eight irrelevant documents among the top results.

677481,Main,16,04/05/2024,Digital citizenship in the age of artificial intelligence,,"I REFER to the report “AI basics to be taught at primary schools in 2027” (The Star, March 26). This is indeed the way forward in creating a digital savvy generation.
 Digital literacy is crucial today and in the future to ensure that Malaysia is able to develop local experts in AI, virtual reality, machine learning, prompt engineering and other advanced technologies.
 In the midst of all these exciting developments, one pressing issue that demands our attention is the integrity that needs to be nurtured among those who are using such technologies.
 When the Internet was first introduced in this country, it was embraced by people from all walks of life without much hesitation, giving birth to a thriving digital society.
 Those born in the digital age are called “digital natives” while the others who did not grow up using digital technology are called “digital immigrants”. 
 Both types of digital users have grown by leaps and bounds as the Internet and social media platforms continue to thrive.
 Unfortunately, no one is fully exposed to knowledge in digital citizenship – the responsible use of technology by anyone who uses computers, the Internet, and digital devices to engage with the society on any level. 
 Integrating basic AI must come with the internalisation of good values, such as the use of appropriate language and behaviour when interacting with others to avoid cyberbullying. 
 Primary school students must also be taught to respect the opinions and ideas of others.
 Moreover, they must be exposed to basic intellectual property laws as a measure to discourage plagiarism.
 While developing their skills in AI, students must understand that they cannot use and share other people’s work without permission and, most importantly, they ought to follow the rules and regulations set by every Internet site.
 Without adequate exposure to such codes, technological abuse, particularly through various use of AI such as deepfake, creation of inappropriate sexual materials and blatant plagiarism would be rampant.
 Technological education, undeniably, is a field of study that must be part of the younger generation’s learning process, but it must come with integration of values so that we are not developing the ground for a dystopian society to grow.ZARLINA MOHD ZAMARI

676747,StarBiz,14,02/05/2024,Rising AI demand spurs  Amazon cloud unit sales,Businesses resume spending on technology projects,"WASHINGTON: Amazon.com Inc’s cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, a sign that the retailer’s most profitable unit is recovering from a slump as businesses resume spending on technology projects, including artificial intelligence (AI) services.
 Despite the strong cloud performance, the company’s sales forecast for the current quarter fell short of estimates, reflecting concern about the main eCommerce business as consumers continue to spend cautiously.
 In recent years, chief executive officer Andy Jassy has cut costs and focused on profitability in Amazon’s online shopping business, laying off thousands of people and touting a more efficient warehouse network. 
 At the same time, he’s backed big investments in AI services that Amazon expects to generate tens of billions in revenue in the coming years. Those sales are starting to materialise.
 The Seattle-based company posted a first quarter operating profit of US$15.3bil.
 Revenue increased 13% to US$143.3bil in the period ended March 31, Amazon said in a statement. Both figures topped analysts’ estimates.
 Sales in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit were US$25bil, up 17% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated AWS sales at US$24.1bil.
 “We’re seeing strong demand signals from our customers on the AWS side,” chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters. “They’re signing longer deals with larger commitments, many with generative AI components.” 
 Olsavsky said generative AI now represented a “multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business” for Amazon, the first time the company has publicly put even an approximate figure on that franchise.
 That will come at a cost. AI chatbots, data-crunching tools, and other software that respond to queries from users are possible only thanks to massive quantities of cutting-edge computer chips. 
 Olsavsky said Amazon’s capital expenditures would “meaningfully increase” in 2024, primarily to support AWS growth, including for generative AI. 
 The company has said it will spend more than US$150bil to build out and operate data centres in the coming years.
 Sales growth at the cloud unit had slowed to a record low last year as businesses cut back on technology spending and sought to curb computing bills that ballooned during the pandemic. 
 Investors have been banking on a rebound this year, particularly after strong results last week from Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon’s two main rivals in the business of renting computing power and data storage.
 AWS generated a profit of US$9.42bil in the quarter.
 The unit’s operating margin, which is 37.6%, is the widest since Amazon began disclosing sales for its cloud business. The division held its largest-ever layoffs last year and has continued to trim its ranks selectively, even as it hires in other areas.
 Amazon said revenue will range from US$144bil to US$149bil in the period ending in June. Analysts, on average, projected US$150.2bil. The company’s main eCommerce business reported sales of US$54.6bil in the quarter, slightly missing analysts’ estimates.
 Olsavsky said consumers continue to trade down to save money.
 Shoppers are ordering more consumables, which they need quickly, but they also cost less than other categories, he said.
 That puts pressure on the profitability of the business because Amazon has to process and deliver more units.
 The slowing eCommerce sales have also pushed Amazon to seek greater growth for other business lines. For example, advertising revenue rose 24% to US$11.8bil.
 The results reflect the first quarter since Amazon introduced video advertising to the Prime Video streaming service.
 Amazon shares gained about 2% in extended trading after closing at US$175 in New York.

676767,StarBiz,16,02/05/2024,AMD slides on muted forecast for AI processors,Firm projects MI300 lineup to generate lower sales,"NEW YORK: Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) shares declined as much as 9.1% in extended trading after the chipmaker gave a disappointing forecast for artificial intelligence (AI) processors, a lucrative market now dominated by Nvidia Corp.
 The company projected that its MI300 lineup, a family of so-called AI accelerators, would generate about US$4bil in revenue this year. Though that’s up from an earlier prediction of US$3.5bil, some investors were hoping for as much as US$8bil, according to analysts.
 AMD is seen as a leading contender to challenge Nvidia in the market for accelerators, which help develop chatbots and other tools by bombarding them with data. 
 But it’s playing catch-up in the industry. One challenge has been making enough of the chips to meet demand, chief executive officer Lisa Su said. 
 “We are tight on supply,” she said. “There’s no question that, in the near term, if we had more supply, we have demand.”
 AMD also gave a tepid revenue forecast for the current quarter. Sales will be approximately US$5.7bil in the period, the Santa Clara, California-based firm said. 
 That compares with an average analyst estimate of US$5.72bil. Weak demand for chips used in video game hardware has hampered growth. 
 The shares fell as low as US$143.90 in late trading after the results were released. They had closed at $158.38 on Tuesday, up 7.4% for the year. 
 The AMD report follows a downbeat forecast last week from Intel Corp, which said it expects demand to remain sluggish in the first half of the year. 
 AMD is expecting growth in the range of 6% in the current quarter, better than the roughly flat projection of its larger rival.
 Though Intel is still bigger than AMD in overall sales, it only expects to get about US$500mil in revenue from AI accelerators this year. 
 Nvidia remains far ahead of both companies. Its data centre business is on course to chalk up revenue of US$95.9bil in its current financial year, up two-fold from a year earlier and higher than the total revenue of Intel and AMD combined.
 Su said that the supply constraints with its MI300 line should ease later this year, but they are having an impact in the second quarter. 
 In the first quarter, AMD had earnings of 62 US cents a share, excluding some items, and revenue of US$5.47bil. That performance compared with an estimated 61 US cents in profit and US$5.45bil in sales.
 AMD’s PC chip division had revenue of about US$1.4bil, compared with a US$1.29bil estimate. 
 Data centre sales came in at US$2.3bil, in line with the average projection. Gaming computer-related revenue, meanwhile, was US$922mil. Analysts had expected sales of US$965.5mil.
 Like Intel, AMD still gets most of its revenue from personal computer and server microprocessors. 
 The once-solid server market has been less reliable recently because data centre operators have plowed much of their budgets into Nvidia chips – the very area AMD is now making its own play for.
 Investors betting on AMD’s AI prospects had set off a rally earlier this year, though the stock cooled in recent months. The announcement of a next-generation Nvidia chip has weighed on the shares.
 AMD also competes with Nvidia in the market for graphics processors that improve the images in video games. 
 It’s the biggest rival of Intel in both server and PC processors, as well as in programmable logic chips, which can be reconfigured with software after they’re installed. 
 And it supplies Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp with the main component in their game consoles.
 AMD said that its gross margin – the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production – will be about 53% in the second quarter, matching predictions. — Bloomberg",york micro device amd share extended trading chipmaker forecast artificial intelligence processor market corp company lineup family accelerator bil revenue prediction investor bil analyst contender challenge nvidia market accelerator chatbots tool data catch industry chip demand chief executive officer tight supply question term supply demand tepid revenue current quarter sale period santa clara california firm average analyst estimate bil weak demand chip game hardware growth share low trading tuesday amd report downbeat week intel corp demand sluggish half amd growth range current quarter flat projection larger rival intel bigger amd sale mil revenue accelerator company centre business chalk revenue current financial fold total revenue intel amd supply constraint ease impact quarter quarter amd earnings cent share item revenue performance estimated cent profit bil sale chip division revenue bil bil estimate data centre sale average projection computer revenue mil analyst sale intel amd revenue personal computer server microprocessor server market reliable data centre operator budget nvidia chip play investor amd prospect earlier stock month announcement generation chip share competes market graphic processor image game biggest rival intel server processor programmable logic chip software installed supply corp sony corp main component game gross margin percentage sale cost production quarter prediction,"[(2, 0.16194955), (7, 0.7079785), (12, 0.12567452)]",7
676437,Main,3,01/05/2024,"Youth: Bring on the AI, if it helps us improve our work",,"PETALING JAYA: Most young people do not think that generative artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics would be threats to their jobs in the future, but view such technologies as tools that can help them improve their work.
 Student S. Karelene, 25, said she is quite confident about her job security because being an early childhood educator requires high levels of human interaction, emotional intelligence and creativity.
 “These are not easily (replica­ted) by AI and robotics. I do believe AI may be of assistance in improving processes and conduct, but it would not be much of a threat to my position,” she said in an interview.
 To be a professional and successful educator, especially in early childhood education, the essential elements are patience, strategy and prioritising, she added.“I am keeping myself informed on the latest development in methods to manage students from that age group.
 “Currently, I am juggling work and studies, and I think it helps since I am able to test and apply what I learn in the university on my students. I believe the learning never ends and I plan to keep my mind open to new information and methods.
 “By 2040, I see myself as a successful proprietor of an early childhood centre, preferably one that is specialised in special education. I would like to think that I will also be active in making education a bit more accessible to children in rural areas,” Karelene said.
 A social impact expert, who wanted to be known only as Kamalina, 28, is positive about her job prospects amid the industry shift towards AI integration.
 “Work is changing for sure, yet it still relies on that essential human touch. There’s talk about AI and robots which may affect certain roles differently across industries.
 “In my opinion, they can catalyse job enhancements rather than be replacements. While AI boosts efficiency and productivity, our human oversight is crucial.
 “Some roles may evolve and be more susceptible to automation, and this transformation also brings forth fresh opportunities for growth and innovation,” she said.
 To stay ahead, Kamalina is keen to learn and adapt.
 “It’s a fast-moving world and keeping up keeps us in the game.
 “Overall, I’m feeling pretty good about where we’re headed. What is important is to keep embracing change, recognising that our human skills will always be our strongest asset,” she said.
 Kamalina said she is focused on developing a mix of technical and soft skills.
 “As for technical skills, it is to gain skills in data analysis tools and proficiency in software platforms. I also keep myself updated with digital literacy and technology trends linked to my side role in creative work,” she said.

676529,Main,10,01/05/2024,AI luggage scanners to help fight smuggling,,"PUTRAJAYA: Smuggling will become even harder once artificial intelligence-enabled luggage scanners are placed at all entry points into the country.
 At least 40 of these AI-enabled scanner units will be placed at strategic locations in several states to help detect and prevent smuggling. 
 Customs Department assistant director-general (enforcement) Ribuan Abdullah (pic) said these scanners would be placed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) as well as in Perlis, Kedah, Perak, Penang, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak.
 He explained that the AI technology would assist his personnel in analysing images taken during the scanning process which could help in detecting smuggled items.
 He said the department began using scanners which were equipped with AI at the end of last year at KLIA.
 “These scanners have shown good results and we have made several arrests and seizures, especially on drug smuggling attempts, at KLIA because of it,” he told reporters at the Customs Department headquarters here yesterday.
 He said these scanners were capable of analysing images and colours more clearly.
 “We are also looking at acquiring more cargo scanners which are equipped with drive through multi-view dual energy systems.
 “These high-powered scanners which will be placed at our country’s entry and exit points, like Port Klang, will also help us curb smuggling of drugs and other illicit items,” he said, adding that as of April this year, his department had seized a total of 585.72kg of drugs detected with scanners.
 Ribuan said the department would also be acquiring 20 more drug detecting dogs in June to add to the 20 already being used.
 “In the first quarter of this year, we have detected 1,856 attempted smuggling and evasion of Customs duties with the seizure of RM350.18mil worth of drugs, cigarettes, vehicles, alcohol, textiles and other commodities.
 “We recorded a 181.72% increase in seizures during this quarter when compared to the RM124.3mil of seizures made during the same period last year,” he said, adding that they seized 385 vehicles worth RM27.55mil.
 He said that the vehicles that were seized were mostly luxury vehicles such as Toyata Vellfires, Toyota Alphards and various Mercedes Benz models.
 “Surprisingly, now that the Yamaha RX-Z motorcycle has gained more popularity, we are seeing more of these bikes being seized as they are brought over illegally from neighbouring countries without permits.
 “We believe these motorcycles are brought in either by boat via Sungai Golok or through lorries,” he said, adding that the cases involving smuggling these motorcycles increased when the market value for these motorcycles went up to about RM15,000 for a used one.
 Ribuan said they also opened 711 cases involving the smuggling of 125 million contraband cigarettes worth over RM104.31mil.

676597,Main,19,01/05/2024,Using AI to beat homelessness,,"LAST June, Breanna Sanchez was in trouble: she was behind on the rent, and her landlord in Los Angeles was threatening her family with eviction. But then she was thrown a lifeline, helped by an invisible algorithm.
 Sanchez’s precarious situation had been detected by an artificial intelligence (AI) tool being used as part of an innovative experiment by Los Angeles County to identify residents at risk of losing their homes within 12 months.
 The tool analyses more than 400 factors – including data from the county jail and hospitals, safety net programmes, and homelessness and foster care systems – to create a list of 100,000 people deemed at risk of ending up on the streets.
 Then city officials get to work to deliver counsel and even cash, hoping to stop more from ending up as statistics in a growing nationwide homelessness crisis.
 Sanchez got a letter urging her to contact a county department for housing help. Soon the 33-year-old was talking to an outreach worker, getting signed up for health and other programmes and receiving financial assistance that helped her pay her rent, fix her car and more.
 “I probably would have been evicted,” said Sanchez. “Me and my husband felt stuck and didn’t know how to move forward.”
 The Los Angeles pilot began in 2021 and smaller trials are under way elsewhere as authorities grapple with a homelessness crisis that has led some cities, including Los Angeles, to declare states of emergency.
 Of the hundreds of people the new LA Homeless Prevention Unit has worked with so far, about 87% retained their housing after they left the programme, said Dana Vanderford, associate director of homelessness prevention for the county’s health services department.
 “We often find them in a moment of crisis – we’ll call, and they’ll say, ‘I don’t know how you found me. I’m losing my housing next week and not sure what to do’,” Vanderford said.
 “Our ability to appear out of nowhere and intervene and resolve a crisis – we’re really proud of that,” she said.
 AI is also being used to help predict homelessness risk in Calgary, Canada, and Geoffrey Messier, who is helping with the development of that project, says the LA pilot could be a game-changer.
 “I hope it is a bit of a watershed moment,” said Messier, who is a professor of electrical and software engineering at the University of Calgary. “This is the first time machine-learning was an integral part in identifying people who needed help.”
 More than 653,000 people experienced homelessness in the United States in 2023, a 12% increase over the previous year, according to a US Housing and Urban Development report.
 Janey Rountree, executive director of the California Policy Lab at the University of California in Los Angeles, said recent research showed a one-time cash payment and other services could help stem that tide.
 Last year, the University of Notre Dame published a study that found that at-risk people in California’s Santa Clara County were 81% less likely to become homeless within six months of enrolment in a financial assistance programme.
 “If you get the household at the right moment, give them US$2,000 to US$6,000 (RM9,500 to RM28,500) of assistance to help pay debt or rent, you can put them back on a trajectory toward housing stability,” said Rountree, who helped spearhead the research that led to the creation of the LA pilot and is involved in its evaluation.
 But first local officials have to be able to find those in need, which is where the new AI pilot comes in.
 When an at-risk individual is identified, LA Homeless Prevention Unit case managers, like Jocelyn Bataz, go to work.
 “I call them out of the blue and introduce myself,” she said, explaining that some people are initially sceptical. She reassures them that the call is not a scam and then tries to find out about their housing situation, utility bills and other stresses.
 Within days those eligible can get financial assistance and access to other services to, for example, sort their debts, find childcare or a job and get insurance.
 Bataz said she also provides a lot of emotional support.
 “This is the right way to apply technology – to make sure we’re reaching folks who aren’t otherwise connected to homeless systems but are at risk,” said Alex Visotzky, a California-based senior policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
 AI tools can be more effective than manual approaches to find out who is most chronically in need of housing support, said Stephen Goldsmith, urban policy professor at Harvard University.
 “Because preventing (homelessness) is complex, AI tools can help cities be more effective by focusing necessary services on specific individuals and their needs.”
 AI is also being used in the Canadian city of London, in Ontario, where the homeless population doubled during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Craig Cooper, director of London’s Housing Stability Services, said an AI tool is being used to analyse data from people already in the shelter system to identify who is most at risk and, so far, the model appears highly accurate.
 Similar efforts are under way in Calgary to address the fact that someone new to the shelter system typically has to wait a long time to qualify for housing assistance. But AI can crunch data from the first months in the system to assess longer-term risks.
 “If so, that increases their priority for support,” said Messier, from the University of Calgary.
 In Los Angeles, Sanchez is grateful to have her life back on track just a few months after leaving the programme. Her health concerns are being addressed, she will finish her high school degree in June, and she is expecting a baby.
 “It really helped a lot,” she said of the pilot. “I feel safer here now.” — Reuters",june breanna sanchez trouble rent landlord los angeles family eviction lifeline invisible algorithm sanchez precarious situation artificial intelligence tool innovative experiment los angeles identify resident risk home month tool analysis factor data county jail hospital safety net programme foster care system list people risk street city official counsel cash statistic nationwide homelessness crisis sanchez letter contact county department housing outreach worker health programme financial assistance rent car sanchez husband los angeles pilot trial authority homelessness crisis city los angeles emergency hundred people homeless prevention unit housing programme dana vanderford associate director homelessness prevention county health service department moment crisis call housing week vanderford ability intervene crisis predict homelessness risk canada geoffrey development project pilot game changer bit watershed moment messier professor electrical software engineering university calgary time machine integral identifying people people experienced homelessness united increase previous housing urban development report janey rountree executive director california policy lab university california los angeles time cash payment service tide university notre dame study risk people santa clara county homeless month enrolment financial assistance programme household moment assistance pay debt rent trajectory housing stability creation pilot evaluation local official pilot risk individual homeless prevention unit manager call blue introduce people sceptical reassures scam housing situation utility bill day eligible financial assistance access service sort debt childcare job insurance bataz lot emotional support apply technology folk homeless system risk california senior policy fellow national alliance homelessness tool effective manual approach housing support stephen goldsmith urban policy professor harvard university homelessness complex tool city effective focusing service specific individual canadian city london ontario homeless population covid pandemic craig cooper director housing stability service tool analyse data people system identify risk model accurate effort calgary address shelter system wait time housing assistance crunch data month system ass term risk priority support messier university calgary los angeles grateful life track month programme health concern finish school degree june baby lot pilot feel safer reuters,"[(1, 0.99688774)]",1
676089,Main,4,30/04/2024,Lines blurring between real and AI-made abuse material,,"KUALA LUMPUR: With the greater use of artificial intelligence (AI), it is becoming increasingly difficult for law enforcement to distinguish between ­genuine child sexual abuse cases and AI-generated ones, says Unicef chief of child protection Saskia Blume.
 She said globally, AI is generating child sexual abuse material that appears more realistic.
 Based on Unicef’s Disrupting Harm report, an estimated 100,000 Internet-using children aged 12-17 in Malaysia had experienced instances of online child sexual exploitation and abuse in 2022, she added.
 “The number of children being affected and the material and ­videos being generated, are huge. Now with AI, the lines are blurred, especially when you have child sexual abuse material that involves a real child against the one used to spin off more and more material.
 “So, you don’t know if the child is acutely in danger now versus the old material, so the risk of law enforcement being overwhelmed is really high.
 “AI should be used by law enforcement to go through 100,000 pieces of such material in Malaysia, as it is huge,” she told The Star at the International Symposium on the Empowerment of the Children’s Commission here yesterday.
 Unicef child protection specialist Sivaselvi Supramaniam said industry players can play a role by helping detect Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM).
 Citing the “Safety by Design” proactive and preventative approach that focuses on embedding safety used by the eSafety Commissioner in Australia, she said it is important to start looking at prevention.
 “How can the industry play a role to detect and remove CSEM? Through Safety by Design, for example, technology companies can minimise online threats by anticipating, detecting and eliminating online harm before it occurs.
 “This means at the manufacturing stage of the phone, there are already tools to prevent CSEM from reaching the user.
 “We need to start looking at prevention because the way the Internet works and how chatbots generate images is too fast.
 “We can never keep up so we need to continue to block (harmful) images, we need to look at how we can prevent such images from reaching users,” she added.
 Children’s Commissioner Dr Farah Nini Dusuki said there is much danger to children who have been given access to gadgets for the sake of convenience.
 She said parents still need to communicate about taboo topics as their children are vulnerable to being exploited.
 “I think Malaysian children are very much vulnerable because there is a lack of communication ... between parents and children.
 “How much do parents know about the dangers lurking online, especially with exploitation, and the tools to monitor as well as prevent their children from becoming victims?

675679,StarBiz,12,29/04/2024,"Alphabet, Microsoft earnings show hefty AI bets are driving growth",,"LONDON: Alphabet and Microsoft ignited a rally in technology stocks with earnings that showed big artificial intelligence (AI) investments were driving growth, allaying doubts that their costly bets would take time to pay off after a soft forecast from Meta Platforms.
 Alphabet rose 10%, crossing US$2 trillion in market value with a gain of about US$180bil as it sweetened the pot for investors with its maiden dividend and a US$70bil stock buyback.
 The world’s fourth most valuable firm flirted with the milestone on an intraday basis over three years ago although it never closed above that level, according to LSEG Datastream.
 Microsoft gained nearly 3% and was set to add more than US$80bil to its market value.
 After pouring billions of dollars into the infrastructure needed to support AI applications, both Alphabet and Microsoft reported that their quarterly revenue growth was outpacing expectations as more users turn to services including the Copilot AI assistant and the Gemini chatbot.
 AI services accounted for seven percentage points of the 31% jump in revenue at Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing platform between January and March, finance chief Amy Hood said.
 She added near-term AI demand was a bit higher than the company’s capacity, which held back growth in the quarter and highlighted the need for spending to expand its infrastructure.
 At Google, cloud revenue jumped about 28% with strong growth in Google Workspace, where the Alphabet unit offers a slew of AI features powered by its large language model Gemini.
 The results contrasted with a warning of higher spending and softer-than-expected growth from social media giant Meta, whose stock tumbled 10% last Thursday.
 “This quarter illustrated how demand remains high for generative AI from Microsoft customers, and we continue to believe that Microsoft sits as a leader in this GenAI environment,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.
 “Meta is indicating the results of further increased investment may be years away while Microsoft and Google are showing them right now.”
 The results sparked a rise of 2% in Amazon.com, which will report earnings tomorrow. AI chip stocks Nvidia , Broadcom and Marvell Technology also rose between 1% and 2%, riding on optimism that an ongoing boom in spending by tech giants would power demand for their semiconductors.
 “The three hyperscalers (major cloud companies) we’ve heard from thus far all highlighted a similar message on AI capital expenditure – this is an arms race, the AI opportunity is enormous, and spending will continue to be aggressive or ahead of market expectations,” Bernstein analyst Michael Chiang said.
 Microsoft’s capital expenditures grew by US$300mil from the previous quarter to US$11.5bil, while Alphabet’s capital expenditures were US$12bil, a 91% jump from a year prior.
 At least 19 analysts raised their price target on Alphabet, pushing the median view to US$176.65, compared with its last close of US$156. Microsoft saw 17 price-target increases from analysts, with the median view on the stock now at US$475.
 Microsoft has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.40, compared with Alphabet’s 21.63. — Reuters",london alphabet technology stock earnings artificial intelligence investment growth doubt costly bet time pay soft forecast meta platform market gain bil pot investor maiden dividend bil stock buyback fourth valuable firm intraday basis level lseg datastream microsoft bil market billion dollar infrastructure support application quarterly revenue growth expectation user service copilot assistant gemini chatbot service percentage jump revenue microsoft azure cloud platform january march finance chief amy hood term demand bit company capacity growth quarter spending expand infrastructure google cloud revenue strong growth google workspace alphabet unit slew feature language model gemini spending softer growth social medium giant meta stock thursday quarter demand generative microsoft customer microsoft sits leader genai environment davidson analyst gil luria meta investment microsoft google rise amazon report earnings tomorrow chip stock broadcom marvell technology optimism boom spending tech giant power demand semiconductor hyperscalers major cloud company message capital expenditure arm race opportunity enormous spending aggressive market expectation analyst michael chiang microsoft capital expenditure previous quarter bil capital expenditure jump prior analyst price target median view microsoft price target analyst median view stock microsoft month price earnings ratio alphabet reuters,"[(7, 0.9946346)]",7
675883,Main,9,29/04/2024,STEERING MALAYSIA’S WORKFORCE FOR  A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE,Human Resources Ministry continues to ensure that Malaysia’s workforce can thrive in emerging sectors,"MANPOWER has always been hailed as the backbone of any country, driving its progress, innovation, and economic growth. However, as the landscape of work continues to evolve rapidly, the future of employment is being reshaped by technological advancements, changing market dynamics, and the need for specialised skillsets. 
 In Malaysia, the Human Resources Ministry (Kesuma) plays a vital role in leading the development and management of the nation’s human resources. 
 Kesuma is tasked with the mission to develop and nurture competent, productive, responsive, and resilient human capital in the country’s labour market, ultimately enhancing national productivity.
 The future of work
 The future of work encompasses job sectors anticipated to gain considerable attention or prominence in the coming years, reflecting shifts in labour market dynamics and emerging priorities. 
 Emerging sectors such as sustainable energy, smart infrastructure, data analytics, and cybersecurity are poised to redefine the job market. 
 Roles such as new energy engineers, smart city and smart home architects and engineers, big data analysts, Internet of Things (IoT) experts, and cybersecurity specialists are becoming increasingly essential, promising to shape the future workforce and drive innovation.
 The demand for skilled professionals in these sectors is driven by the urgent need to address global challenges such as climate change, urbanisation, and cybersecurity threats. 
 New energy engineers are tasked with developing sustainable energy solutions, while smart city architects and engineers design interconnected urban environments to enhance efficiency and quality of life. 
 Big data analysts extract valuable insights from large datasets, informing decision-making processes in various industries. 
 IoT experts specialise in designing and implementing interconnected systems, revolutionising industries and enhancing everyday experiences. 
 Meanwhile, cybersecurity specialists safeguard digital infrastructures from cyber threats, ensuring the security and integrity of data in an increasingly interconnected world.
 With these evolving demands for the future job market, Kesuma continuously adapts its strategies and initiatives to ensure that the workforce is equipped with the necessary skills and competencies to thrive in these emerging sectors and contribute to Malaysia’s sustainable development and economic growth.Importance of upskilling and reskillingAmidst the promise of new opportunities, there exists a pressing need for upskilling and reskilling initiatives to bridge the gap between available jobs and the skills of the workforce. 
 Studies reveal concerning trends of underemployment and skills mismatch among young graduates. Many individuals find themselves in jobs that do not align with their field of study or skillset, contributing to high rates of underemployment.
 According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), the underemployment related to skill utilisation rate until October 2023 was 37.4%. 
 Skill mismatch in industries correlates with this. 
 To address this challenge, the government and industries are ramping up efforts to enhance training programmes and educational curricula. They have collaborated to improve the situation by enhancing and building more relevant training programmes for the job market’s needs. 
 Upskilling and reskilling programmes for youths and graduates seeking employment are already underway, aiming to equip individuals with the competencies needed to thrive in the digital economy.
 Malaysia continues to face the impact of increasing technology and automation on the job market. While technology creates new job opportunities, it also raises concerns about job displacement, especially in traditional industries. Reskilling and upskilling programmes aim to address these challenges, preparing the workforce for roles in the digital economy.
 Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programmes play a crucial role in addressing unemployment and skills mismatch, providing individuals with practical skills that are in high demand in the job market. TVET is one method to help strengthen the labour market and enhance the country’s competitiveness in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and beyond.
 Science, Technology, Engineer­ing, and Mathematics (STEM) education, which emphasises technology-related skills and digital literacy, is garnering growing interest from industries, reflecting the increasing demand for technology professionals.
 The government continues to support educational institutions to offer more programmes in this field to address the growing demand for technology professionals. It encourages development of comprehensive reskilling and upskilling programmes focusing on workforce adaptability and inspires individuals to acquire new skills and certifications in response to changing industry demands.
 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s mandate on March 1, 2024 to Kesuma to propose and implement new training initiatives to produce competent workers reinforces the government’s commitment to this cause. 
 Furthermore, to facilitate the transition of higher education and TVET students into the workforce, Kesuma through Talent Corporation Malaysia Bhd (TalentCorp) and HRD Corp, has been mandated to introduce the practical training incentive or ILHAM Kesuma, which was recently announced by Human Resources Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong.
 TalentCorp, an agency under Kesuma established in 2011, drives the nation’s talent strategy towards making Malaysia a dynamic and market-oriented global talent hub. 
 As a think-tank for Kesuma, it is tasked with spearheading research on Artificial Intelligence (AI), digitalisation and workforce sustainability. 
 TalentCorp will also develop the Future Skills Framework for each of the 10 sectors and develop a Future Skills digital platform for workers, institutions, companies, and policymakers to utilise effectively. 
 The aim is to develop frameworks and platforms that support lifelong learning and skills development, ensuring that the workforce remains agile and resilient in the face of change. 
 In addition, there is mynext by TalentCorp, an all-in-one talent solution and analytics platform for students, universities, companies, and the workforce. It supports students and individuals of the workforce by providing access to profiling tools that help them discover their work value, and interests, most employable traits and connect them directly to ideal internship opportunities. 
 As of December 31, 2022:	> 233,556 students were profiled for the workforce with 10,656 companies; 			> For the National Structured Internship programme (MYSIP), there were 111,326 internship placements; 			> Under the Semester Break Programme (SBP), there were 5,670 registered students with 19,693 live views on Zoom and Facebook Live across the 89 sessions organised. The SBP targets Malaysian students returning home for holidays, aiming to familiarise them with Malaysia’s key economic sectors through meetings with industry leaders, experts, and visits to iconic infrastructure projects.
 Findings for future planning
 The World Economic Forum report emphasises that the future of work landscape is influenced by dynamic and complex factors. Based on the 2023 trend study, the economy, health, and geopolitics have affected the shape of the global labour market.
 According to an online job search and career development site, Zippia’s research indicates that by 2030:			> 85% of current jobs will not exist in 2030;			> The automation sector has the potential to eliminate 47% of jobs (in the United States), equivalent to 73 million jobs	;		> 37% of workers will work from home.
 These findings lead to drastic changes in the education sector to produce graduates who can meet market demands.
 The Critical Occupations List (MyCOL) 2022/2023 TalentCorp report also highlights several challenges that need attention. These include:			> Shortage of skilled workers;	> Mismatch of jobs with fields of study;				> Difficulty in retaining talent.
 Kesuma continues to monitor such findings for future planning and management of the workforce.
 Labour Day celebration
 The upcoming Labour Day celebration on May 1 will be officiated by Anwar and attended by over 3,000 workers from various unions, statutory bodies, public, and private sectors at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre.
 Anwar is scheduled to present several Labour Day awards at the gathering as a gesture of appreciation for the contributions of workers to the nation’s development. 
 This year, 12 awards will be conferred to workers, employers, unions, media, and contingents. In addition, the premier will also launch the Human Resources Policy Framework 2030.
 About 20 activities have been planned in conjunction with the Labour Day celebrations, such as four Pocket Talk Series, Labour Day Run, Occupational Safety and Health Practitioners Gathering, Perdana Forum, and Career Carnival offering 10,000 job opportunities and exhibitions by government departments and agencies. 
 These programmes aim to raise awareness among the public about workers’ and employers’ rights and responsibilities, job opportunities, and technical skills courses offered to youths.

675901,Lifestyle,4,29/04/2024,Addressing homelessness with AI,"A US city is using artificial intelligence to spot homeless encampments, sparking a debate on technology’s role  in social issues.","Across the United States, cities have begun experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) to map potholes, reduce traffic and fight wildfires. In San Jose, officials are now harnessing the rapidly evolving technology with another goal in mind: detecting homeless encampments.
 Three times since December, a white city-owned Toyota sedan affixed with a half-dozen small cameras has cruised through South San Jose to collect footage of parked cars and RVs (recreational vehicles). The images were then fed into different AI systems developed by four private companies to determine whether people were living inside the vehicles.
 The open-ended pilot programme, thought to be the first of its kind nationwide, may soon also seek to identify tent encampments and could one day expand to a permanent fleet of vehicles that crisscross the city.
 While homeless advocates fear the effort could lead to more encampment sweeps and impounded lived-in RVs, city officials say they are optimistic it will help connect homeless people with needed services, shelter or housing.
 The programme is not designed to collect identifying footage of licence plates or people’s faces, officials stressed.“We’re not interested in the individual identities of people who are living outside,” said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan. “But we do need to know where all the lived-in vehicles in the city are so that we can manage them.”
 The programme, first made public by The Guardian, comes as Mahan pushes to “end the era of encampments” as residents have grown increasingly frustrated with street homelessness.
 At the mayor’s urging, the City Council agreed earlier this year to develop policies to ban RVs near schools, restrict oversized-vehicle parking across the city, and establish new tow-away zones. The city estimates it has more than 800 lived-in RVs.
 At the same time, city officials are devising plans to move around 1,000 homeless people from local waterways and into shelters. San Jose has an estimated 6,300 homeless residents, about 70% of whom live outdoors or in vehicles. The rest stay in shelters.
 In addition to responding to encampments, San Jose’s pilot programme aims to help identify trash, graffiti, potholes and parking violations. Other cities already use AI for those purposes, but San Jose appears to be the first to employ the technology to spot RVs or tents with people living inside, according to AI experts and national homeless advocates.
 Tami Rule moved into an RV parked in a residential area near Highway 87 and Capitol Expressway last year after a fire destroyed the apartment she shared with her husband in San Jose’s West San Carlos neighbourhood.
 Rule, 56, said her biggest concern about the programme is people gawking at footage of the plastic bins filled with clothes and shoes, small potted plants and other belongings the couple keeps stacked outside their vehicle.
 “But for somebody to understand what it’s like to live in a camper,” she said. “I wouldn’t mind that.”
 Elsewhere in the Bay Area, San Francisco, Oakland, Fremont and Mountain View officials said they had no plans to use AI to track encampments.
 Still, experts said it’s not hard to imagine cities following San Jose’s lead. Last month, Mahan hosted officials from the White House and local governments across the country for a virtual forum on using AI to improve public services.
 Vishnu Pendyala, an AI professor and researcher at San Jose State University, said the technology has “huge potential” for detecting homeless camps. But he also noted the privacy concerns surrounding the pilot programme and other fledgling AI efforts.“We have already seen many things being hacked and many things being misused,” Pendyala said. He pointed to reports of Apple contractors allegedly listening to recordings of iPhone users’ queries to Siri, a program powered by AI.
 Officials from the city and the companies working on the pilot said that protecting people’s privacy is a top priority – in part by explicitly instructing AI systems to ignore faces and licence plate numbers.
 “Whether we like it or not, AI is going to be a dominant technology,” said Khaled Tawfik, San Jose’s chief information officer. “We want to be the leaders in discovering the risk and finding ways to mitigate it.”
 Tawfik said his department is not sharing any information with other local agencies or the police department during the pilot, and any data or footage distributed in the future would obscure identifying details.
 San Jose started the programme, which is currently limited to South San Jose’s Council District 10, in response to the thousands of 311 calls it receives each year to report vehicles that appear abandoned, Tawfik said. He said the city aims to proactively identify which vehicles have people living in them so officials know where to send homeless outreach teams.
 So far, the pilot has identified lived-in RVs with about 70% accuracy. It recognised lived-in cars correctly only about 10% to 15% of the time.
 Masaf Dawood, a vice president with San Mateo-based Xloop Digital, one of the companies involved in the pilot, expects those numbers to improve as the AI analyses thousands more images.He said this is the first time a city has asked the company to identify lived-in vehicles. Xloop Digital’s software looks for markers, including litter on the roadway, lines of parked RVs, and unexpected objects, such as a coffee maker on a vehicle dashboard.
 Despite the technology’s potential, Dawood still anticipates a margin of error. “I don’t think we can say, or that we should say, ‘Oh, we can be 100%’,” he said.
 The other companies that have taken part in the pilot are Sensen.AI, CityRover and Mountain View-based Blue Dome Technologies.
 Todd Langton, executive director of the homeless advocacy group Agape Silicon Valley, worries the programme could “turbo charge” the city’s push to move RVs off its streets.Langton said towing unhoused people’s vehicles not only takes their shelter but often forces them to part with personal belongings, important documents or medication, potentially exacerbating any mental health and drug issues.
 Many residents, meanwhile, want the city to take a tougher stance on vehicle and tent encampments. Students at KIPP San Jose Collegiate, a high school in East San Jose, pressured city officials to move forward with the RV ban near schools, saying homeless people have broken into school buildings and left needles on lunch tables.
 As San Jose officials ramp up enforcement, they say they want to ensure homeless people have safe places to go. They point to recent efforts to build hundreds of tiny home shelters and open safe overnight parking lots with supportive services.
 Even so, those solutions aren’t coming fast enough, Langton said. The city still lacks enough beds for everyone on the street, and with a severe shortage of affordable housing, most people who move through local shelters don’t find lasting homes.
 “It’s just a drop in the bucket of what needs to be done,” Langton said. – Bay Area News Group/Tribune News Service",united city artificial intelligence map pothole traffic fight san jose official technology goal mind homeless encampment time white city toyota sedan half dozen camera south san jose collect footage car rv recreational vehicle image system private company people inside vehicle programme nationwide seek identify tent encampment day permanent fleet vehicle city homeless advocate effort lead encampment sweep lived rv city official optimistic connect homeless people service housing programme collect identifying footage licence people official individual identity people san jose mayor matt mahan vehicle city manage programme public guardian mahan push era resident grown frustrated street homelessness mayor city council earlier policy rv school oversized vehicle city tow zone city estimate rv time city official plan homeless people local waterway shelter homeless resident outdoors vehicle stay shelter addition encampment san jose pilot programme trash graffiti pothole violation city san jose employ technology spot rv tent people expert national homeless tami rule residential highway capitol fire apartment husband san jose west san carlos neighbourhood rule biggest concern programme people footage plastic bin clothes shoe plant belonging couple vehicle understand camper mind bay san francisco oakland fremont mountain view official track encampment expert city jose lead month official white house local government country virtual forum public service vishnu pendyala professor researcher san jose university technology huge potential homeless camp privacy concern pilot programme effort misused pendyala report apple contractor recording iphone user query program official city company people top priority system licence plate dominant technology tawfik san jose chief officer leader risk mitigate tawfik department local agency department pilot data footage future obscure identifying detail jose south san jose council district response thousand receives report vehicle tawfik city identify vehicle people official homeless outreach team lived rv accuracy lived car time masaf dawood vice president mateo xloop digital company pilot thousand image time city company lived vehicle digital software marker litter roadway line rv unexpected object coffee maker vehicle dashboard technology potential dawood anticipates error company sensen view blue dome technology langton executive director homeless advocacy agape silicon valley worry turbo charge city push rv street unhoused people vehicle shelter force personal belonging document medication mental health drug issue resident city stance vehicle tent student san jose collegiate school east san jose pressured city official ban school homeless people broken school building needle lunch table jose official enforcement homeless people safe effort hundred tiny shelter safe overnight lot supportive service solution langton city bed street severe shortage affordable housing people local shelter home drop bucket langton bay news tribune news service,"[(0, 0.545386), (8, 0.45233193)]",0
675527,Main,18,28/04/2024,AI and  the gig economy deliver an opportunity,"Ahead of Labour Day on Wednesday,  these academics look at the future of work.","NEW tech such as generative AI is reshaping how we live and work.
 Young professionals with digital skills stand to cash in on the inevitable changes AI will bring to the job market. Emerging nations, which can recognise these changes and arm their workforce with those same skills, can ride the wave too. 
 Researchers forecast a shift towards knowledge-intensive activities, with jobs such as statisticians and software engineers, critical to the development of artificial intelligence systems, being the ones in demand. 
 They anticipate that employment prospects will increasingly revolve around computing, research, system management, law, engineering, health, architecture and education.
 The people doing these jobs are evolving as well. The idea of a graduate leaving university with one set of skills and relying on those skills to stay relevant for 40 years is over. 
 No longer tied to an office desk in the city, they are gig workers, freelancers and digital nomads, working from home, the local cafe or wherever there is a reliable internet connection. Although all types of independent workers share elements of independence and flexibility in their working arrangements, they differ in terms of lifestyle, the nature of their work and their relationship with employers or clients. 
 Gig workers typically perform short-term tasks or projects, and their work is not necessarily location-independent. Freelancers are self-employed and offer their services to clients. They may work remotely, but can also work on-site if required. 
 Digital nomads use technology to work remotely and live a location-independent lifestyle. The digital nomad visa is new because of this lifestyle.
 Emerging economies are beginning to cash in on these styles of work. The growing gig economy offers chances for individuals in numerous developing nations to make money, develop fresh skills and connect with professional networks.
 A proliferation of new platforms worldwide catering to specialised industries, along with local platforms addressing country-specific demands for both skilled and low-skilled workers, are transforming the global workforce. 
 Around 12% of the global labour market consists of gig workers. There are 545 online gig work platforms worldwide (three-quarters are regional or local), with clients and workers from 186 countries. Forty percent of traffic to gig platforms comes from low- and middle-income countries. 
 Asian nations are seizing the chance offered by online outsourcing and remote gig work to generate millions of job opportunities for their people. 
 The pool of professional gig workers predominantly hails from lower-income countries. 
 India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, for example, are home to millions of professionals who offer services in web and software development, graphic design, content writing and digital marketing. India alone has around 15 million gig workers in human resources, IT and design.
 Meanwhile, the number of freelancers worldwide has reached 1.57 billion (47% of the global workforce). The freelance industry in the United States has grown by 78% to 73.3 million. This is expected to rise to 76.4 million by 2024, with AI creating new opportunities.  
 One study shows that 84% of freelancers live their preferred lifestyle and 70% claim that they choose to work as freelancers to improve work-life balance. 
 The United States, India and the Philippines stand out as major contributors to the freelance workforce, with Japan emerging as one of the top 10 countries experiencing freelancer growth. 
 While freelancers in the US primarily secure gig work from local clients, those in developing nations like India, Pakistan and the Philippines rely heavily on overseas clients, accounting for approximately 90% of their assignments. This dynamic presents significant opportunities for job creation, reduced unemployment, and economic advancement in these countries.
 Digital nomads now number around 17 million in the US. Indeed, the US accounts for about half of the digital nomad community worldwide. It is predicted that by 2027, more than half the US workforce will participate in the gig economy. 
 This growth offers an array of opportunities for gig workers and employers alike. The number of online communities and professional networks providing support, networking opportunities, and a sense of community for gig workers is on the rise.
 Having access to the external workforce is important for finding rare skills such as blockchain development, quantum computing, sustainable fashion design, machine learning, statistical modelling, data visualisation, ethical hacking, and threat detection. An increasingly AI-reliant economy underscores the importance of continual reskilling and upskilling for the workforce to remain relevant. 
 With strategic investments in infrastructure and training, emerging and developing countries can harness AI to compete in the global market and attract employers. 
 AI-driven platforms have the potential to provide tailored training designed specifically for individuals. These platforms can deliver personalised learning experiences and recommend relevant courses, tutorials, or resources to strengthen candidates’ abilities and improve their chances of securing employment.
 Additionally, AI will empower individuals with disabilities to utilise their professional skills, integrating them into the country’s talent pools and expanding their opportunities for accessing professional jobs through online platforms.
 Future employees will need diverse skills, including problem-solving, data analysis, collaboration, communication, relationship-building, and judgment. The education system needs to adapt to produce these workers. 
 For developing economies, the key lies in establishing a solid foundation through investment in digital infrastructure and nurturing a digitally proficient workforce that can leverage AI for optimum productivity. 
 As for income inequality, job polarisation and unemployment, they are intricately linked to the impact of AI on labour economics. How AI will cause unemployment depends on how quickly people learn the needed new skills (upskilling and reskilling). The faster markets adapt, the less unemployment there’ll be. 
 There is concern about the potential job displacement caused by generative AI, raising questions about its impact, especially in high-skilled sectors. 
 However, despite this, high-skill workers have seen improved employment opportunities post-AI emergence. AI exposure correlates with increased job growth in occupations requiring extensive computer use, indicating higher skill levels. There is also a growing concern that AI benefits may disproportionately favour a select few individuals or businesses, exacerbating income disparities. 
 Skilled professionals proficient in building, implementing, and managing AI systems may witness increased demand and higher wages, while low-skilled workers may face stagnant pay and reduced job prospects. — 360info™

675187,Main,5,27/04/2024,AI content must not cross the line,Concerns over the tech being misused in by-elections,"PETALING JAYA: Advanced chatbots and apps have made it easier for even the most novice of content creators to generate election campaign materials, but this has also caused concerns of artificial intelligence (AI) being misused.
 Some content creators claim that the toxic and defamatory AI-generated content during election campaigns is usually not party-­endorsed but made voluntarily by party “vigilantes”.
 Content creator Ramli Ali said even before ChatGPT became popular, he had been using AI to assist him in creating visuals of politicians.
 “For political campaigning, AI content can be generated easily. All you have to do is request whatever you want from the app.
 “Then, you just have to add finishing touches to the images and your watermark to make it yours.
 “AI-generated content is legal. The question is whether the content is ethical or morally acceptable to all parties.
 “Election campaigns can be very vicious, with personal attacks and defamatory remarks. We content creators have to be careful to ensure that we do not cross the line.
 “Professional content creators know the moral lines not to be crossed,” said Ramli, adding that most content creators using AI-generated content work in the shadows.
 (While AI-generated content is still legal, there are many lawsuits going on in the United States and Europe, filed by creators who say their copyrighted works were used without their permission to “train” AI tools).
 Another content creator, who wanted to be known only as Tan, said creators have to be quick but creative to make sure their content is effective during election campaigns.
 “Time is short during by-elections. The defensive content is what we have to come up with instantly. There is no time to waste, or the rival will have the upper hand,” he said.
 Tan said the “cheap and defamatory ones” are not done by content creators but by party supporters who get ahead of themselves and do not follow any guidelines.
 While AI content is being used to vie for voter attention, political party leaders in charge of social media campaigning for the Kuala Kubu Baharu by-election said content creators cannot do as they please.
 PKR information chief Fahmi Fadzil, who is also Communications Minister, said he will not hesitate to crack the whip on those who misuse AI to propagate hate.
 “There are many scams which mislead the people, apart from those posts that defame and spread lies,” he said.
 He added that the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has been directed to take action against these.
 Umno supreme council member Datuk Seri Ahmad Maslan said the party has a special team of lawyers monitoring content posted by its rivals, including parties in the government, during campaigning.
 “We have a team headed by information chief Datuk Seri Azalina Othman,” he said when contacted, referring to the Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institu­tional Reforms).
 An Umno official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the party has guidelines that any materials used in attacking rivals must not be unethical or breach the law.
 DAP national publicity secretary Teo Nie Ching had also said that she believes there will be more fake accounts impersonating party candidates or leaders to spread disinformation and hate speech during the Kuala Kubu Baharu by-election.
 “Pang Sock Tao’s candidacy was announced on Wednesday. ­Yester­day, someone used her ­photos to create a fake account on Facebook,” she said.
 Teo, who is also Deputy Commu­nications Minister, said with the help of AI, generating content has become easy.
 Selangor PAS information chief Zurk Ahmad said the party is very careful with what its content ­creators post on social media as it has many political enemies.
 “Among the guidelines given to content creators are that all content must be in line with party principles, uphold people’s priorities, and be based on facts, not perceptions.
 “PAS uses AI on a small scale to assist our campaigners and party volunteers to speed up their production.
 “Overall, PAS uses more ‘human intelligence’, using big data analysis and data engineering that is geared towards information. PAS has a specific workforce for each task,” he added.
 Zurk said the party also constantly monitors all social media platforms on any issue that has to do with PAS.
 “We have a legal team that is always prepared to take action should there be political exaggeration,” he said.",jaya chatbots easier novice content creator election campaign material concern artificial intelligence content creator toxic defamatory content election campaign party party vigilante content creator ramli ali chatgpt popular assist visuals politician political campaigning content request app add touch image content legal question content ethical acceptable party election vicious personal attack defamatory remark content creator careful cross professional content creator moral line ramli content creator content shadow content legal lawsuit europe creator permission train tool content creator tan creator creative content effective election campaign time short election defensive content time waste rival upper hand tan cheap defamatory content creator party supporter guideline content vie voter attention political party leader social medium kuala baharu election content creator chief fahmi fadzil communication minister crack whip misuse propagate hate scam people post spread lie malaysian communication commission action umno supreme council seri ahmad maslan party special team lawyer content rival party government team chief datuk seri othman minister prime minister department law tional reform official speaking condition anonymity party guideline material rival unethical breach law national publicity secretary teo fake account party candidate leader disinformation hate speech kuala kubu baharu election pang sock tao candidacy wednesday day photo fake account facebook teo deputy commu nications minister content easy selangor pa chief zurk ahmad party careful content creator social medium political enemy guideline content creator party principle uphold people priority perception scale assist campaigner party volunteer production pa human intelligence data analysis data engineering pa specific workforce task zurk party social medium platform pa legal team action political exaggeration,"[(5, 0.9960601)]",5
674792,StarBiz,10,26/04/2024,AI memory boom propels SK Hynix’s numbers,Company reports doubling in quarterly sales,"Seoul: SK Hynix Inc says it expects a full recovery in the memory market, led by surging demand related to artificial intelligence (AI), and lifted its capital spending plans.
 The leader in the high-bandwidth memory that powers Nvidia Corp’s AI accelerators declared it has entered a rebound phase, after posting its fastest pace of revenue growth since 2010, and said it’s preparing bigger outlays to expand capacity of its leading-edge chips.
 The world’s tech companies are locked in a race to supply components essential to creating generative AI services. SK Hynix earlier said it’s investing some US$15bil in South Korea to meet surging demand for such high-end chips, on top of a plan to spend US$3.9bil on an advanced packaging plant and research centre for AI products in Indiana. 
 The company said it’s increasing the supply of its leading-edge HBM3E chips and in talks with a number of customers on long-term contracts for such semiconductors.
 Overall memory demand is also on a steady growth path, it said, citing double-digit price rises in the broader DRAM market and a rebound in NAND prices. 
 That more than doubled the world’s No. 2 memory maker’s quarterly sales, the company’s fastest pace of revenue expansion in over a decade, while operating profit blew past estimates.
 Shares in SK Hynix, which have gained 27% this year, fell 3.9% during trading yesterday in Seoul, part of a broader selloff in Asian equity markets following Meta Platforms Inc’s weak outlook. Bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co shed 2.3%.
 The company’s capacity for high-end memory is fully booked for this year and it needs new factories to keep up with the demand, said Tom Kang, director at Counterpoint Research. SK Hynix is expected to hit revenue of almost 61 trillion won and a profit margin of more than 20% this year, he said. 
 “This is a clear turnaround and the start of a record breaking year for SK Hynix,” he said. The company has said it expects demand for high-end memory to grow 60% a year.
 Strong demand for AI server products is also helping to bolster prices of DRAM. Demand for enterprise solid-state drives helped SK Hynix’s NAND business return to profitability in the first quarter, according to chief operating officer Kim Woo Hyun, who spoke on an earnings call. 
 Investment in 2024 will be slightly higher than planned at the start of the year, with the bulk of spending to focus on high-margin products and infrastructure for medium-term growth, Kim said.
 “Any impact on near-term supply and demand of conventional products will be limited,” he said. “We will  balance investing in future growth with ensuring financial soundness, given our current level of cash generation.”
 In the March quarter, SK Hynix reported a higher-than-expected revenue of 12.4 trillion won, up 144% from a year ago. 
 Operating income was 2.89 trillion won, its second-highest first-quarter operating profit on record and outperforming estimates of 1.8 trillion won. 
 SK Hynix is reporting days after Texas Instruments Inc gave a bullish revenue forecast for the current quarter, indicating that a slump in demand for industrial and automotive components may be easing. 
 Samsung’s preliminary operating profit also showed a sharp rebound in the first quarter, while Micron Technology Inc last month gave a strong sales forecast.
 SK Hynix has been fighting to keep its lead over Samsung, which has pledged to focus its formidable resources on catching up in high-end memory. 
 The newest SK Hynix factory will be built near its existing production base in Cheongju. Separately, SK Hynix is proceeding with other domestic investments including in the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster, where it’ll ultimately inject about 120 trillion won.

673982,Main,8,23/04/2024,AI portal to take on scammers,"More emphasis needed to combat misinformation and fake news, says minister","PUTRAJAYA: A portal using artificial intelligence (AI) will be ­created to help people verify the information they receive, repel defamatory news and fight fraud or scams, says Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil.
 The portal, he said, would be expanded from the special segment Biar Betul! that is broadcast on RTM, as the segment – which is less than a minute long – was insufficient and needed to be revved up to deal with the issue, Bernama reported.
 “It is still in the early stages but there is a need so that people in general do not have to doubt the material they read. If there is any doubt, they can refer (to the portal).
 “Today we can watch Biar Betul! on various platforms including on RTM where scam material and fake and defamatory content are exposed every day, but we see that it is not enough and needs to be improved,” he said after launching the Jom Baca Bersama 10 Minit programme at the Communications Ministry here yesterday.
 According to Fahmi, the new platform will strengthen the capabilities of existing platforms such as Sebenarnya.my under the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and MyCheck.my managed by the Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama), as well as Biar Betul!, to make it easier for people to search for and verify any information they receive.
 Fahmi said the ministry will also work with social media platforms so that information received by users goes through a process as practised on the X platform (formerly Twitter) that allows users to attach “Community Notes” to a post.
 In addition, a total of 1,878 “Madani communities” across the country can also be used as Biar Betul! agents as the front line to fend off defamation, correct perceptions and check facts with the ministry to ensure that the  delivery of information to the community is done more clearly and in an organised manner, he added.
 Fahmi said the matter is being taken seriously since MCMC information showed that almost 80% of the content downloaded until April was of a scam nature, including advertising fraud and online gambling.
 Earlier, in his speech, he said the theme of the Jom Baca Bersama 10 Minit programme, “Reading Preserves Unity”, is very much in line with the Madani concept that reflects the emphasis on building a civilised society, giving each other insight and fostering unity.
 Organised jointly by the Communications Ministry’s Resource Centre and the Infor­mation Department’s Resource and Photo Centre, the programme was held in conjunction with World Book and Copyright Day, celebrated worldwide on April 23 every year.

673234,StarBiz,9,22/04/2024,Lenovo teams up with US chip giants for AI PCs,,"BEIJING: Chinese technology company Lenovo Group Ltd is partnering with US chip giants such as Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc to develop artificial intelligence (AI) PCs, or computers with on-device AI, to meet the growing demand for smarter productivity tools.
 Lenovo, which launched China’s first batch of AI PCs in Shanghai last Thursday, said the machines could automatically build artwork presentations and synthesise knowledge based on stored documents. They suit a range of users, from primary school students to scientists working in Antarctica.
 Yang Yuanqing, chairman of Lenovo, said the transition of AI from technological breakthroughs to practical applications marks the beginning of the second half of AI’s development.
 Yang said it is highly important to accumulate user feedback and continuously improve AI technology through real-world applications.
 He highlighted the demanding computational requirements for AI-powered PCs, and envisioned a future where every individual possesses a personal intelligent entity that can seamlessly integrate into PCs or smartphones.

673338,Main,5,22/04/2024,Students rely heavily on AI to excel in coursework,,"PETALING JAYA: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools such as ChatGPT has become increasingly popular among students. They find that it is quick to provide and compile information as well as simple to use.
 Software engineering diploma student Vincent Ong, 21, said the use of AI writing tools for research has become the norm among most of his friends and peers.
 “We mainly use it as a research model to find information, but I personally still find information from actual sources for comparison. The use of AI just makes all the tedious work of finding information from various sources and summarising it so much faster while also providing details that I was not aware of before,” he said.
 Ong added that while useful, AI writing tools should not be used to do an entire assignment or coursework.
 Information and communication technology (ICT) diploma student Jordan Lim, 20, said the use of AI is becoming popular just like the search engine Google among his classmates.
 “We use it very frequently and pretty much for everything as the explicit answers and information it provides are usually more ­thorough than those found in indivi­dual articles online. It helps explain certain parts or derive answers for topics that I struggle in, though we do not copy an entire assignment based on the answers it provides,” Lim said.
 Journalism degree student Christian Chung, 21, said using AI has become common among his peers and friends to generate ideas for their coursework.
 “AI writing tools give a good starting point for us to build on as they are much faster at finding and compiling relevant information. They also help me to identify informative relevant links to what I’m writing on,” he said.
 Chung added that while using AI writing tools for an entire assignment would be unethical, the generated content and information from such tools are fair game as long as they meet assignment requirements.
 However, a 22-year old ICT student, Hazeeq, expressed concern over AI as some of his coursemates use it during exams.
 “Using ChatGPT has become a daily routine for them when it comes to all coursework, from assignments to quizzes and even during exams at times.
 “I’m worried that some of my friends could become lazy and just depend entirely on AI writing tools to solve not just their coursework, but also other matters,” he said.
 Hazeeq said while he does not use AI to that extreme, he uses it often to help him learn better. He said AI helps to generate ideas and identify issues in his coding coursework.
 “When I run out of ideas for a website, ChatGPT helps generate sample code ideas for me to start from, while highlighting and explaining my coding errors clearly so I don’t make the same mistakes again,” he added.",jaya artificial intelligence writing tool popular student quick compile simple software engineering diploma student vincent writing tool norm friend peer actual source comparison tedious finding source detail aware ong writing tool entire assignment coursework communication technology ict diploma student jordan lim popular search engine google pretty explicit answer dual article derive answer topic copy entire assignment answer journalism degree student christian chung common peer friend idea writing tool build relevant identify informative relevant link chung writing tool entire assignment unethical content tool fair game meet assignment requirement ict student hazeeq concern exam chatgpt daily routine coursework assignment exam time worried friend lazy writing tool coursework matter extreme learn idea issue coursework idea chatgpt sample code idea error mistake,"[(10, 0.99188066)]",10
673340,Main,5,22/04/2024,Balancing academic integrity and AI,"The technology has a place in education but needs proper integration, say experts","PETALING JAYA: It’s been a year since plagiarism detection platform Turnitin launched its artificial intelligence (AI) writing detec­tion feature, and its findings are astonishing.
 Of more than 200 million papers reviewed as at March 21 this year, over 22 million or about 11% had at least 20% of AI writing present.
 More surprisingly, over six million or approximately 3% of the over 200 million papers reviewed had at least 80% AI writing, Turnitin said in a recent statement.
 The detection feature integrates the AI writing report within the existing Turnitin workflow, providing educators with an overall percentage of the document that AI writing tools, like the ever-popu­lar ChatGPT, may have gene­rated.
 Turnitin said the consistent presence of AI writing in their data highlighted a continued need to view the use of AI writing tools in education as a “complex, ever-evolving puzzle”.
 “Educators and institutions should look at various factors, or puzzle pieces, beyond detection.
 “This includes open discussions with students regarding accep­table uses of AI writing in the classroom, reviewing academic policies and revising essay prompts,” it said.
 Turnitin chief product officer Annie Chechitelli said it is an important juncture in education where technologies transform learning and academic integrity is at stake.
 “Everyone in education is loo­k­ing for resources to enable them to perform at their best, as well as technologies, including our AI writing detection feature, to help advance learning without sacrificing academic integrity,” she said in the same statement.
 Turnitin also cited a recent study finding that nearly all students surveyed had used generative AI tools such as ChatGPT monthly, weekly or daily.
 “The survey found that 75% of those surveyed say they will continue to use the technology even if faculties or institutions ban them,” it said, noting generative AI usage’s growth over the past year with more to come.
 With this revelation, tertiary institutions say that educating students on the ethical use of said technology is crucial.
 Noting that AI usage in education is not entirely a “bad thing”, they said that integrating it into the curriculum and research could better prepare students for a future where the technology is integrated into jobs.
 Vice-Chancellors’ Council for Private Universities chairman Prof Mushtak Al-Atabi pointed out the paradox of AI in education, highlighting the potential to both simplify and complicate ­academic assessment.
 He also noted how the advancement of AI tools could make the simplicity of copying and pasting assignments more tempting for students.
 “This challenge compels institutions to adopt more human-­centric assessment methods.
 “The future may see students not merely submitting written work but also defending their ideas before panels of experts, ensuring a deeper engagement with their studies and a move away from rote learning.
 “These experts could be drawn from the industry, further enhan­cing the link between academia and real life and improving the employability prospects for students,” he said to The Star.
 Prof Mushtak, who is also the Heriot-Watt University Malaysia provost and CEO, said plagiarism is often not a sign of laziness but a symptom of students failing to see value in their educational journey.
 “They prioritise grades over learning, perhaps because the rele­vance of their studies to the real world is not apparent.
 “The antidote is to cultivate a deep sense of purpose in students and explicitly connect the skills they are learning to the impacts they wish to make in the world,” he said.
 On the flipside, Prof Mushtak said AI could play a transformative role when it comes to educators’ schedules.
 “A significant portion of academic time is consumed by administrative duties, grading, and other tasks that, while necessary, do not directly contribute to inspiring students or enhancing learning.
 “By automating routine tasks, AI can free educators to focus more on mentoring, coaching and truly engaging with their students,” he said.
 Sunway Education Group chief executive officer Prof Datuk Elizabeth Lee said they had ­seve­ral measures in place to mitigate the use of AI. This includes academic staff trained to use ­generative AI in teaching and learning and at the same time detect irresponsible use of it.
 “Clear guidelines are in place for staff and students to iterate expectations on boundaries or limitations towards using ­AI-­gene­rative tools in their formative and summative assessments,” she said.
 Prof Lee, however, added that the group had encouraged the use of AI writing tools since ChatGPT was launched.
 “Students must be taught to understand the limitations and boundaries between fair and unfair AI use,” she said.
 Prof Lee said it isn’t solely about minimising AI use, but instead, preparing students for a future where AI-generative tools become job-integrated.
 “It is also important for us to promote responsible and ethical AI use,” she said, adding that AI can complement and enhance human abilities.
 Prof Lee said the continuous evolution of AI has encou­raged academicians to stay upda­ted and rethink assessments of relevant learning outcomes.
 “We cannot avoid how AI should be seen as a tool for augmenting ability and overcoming challenges.
 “Resisting its usage will further enhance the gap between higher education provision and what students are taught as well as skills on demand in future job markets.
 “Integrating AI into curriculum and research can better prepare our students,” she said.
 Malaysian Association of Pri­vate Colleges and Universities (Mapcu) president Datuk Parmjit Singh said AI writing tools are a positive evolution in technology for education.
 “Incorporating them within the correct ethical utilisation is the way forward as AI tools, just like the scientific calculator in 1972, are here for a positive impact and will coexist with teaching and learning of the future.
 “Banning these would also be pointless due to them being widely available and their seamless integration into word processing programmes,” he said, adding that plagiarism detection tools such as Turnitin or CopyLeaks are helping to keep AI tools in check.",jaya plagiarism detection platform turnitin artificial intelligence detec tion feature finding paper march paper turnitin statement detection feature report turnitin workflow educator percentage document writing tool lar chatgpt gene turnitin consistent presence data continued view writing tool education complex puzzle educator institution factor piece detection discussion student table classroom academic policy essay prompt chief product officer annie chechitelli juncture education technology academic integrity stake education loo resource enable perform technology detection feature advance academic integrity statement turnitin study student generative tool monthly weekly daily survey technology faculty institution generative usage growth revelation tertiary institution student ethical technology crucial usage education bad curriculum prepare student future technology job vice chancellor private university chairman mushtak atabi paradox education potential simplify complicate academic assessment advancement tool simplicity assignment student compels institution human centric assessment method future student idea panel expert deeper engagement study rote learning expert industry enhan link academia real life employability prospect student prof mushtak heriot watt university malaysia provost ceo plagiarism sign laziness symptom student educational journey prioritise grade rele vance study real apparent antidote cultivate deep sense purpose student skill impact mushtak play transformative role educator portion academic time administrative duty task student routine task free educator student sunway education chief executive officer prof datuk lee seve ral measure academic staff generative learning time detect irresponsible guideline staff student expectation boundary limitation gene rative tool formative summative assessment writing tool launched student understand limitation boundary unfair prof student future generative tool job integrated promote responsible ethical complement enhance human ability continuous evolution encou academician rethink assessment relevant outcome avoid tool ability challenge usage enhance gap education provision student taught skill future job market curriculum prepare student malaysian association pri vate college university president datuk parmjit singh writing tool positive evolution technology education correct ethical utilisation tool scientific calculator positive impact coexist learning future pointless seamless integration word processing programme plagiarism detection tool copyleaks tool check,"[(10, 0.9969483)]",10
673312,Main,15,22/04/2024,AI still cannot surpass human intelligence,,"TECHNOLOGY, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), in the 21st century has reached a point where, many fear, it could eventually replace humans, leading to high unemployment rates, among others. 
 While AI undoubtedly offers new levels of efficiency and innovation to many businesses, human intelligence still possesses a fundamental quality that cannot be replicated. 
 Machines, including AI, are still unable to replicate creativity, the essence of human intelligence. In contrast to algorithms that function according to predetermined parameters, humans have the ability to envision a universe that extends beyond current boundaries, to think creatively, and to generate original ideas. 
 The human mind thrives on innovation and the capacity to envision possibilities that defy conventional wisdom, whether in the form of revolutionary scientific theories, works of literature or other creative endeavours. 
 Artificial intelligence may mimic patterns and produce results based on available data, but it is unable to imitate the spark of inspiration that propels human genius.
 Furthermore, human interaction is infused with emotion, a complex aspect in which comprehension, empathy, and intuition play crucial roles. 
 Proficiency in truly human-centred empathy and connection is essential in fields such as counselling, therapy and caregiving. At this point, AI is unable to fully understand the complexities of human emotions, motives and experiences despite its ability to analyse data and propose answers based on algorithms. 
 Moreover, artificial intelligence will never be able to fully grasp the intricate and subtle art of human connection.
 Other characteristics of human intelligence are resilience and adaptability, which enable people to confront adversity head-on with courage and grace. The capacity to learn, unlearn and relearn is essential in a world that is changing rapidly and where change is the only constant. 
 Humans are cognitively flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions, think quickly and overcome obstacles with sheer determination and resourcefulness. 
 AI excels in jobs with clear specifications, but it is less effective in unstructured settings with significant ambiguity and uncertainty. 
 Let us remember that AI is not a replacement for the special traits that make us fundamentally human, including the ability to dream, empathise and to flourish in the face of difficulty as we embrace its revolutionary promises. 
 Human intelligence will always be in demand in many industries while AI serves as a tool that can help us achieve our goals. DR FAIZ MASNAN

673070,Lifestyle,21,21/04/2024,AI influencers       shake up  social media,"AI-generated influencers are gaining traction on social media, presenting both opportunities and challenges in the evolving realm of digital marketing.","SOCIAL media influencers have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) to spice up their content, but they are also facing growing competition from AI-generated Instagramers, TikTokers and YouTubers.
 Sporting pink hair and posing in lingerie, swimsuits or gym outfits, Aitana Lopez has more than 300,000 followers on Instagram, where she is described as a “gamer at heart” and “fitness lover” – except she’s not real.Aitana was created by The Clueless, a Barcelona-based company that describes itself as an “AI modelling agency” run by “visionaries on a mission to redefine the world of influencers”.
 Sofia Novales, project manager at The Clueless, said the “rising costs associated with human influencers” were a reason behind the company’s creation.
 “Virtual models, being digital, present a more economical alternative,” Novales said.
 Another plus: total control over content.
 “The advantages lie in unparalleled creative control, allowing seamless decision-making on image, fashion, and aesthetics without the need for physical photoshoots,” Novales said.
 The rise of AI has fuelled concerns about the proliferation of deepfake videos that could be used maliciously.
 Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, said it would start putting “Made with AI labels” on AI-generated content in May.
 AI presents a huge business opportunity for content creators: The influencer market is expected to grow rapidly, from US$16.5bil (RM78.44bil) in 2022 to nearly US$200bil (RM950.8bil) by 2032, according to Allied Market Research.Younger audience
 Using virtual influencers is not new: Barbie already has millions of followers on Instagram.
 But they are now being used in advertisements where they can’t be told apart from a real person.
 Take Lil Miquela, a “19-year-old robot living in LA” created by a California agency in 2016.
 With 2.6 million followers on Instagram and 3.5 million on TikTok, Lil Maqueta has promoted brands as big as BMW.The idea was to “create something never seen before”, the German premium carmaker said in a statement.
 “Attracting a younger,  technology-savvy generation is for us the icing on the cake,” it said.
 Maud Lejeune, who heads up the Paris-based digital strategy agency AD Crew, said that it isn’t difficult for the public to accept AI influencers.
 “It’s like actors on TV: we know it isn’t real, yet we follow them and we find it interesting, it’s like watching a mini-series.”
 AD Crew represents more than 30 influencers, but Lejeune created her own virtual influencer, Metagaya, two years ago.
 “The current level of design didn’t exist then. It’s technical, you’ve got to dress them, take photos for the background, create a story,” said Lejeune, acknowledging that Metagaya didn’t turn out very well.
 The rapid technological progress brought by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora video generator could make it easier to create and operate realistic virtual influencers.
 Aided by AI
 Human influencers are also seizing on AI technology to make better videos.
 France’s Charles Sterlings sees an opportunity to improve translations.
 He uses different tools on platforms like HeyGen and Rask.ai to automatically translate and lip-sync his video posts into English and Spanish.
 Sterlings also uses Deepshot, a platform that allows users to create deepfakes by changing the words and mouth movements of people in real videos.
 He said it took him just a few minutes and a few dollars to manipulate a video of French President Emmanuel Macron.
 But Sterlings sees the technology as a competitor as well as a useful tool.
 “Anyone with a phone can be an influencer. But eventually, it will be artificial intelligence, available 24 hours a day, and much cheaper to develop,” he said.
 For Maud Lejeune, AI can help influencers produce more content.

671894,StarBiz,13,18/04/2024,Ernie Bot helps Chinese tech giant Baidu double down on AI push,,"SHENZHEN: Chinese tech heavyweight Baidu Inc says its large language model and ChatGPT-like chatbot, Ernie Bot, has garnered more than 200 million users since its debut in March 2023.
 The company said it is ramping up efforts to bolster the commercial application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology.
 On Tuesday, Baidu showcased a suite of AI models and development toolkits to empower individuals with accessible and easy-to-use tools to create AI applications at the Create 2024 Baidu AI Developer Conference in Shenzhen, Guangdong.
 Robin Li, co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Baidu, said at the event that the Ernie LLM has now emerged as China’s leading AI foundation model with the broadest range of applications.
 LLMs refer to AI models fed with huge amounts of text data for use in a variety of tasks, ranging from natural language processing to machine translation.
 Li said the Ernie model has achieved an obvious upgrade with improved performance in code generation, code interpretation, and code optimisation in recent months, and its capabilities have reached a world-leading level.
 The inference performance of the Ernie model has improved by 105 times compared with the one launched last March, and its inference cost has been reduced to only 1% of the previous version, he said.
 Furthermore, more than 85,000 enterprise clients have used Baidu’s enterprise-level LLM platform, Qianfan, to create 190,000 AI applications.
 “AI is catalysing a revolution in creativity. In the future, developing an AI application will be as straightforward as creating a short video. Everyone can be a developer and create,” Li said.
 Li also said multimodal LLMs that integrate different types of content like text, images, speech and video into AI models are key to the future development of AI.
 This approach has been largely regarded as essential for realising artificial general intelligence, which is a theoretical AI system with capabilities that rival those of a human, Li said.
 Charlie Dai, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester, a research firm, said that as one of the leaders in the AI software market in China, Baidu has made substantial progress in the technological evolution of foundation models, which are becoming critical for next-generation AI applications.
 He added that the company was expanding its business ecosystem of generative AI technology.
 At the event, Li also noted that “the most significant use for large visual models is in autonomous driving systems”.
 Baidu’s goal is not just about teaching AI to create video but also about enabling AI to comprehend real-world dynamics and predict future events, which are critical for driving autonomously.
 He said the company has utilised extensive data from over 100 million kilometres of testing on complex city roads in China to develop the visual model for its autonomous driving platform, Apollo.
 The multimodal LLM is an undeniable future development direction for generative AI technology, said Lu Yanxia, research director at market consultancy IDC China.
 She added that the LLMs necessitate a higher demand for data and knowledge in professional fields and for talent that can fine-tune specialised models based on diverse industrial demands.
 Lu said Chinese tech companies should pool more resources into improving computing power, algorithms and the quality of data to gain a competitive edge in the global AI chatbot race.
 Pan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for Information and Communication Economy, which operates under the aegis of the Industry and Information Technology Ministry, said the Ernie model made achievements in some specialised application scenarios like AI programming.
 Pan said more efforts should be made to bolster the vertical industrial application of LLMs in a wider range of sectors. — China Daily/ANN",shenzhen chinese tech baidu language model chatgpt chatbot ernie bot user march company effort commercial application generative artificial intelligence technology tuesday baidu suite model development toolkits individual accessible easy tool application baidu developer conference shenzhen guangdong robin founder chairman chief executive officer baidu event ernie llm china foundation model broadest range application model huge amount text data variety task natural language processing machine translation ernie model obvious upgrade performance code generation code interpretation code optimisation month capability level inference performance ernie model time march inference cost previous version enterprise client enterprise level llm platform qianfan create application revolution creativity future application straightforward short video developer create multimodal llm integrate type content text image video model key future development approach essential artificial intelligence theoretical system capability human charlie dai vice president principal analyst forrester firm leader software market china substantial progress technological evolution foundation model critical generation application company business ecosystem generative technology event visual model autonomous system baidu goal create video comprehend real dynamic future event critical company utilised extensive data kilometre complex city road visual model autonomous platform apollo multimodal llm undeniable future development direction generative technology yanxia director market consultancy idc china llm necessitate demand data professional field talent fine tune model diverse industrial demand chinese tech company resource power algorithm quality data competitive edge global chatbot race pan expert committee communication economy aegis industry technology ministry model achievement application scenario pan effort vertical industrial application llm range sector daily ann,"[(13, 0.9959584)]",13
671712,Main,3,17/04/2024,AI security systems can help identify potential threats,,"PETALING JAYA: Improving airport security through a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), enhanced security measures and staff training is key to preventing future untoward incidents at airports, say experts.
 This comes after a shooting incident at the Kuala Lumpur  International Airport (KLIA).
 Criminologist Datuk Dr P. Sundramoorthy suggested implementing AI into scanning devices to allow for better identification of potential threats before they even enter the airport.
 “AI can help scanners distinguish potential threats, such as guns and knives, as machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognise specific patterns and signatures of dangerous objects, reducing the reliance on manual screening.”
 Sundramoorthy, who is with Universiti Sains Malaysia’s Centre for Policy Research, added that combining AI with enhanced scanning devices, like advanced X-ray machines and explosive detection systems, would help security personnel better identify hidden threats.
 “Having scanners and officers at all airport entry points would be a feasible option but requires significant financial investments and increased manpower.
 “While it can significantly enhance security, it also needs to be balanced with cost-effectiveness and passenger convenience,” he added.
 Crime analyst Kamal Affandi Hashim said incorporating AI into enhanced CCTV systems to detect suspicious behaviour would be key to preventing untoward incidents.
 “AI can be trained to detect suspicious behaviour in the crowd, that will then be automatically flagged to allow for quick predictive policing,” he said.
 He added that increasing the presence of security personnel along with the use of weapon-­detecting trained dogs on patrols at airports would be a good supportive measure.
 Criminologist Dr Zalmizy Hussin had a similar idea, adding that AI-enhanced CCTV systems could be integrated with existing scanner and access control systems to be more comprehensive.
 “By analysing real-time video feeds and combining them with scanner data, AI can provide a more holistic approach to threat detection and prevention by basically automating most of the threat detection process.
 “These integrated security systems, that connect various security technologies and databases, will allow for real-time monitoring, data analysis and coordinated response to security incidents.
 “In addition to increasing airport security efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, it also improves the overall passenger experience by reducing waiting times and increasing operational efficiency,” the senior lecturer at Universiti Utara Malaysia said.
  Dr Zalmizy added that providing in-depth behavioural analysis training for police officers would also be key to supporting such AI security systems.
 “These personnel should receive regular training on threat assessment, behavioural analysis, and response protocols to enhance their ability to identify and respond to security threats.
 “Combined with public awareness campaigns on airport security measures and the importance of reporting suspicious behaviour, educate passengers on security protocols and encourage their active participation to serve as an additional layer of defence for airport security,” he said.",jaya airport security combination artificial intelligence security measure staff training key future untoward incident airport expert incident kuala international airport klia datuk sundramoorthy device potential threat airport scanner distinguish potential threat knife machine algorithm recognise specific dangerous object reliance manual screening sundramoorthy universiti sains malaysia centre policy device advanced ray machine explosive detection system security personnel hidden threat scanner officer entry feasible option financial investment manpower enhance security cost effectiveness passenger convenience crime analyst kamal affandi hashim cctv system suspicious behaviour key untoward incident suspicious behaviour crowd quick predictive presence security personnel trained dog patrol airport supportive measure criminologist zalmizy hussin idea cctv system scanner access control system real time video feed scanner data holistic approach threat detection prevention threat detection process integrated security system security technology real time data analysis response security incident addition airport security efficiency accuracy cost effectiveness passenger experience time operational efficiency senior lecturer universiti utara malaysia zalmizy depth behavioural analysis training police officer security system personnel regular training threat assessment behavioural analysis response enhance ability respond security threat public awareness campaign security measure suspicious behaviour educate passenger security encourage active participation additional layer defence airport security,"[(4, 0.99503314)]",4
671440,StarBiz,8,16/04/2024,SNS poised to benefit from  AI and growth  of data centres,,"PETALING JAYA: SNS Network Technology Bhd’s robust financial performance is expected to be supported by new artificial intelligence (AI) server sales and continued growth in its existing information communication technology (ICT) business. 
 According to Rakuten Trade Research, growth in the group’s ICT business will be backed by consumer-device refresh cycles and ongoing digital transformation in education and commerce. 
 The research house also noted that SNS serves as a crucial link between server manufacturers and buyers, facilitating AI adoption and integration.
 “Recognising the potential of AI across various sectors in Malaysia, SNS positions itself as a facilitator of AI adoption. 
 “Acting as a liaison between server manufacturers and buyers, SNS plays a pivotal role in enabling AI integration in Malaysia,” the research firm said in a report. 
 Moreover, SNS excels in other segments such as data centre fit-out, testing, commissioning and operations management, though it is not directly involved in construction. 
 “By offering a comprehensive suite of services, including cloud computing, data analytics and AI workload optimisation, SNS addresses diverse business needs. 
 “Its recent partnership with Supermicro aligns well with Supermicro’s expansion plans in Johor, further solidifying SNS’  position in the market,” Rakuten Trade Research said.

670896,Lifestyle,5,15/04/2024,"Robots, drones and AI enter the arena",The fusion of sports and technology is crafting the playing fields of the future.,"THE lines between sports and technology are increasingly blurring, with recent developments bringing the two fields closer than ever before. 
 While esports and sports video games have long been a point of intersection, it’s the latest technological advancements that are having an impact on traditional sports and even leading to the creation of new ones.
 This fusion stems from people who ask unconventional questions, such as what would happen if a team of robots could play football? 
 Their curiosity has led to explorations beyond the ordinary, challenging the limits of what’s possible in sports and technology alike.Robot rivalries
 While artificial intelligence is currently at the forefront of tech trends, it may come as a surprise to many that the journey of teaching AI-powered robots to play football began as early as 1996.The RoboCup (short for the Robot World Cup Initiative) is an annual event that features autonomous robot teams facing off in football matches, operating completely independently without human intervention.
 Participants in the RoboCup span several leagues: in the middle size league, teams field five custom-designed robots, while the small size league mirrors a full football squad with 11 robotic players on each team.
 Additionally, RoboCup includes a standard platform league and a humanoid league, which is further segmented into kid-size and adult-size robot categories.
 Each team designs and builds all robots for the RoboCup in accordance with the competition’s specifications. However, the standard platform league uses a predesigned robot to determine which team has the smartest software.
 In addition to showcasing football-playing robots, the upcoming edition of RoboCup in July will also feature competitions for autonomous rescue robots, industrial robotics, and robots designed to assist with household tasks.The autonomous rescue robots will compete in emergency response scenarios that are too hazardous for humans. The finals will include a search and identification mission involving simulated victims.
 Household assistant robots will compete in one of three categories: general household tasks, social interactions, or an open category where researchers have more freedom to decide on their submission.
 For those in search of more adrenaline-fueled excitement, there is Drone Soccer, which first kicked off in South Korea. True to its name, Drone Soccer involves teams of drones controlled by humans – five players per team – engaging in a game of aerial football, unlike the autonomous robots of RoboCup.
 Premiered at CES 2024, Drone Soccer, inspired by the magical game of Quidditch from the Harry Potter universe, showcased drones ramming into each other as they tried to stop opponents from scoring goals in intense three-minute matches.
 Each team is divided into three defenders guarding their goal, one striker – the only drone designated to score – and a forward who jumps into the striker’s role in case of damage or a crash.
 Points are earned by skilfully guiding the striker drone through the goal hoop, a task that requires careful navigation – especially when considering these drones can fly at speeds of up to 80kph and the 60cm hoop is positioned 3.5m above the ground.
 The inaugural professional league for Drone Soccer was established just last year, setting the stage for the sport’s first World Cup event, which is scheduled to take place in South Korea in October 2025.
 Electrifying excitement
 A motorsport grounded in technology is Formula E, which is akin to Formula One but exclusively features electric vehicles (EVs). 
 Operating under the same governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it is sanctioned as an FIA World Championship alongside Formula One.The FIA touts Formula E as the first certified carbon-neutral sport, and automakers use it as a proving ground for innovative EV technologies.
 For example, Nissan’s website attributes the improved power management in its consumer vehicles to advances made in battery efficiency within Formula E.
 Similarly, Maserati leveraged data from Formula E to refine the software in its connected electric vehicles. 
 Formula E races occur on street circuits around the globe, in cities such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, Berlin, Jakarta, and previously in Putrajaya during 2015.In early March, it was reported that Malaysia received an offer to host the 2025 Formula E-Prix Grand Finale in Kuala Lumpur as an annual event that will continue until 2030.
 The local partner involved said they are anticipating a decision from the Prime Minister’s Office.

671094,StarBiz,10,15/04/2024,"Race for AI  isn’t zero-sum,  says Amazon cloud boss",,"San Francisco: As Google races with Microsoft and OpenAI to create world-changing generative artificial intelligence (AI), some critics see Amazon as lagging behind.
 “I respectfully disagree” with that viewpoint, said Adam Selipsky, Amazon’s cloud chief, in an interview with AFP.
 Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta have made headlines talking about their own foundational models, or those of their close partners, that are key to AI and its ability to produce written works, images, videos or even computer code from simple user prompts.
 But “there is simply not going to be one model to rule them all,” argued Selipsky.
 AWS, Amazon’s industry-leading cloud branch, is already seeing customers “needing multiple models for multiple different use cases”, he explained.
 He cited the capabilities of various AI models available on the AWS Bedrock platform, such as Meta’s Llama and Claude from Anthropic, as well as some from Mistral in France and Amazon’s own Titan brand.
 Generative AI is regarded in Silicon Valley as poised to revolutionise the way people get jobs done.
 And cloud computing companies, which have massive computing power, troves of data and AI expertise, now host generative AI models. They are in a prime position to capitalise on the new technology – but they have a lot to lose if they don’t cough up the latest innovations.
 A pioneer of eCommerce, Amazon also dominates the cloud. AWS had 31% of the cloud computing market at the end of 2023, according to Stocklytics.
 But rivals Microsoft and Google are gaining ground with their cloud businesses, with 24% and 11% market share, respectively.
 Thanks to a US$13bil investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Microsoft is “in the driver’s seat” of an ongoing cloud revolution, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
 Microsoft and Google compete with their in-house, AI-infused digital assistants to help with creating content – emails, presentations, ads – and applications (especially chatbots).
 AWS is less known to the public and its digital assistant Alexa is not yet as conversational as ChatGPT.
 But Amazon has been in the AI business for more than 25 years, said Selipsky. “If you go back to personalisation on the retail website in 1998 – we called it personalisation, but it was AI.”
 The Seattle firm has long had thousands of people working on the technology and has pivoted some of them to the new frontier of generative AI, Selipsky said.
 “We’ve moved rapidly on new generations of our (AI) chips like Trainium, and building Amazon Bedrock, and getting it adopted quickly and coming out with exciting applications on top of the models, like Amazon Q”, an AI assistant, he said.
 Selipsky, who took command of AWS in 2021, replacing Andy Jassy, who stepped into the chief executive role vacated by founder Jeff Bezos, was confident Amazon would remain a leader in cloud computing.
 As proof, he points to AWS customers and partners, including Nvidia.
 The high-profile chipmaker recently announced it is building a “supercomputer” on AWS using Nvidia’s own high-performing processors, the ultrasophisticated and coveted GPUs.
 Most notably, Amazon has invested US$4bil in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival that is also backed by Google. The start-up will use AWS and its Trainium chips to build AI models and help “improve our technology”, said Selipsky. — AFP",san francisco google race openai create generative artificial intelligence critic disagree viewpoint adam selipsky amazon cloud chief interview afp tech giant microsoft google meta headline foundational model close partner key ability image computer code simple user prompt rule selipsky aws industry cloud branch customer multiple model multiple capability model bedrock platform meta llama claude anthropic mistral france amazon titan brand generative silicon valley revolutionise people job company power trove data expertise host generative model prime position capitalise technology lot lose cough innovation ecommerce amazon cloud aws market stocklytics rival google gaining ground cloud business market share bil investment chatgpt maker microsoft seat cloud revolution wedbush analyst dan microsoft google house digital assistant content email presentation ad application chatbots public digital assistant conversational chatgpt amazon business selipsky personalisation retail website personalisation seattle firm thousand people technology generative selipsky generation chip trainium building amazon bedrock exciting application top model assistant selipsky command andy jassy chief executive role founder jeff bezos confident amazon remain leader cloud proof aws customer partner nvidia profile chipmaker building supercomputer nvidia processor coveted gpus bil anthropic openai rival google start trainium chip model technology selipsky afp,"[(2, 0.71294075), (9, 0.28207594)]",2
670754,Main,6,14/04/2024,Wong to share views on AI and media at int’l forum,‘Healthier food choices and eating earlier promote longevity’,"KUALA LUMPUR: Media personality Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai has been invited by China Media Group (CMG), one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world, to participate in an international forum on artificial intelligence and the media.
 The Bernama chairman and Star Media Group adviser will share his views on how the media can balance the effectiveness of AI as a platform and use it responsibly.
 “We need to embrace AI as it will bring a lot of benefits to our job as media practitioners. We can focus on the more important tasks and use AI as a tool to alle­viate tedious tasks.
 “For example, AI tools can help streamline time-consuming processes and laborious tasks. This will allow us to focus on revenue,  content and creativity,’’ he said.
 The three-day forum “Force of Good: A Shared Responsibility’’ will bring global journalists, aca­demicians and experts from relevant fields to exchange ideas and views in Beijing from April 28.
 CMG operates a vast broadcas­ting network, comprising 51 television channels including nine  international channels and 22 radio frequencies targeting domes­tic audiences as well as programming in 80 languages for its global audience.
 The group’s major outlets are China Central Television (CCTV), China Radio International (CRI) and China Global Television Network which offers English, French, Arabic and Russian TV channels.
 Wong regarded himself as a content creator but not an AI specialist, so he hoped to learn and upskill himself in this area from his peers and experts in AI.
 The veteran journalist, how­ever, said that he would be presenting a video where AI would be used to enable him to speak in Chinese to the audience.
 “Unlike the past, where voices are dubbed and the speaker looks artificial and awkward, AI is able to help me look proficient, professional and articulate in the video even though I cannot speak much Mandarin,’’ he said.
 The same video, he said, can be used, via AI, for any other languages which would help reach a wider global audience.
 The video, he said, was created by Bernama, the Malaysian natio­nal news agency, and Huawei Malaysia, a leading global provi­der of information and communications technology.
 Wong said he would also be talking on the importance of embracing AI and the forum in several scheduled TV interviews by CCTV in English and Bahasa Malaysia.
 Wong is also a member of the Asia Pacific Committee of the World Association of News Publishers (Wan-Ifra).

 When the fifth and final instalment of the Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny, was released in 2023, it sparked a humorous exchange between generations. 
 A millennial expressed interest in seeing the latest instalment but was met by a father’s bemused response: “Which Indiana Jones movie are you going to watch?”, emphasising the film franchise’s long history.
 This bewilderment was warranted. In the opening scenes of the 2023 movie, audiences meet a noticeably younger version of main actor Harrison Ford, reminiscent of his appearance in the 1980s films.
 This deageing effect was made possible by visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). 
 The creators claimed they didn’t rely solely on AI or machine learning but instead used a comprehensive VFX tool called “ILM FaceSwap” alongside the expertise of more than 100 visual effects artists -- yet questions remain about the growing use of AI in filmmaking.
 It’s possible that the latest advances in AI technology could mean those visual effects artists may be made redundant in the not-too distant future. 
 ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unveiled the first short films created using its new video AI tool Sora, with filmmakers describing the creations as “totally  surreal”.
 Early clips generated using the AI software show how it could take a simple written prompt and turn it into a realistic video of the scenario.
 AI technology is remarkable. But there are concerns about its benefits and ethical implications, and how it can sometimes raise eyebrows. 
 AI is both a collaborator pushing the boundaries of artistic expression as well as seen as a potential threat to artists sometimes. The use of AI in film and television has been a contentious topic since last year’s Hollywood strikes, where writers and actors expressed anxiety about their future in the industry.
 AI has the potential to revolutionise filmmaking by creating scripts and generating visuals. However, challenges include audience acceptance, legal uncertainties surrounding copyright, and the ethical implications of AI dominance in creative industries will still plague its use. We might even see deceased movie legends gracing the silver screens soon enough.
 Despite advancements, AI has its limitations. Unlike AI, artists can draw on real-life experiences and challenge people to see complexities, identifying and confronting biases within the arts and other media forms.
 The ethical and philosophical challenges of AI extend beyond aesthetics. The recent controversy surrounding the British royal family’s poorly edited photo and questions about the authenticity of Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton’s cancer announcement video highlights these  concerns.
 The creation of sexualised deepfakes without consent, often targeting women and leaving them with lasting trauma, poses significant ethical and legal challenges, prompting a re-evaluation of existing laws and responses.
 AI’s influence across these creative industries necessitates ongoing discussions to ensure responsible development and a future where human creativity and technological innovation can work cohesively. – 360info

670662,Main,31,14/04/2024,Meta turns to AI to protect minors,Social media giant says it is testing ‘nudity protection tool’ to blur explicit images,"Paris: Meta said it is developing new tools to protect teenage users from “sextortion” scams on its Instagram platform, which has been accused by politicians in the United States of damaging the mental health of youngsters.Gangs run sextortion scams by persuading people to provide explicit images of themselves and then threatening to release them to the public unless they receive money.Meta said it is testing a “nudity protection” tool that would find and blur images containing nudity that were sent to minors on the app’s messaging system.
 “This way, the recipient is not exposed to unwanted intimate content and has the choice to see the image or not,” Capucine Tuf-fier, who is in charge of child protection at Meta France, said on Thursday.
 The US company said it would also offer advice and safety tips to anyone sending or receiving such messages.
 Some 3,000 young people fell victim to sexploitation scams in 2022 in the US, according to the authorities there.Separately, more than 40 US states began suing Meta in October in a case that accuses the company of having “profited from children’s pain”.The legal filing alleged Meta had exploited young users by creating a business model designed to maximise time they spend on the platform despite harm to their health.
 Meta announced in January it would roll out measures to protect under-18s that included tightening content restrictions and boosting parental supervision tools.
 The firm said on Thursday that the latest tools were building on “our long-standing work to help protect young people from unwanted or potentially harmful contact”.
 “We’re testing new features to help protect young people from sextortion and intimate image abuse and to make it more difficult for potential scammers and criminals to find and interact with teens,” the company said.
 It added that the “nudity protection” tool used “on-device machine learning”, a kind of artificial intelligence, to analyse images.The firm, which is also constantly accused of violating the data privacy of its users, stressed that it would not have access to the images unless users reported them.
 Meta said it would also use AI tools to identify accounts sending offending material and severely restrict their ability to interact with young users on the platform.

670802,StarEdu,3,14/04/2024,"Adding value with AI, digital tech",,"A SIGNIFICANT shift is underway in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with a strong focus on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in finance roles, highlighting the necessity for professionals to adapt and embrace new skills.
 According to the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) latest annual Global Talent Trends Survey 2024, 78% of respondents believe AI will enable finance professionals to add more value to what they do, while 54% believe they are not developing the skills needed for the future workplace.
 “Across APAC, we’re witnessing a transformative phase where AI and digital technologies are not just tools but essential elements that redefine the value finance professionals bring to the table.
 “It’s a compelling and exciting call to action for organisations, individuals and future professional talent to leverage these technologies, enhancing analytical capabilities and strategic insights,” said ACCA (Asia Pacific) director Pulkit Abrol.
 This wake-up call comes in the biggest global talent survey across the accountancy profession, providing a view of howpeople feel about their life at work.
 Almost 10,000 professional accountants from 157 countries including Malaysia were asked about the concerns they held around future work and aspirations for their careers. 
 A spotlight was also cast on the in-demand soft skills that are pivotal in the current climate. Communication, problem-solving, adaptability, and initiative were identified as the core competencies employers in APAC eagerly seek. These skills complement the technical expertise in finance, enabling professionals to navigate the complexities of the modern business environment effectively.The annual survey of finance professionals also emphasised the importance of continuous learning and development, encouraging professionals in APAC to engage in lifelong education to remain competitive.
 “The landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, and staying ahead means being proactive about learning and personal development. 
 “ACCA is committed to supporting our community of members and future members through this journey, providing resources and platforms to enhance their skills and confidently embrace the future,” said Abrol.
 The survey, which also assessed key workplace issues such as hybrid working, diversity, mobility and mental health and the cost-of-living crisis, revealed that 73% pointed to a strong diversity and inclusion culture as a key factor in deciding to work at an organisation, as the talent crunch continues with over half expecting to move on in their career. 
 While hybrid working, a mix of office- and home-based working, is slowly gaining traction, big mismatches remain between what employees want and what employers demand. 
 A whopping 76% of all employees surveyed said it’s their preferred arrangement but in Malaysia, only 43% are in hybrid working arrangements while 54% are in the office full time.
 Within the APAC market, a staggering 58% of professionals are seeking a pay rise this year, reflecting the growing concern over compensation amid global economic strains. However, half of those surveyed believe that transitioning to a new organisation is necessary to achieve their financial goals.
 “This underscores the urgent need for organisations in APAC to rethink their talent retention strategies, ensuring that career progression and financial recognition are aligned with the expectations of their workforce,” said Abrol.",shift asia pacific apac region strong focus artificial intelligence finance role necessity professional embrace skill association certified accountant annual global talent trend survey respondent enable finance professional skill future workplace apac transformative phase digital technology essential element finance professional table compelling call action organisation individual future professional talent leverage technology analytical capability strategic insight acca asia pacific director pulkit abrol call biggest global talent survey accountancy profession view howpeople life professional accountant country malaysia concern future aspiration career cast demand soft skill pivotal current climate communication adaptability initiative core competency employer seek skill complement technical expertise finance professional navigate complexity business environment annual survey finance professional continuous development professional apac engage lifelong education competitive landscape unprecedented pace proactive personal development acca community future journey resource platform skill future abrol survey key workplace issue hybrid diversity mobility mental health cost living crisis strong diversity inclusion culture key factor organisation talent crunch half career hybrid mix office traction mismatch employee employer employee preferred arrangement malaysia hybrid arrangement office time market staggering professional pay rise concern compensation global economic strain organisation financial goal urgent organisation talent retention strategy career progression financial recognition expectation abrol,"[(6, 0.9950341)]",6
670514,StarExtra,4,13/04/2024,Injecting AI into dialogue dynamics,Tech demos show the potential of AI-powered characters and conversational gameplay in which players try to talk their way to their goals.,"GLIMPSES of the future often emerge at the Game Developers Conference. It’s where indie games generate a buzz or the kernel of a big idea is planted.
 This year, artificial intelligence (AI) took centre stage as Nvidia showed off the jaw-dropping capabilities of its chipsets and software companies such as Convai and Ubisoft revealed intriguing gameplay opportunities.
 AI has been the source of hype and fear over the past year. It’s been at the centre of labour conflict in Hollywood, while in the tech industry, companies see it as a way to improve efficiency.
 In the primordial tech ooze of video games, AI is set up to have a transformative impact on one part of the industry.
 Enter Convai
 Convai, a company that creates AI developer tools, offered a firsthand look at three projects. One was Second Life, where representatives showed how AI bots could act as guides for novice players.
 In a massively multiplayer online game, the non-playable characters act almost like concierges with more agency.
 Players can ask them about locations, and they can teleport them to new locales. They can generate surfboards on command, so they can hang ten on a virtual beach. What’s notable is that the AI can not only answer questions but also know the environment around it.
 The bot even has long-term memory so that it can recall places that players visited.
 This raises privacy issues, but Convai said each bot has its own speaker profile, and there’s no mixing of memories. Developers can also limit the memory by time so that it will forget.
 Stormgate is an upcoming real-time strategy game from Frost Giant Studio, and in that demo, a character named Dr Fletcher offered me a sitrep about what’s happening on the battlefield.
 This demo wouldn’t be in the game, but I could ask the NPC about the world, and she would offer hints into the lore.
 Project Neural Nexus 
 By far the most impressive demo was Project Neural Nexus. It takes place in a cyberpunk world and throws players into a situation where a woman named Seraph has to guide players to the roof.
 That would be a normal scene in a video game that transitions to a bigger fight, but while wandering through the world, Convai officials urged me to talk with the inhabitants.
 I chatted with them as I walked to the objective, learning more about the world, but I wanted to have a little more fun with it, so I asked one character if I could borrow some money, and they responded without a hiccup, berating me.
 Later in the demo, Seraph handed me a gun, and I asked what kind of weapon it was (it’s hard to tell with futuristic sci-fi weapons) and she told me it was a submachine gun. It showed the characters also knew about objects in the world as well as the general setting.
 Curious about her long hair, I asked where she got it cut, and she told me she didn’t have time to have her hair done while fighting the enemy.
 The most interesting conversation I had was with Mae “Shadow” Liang. This masked character was bragging about how she wasn’t bound by any law and that, as an assassin, she could do whatever she wanted. 
 I brought up the Geneva Conventions and asked if they applied to her trade, thinking she wouldn’t know anything about them. To my surprise, she responded and gave a shockingly interesting answer.
 The other fascinating interaction involved a robot named Wendy. I spoke with it, and the robot was aggressively hostile toward me. Taking offence, I criticised it and the robot shot back at me for one more memorable conversation.
 It was strange how an NPC could elicit such a strong reaction from a simple conversation. It just deepened the believability.
 Nvidia’s demo
 I had a similar experience at the Nvidia demo called Covert Protocol, which featured Inworld AI technology. In this situation, I had to gain access to the room of NexaLife’s chief technology officer (CTO). I went in knowing nothing, and I had to talk my way to gaining information.
 I started with the doorman, Tae, who I learned was also an aspiring comedian. I asked him to tell a joke, and it was a bit tepid, but he did guide me to the reception, Sophia.
 With Sophia, I straight up tried to ask her for the CTO’s room number, but she rejected me, citing Wavre Hotels’ policy that protected clients’ privacy.
 I asked her where I could get a drink, and she directed me to the bar right across from her. Again, these AI-driven NPCs are aware of the items in the room as well as what’s around them.
 I ran into Diego Martinez, who was also a Nexalife executive, but he was under strain having to write a keynote speech. I asked him about his colleague’s room number, but he wasn’t having any of it. He came off as standoffish, so I lied to him and told him I was the police and needed that information.
 Interestingly, he didn’t budge and was even more sarcastic and gruff. The demo ended in failure, but it had a different feel from the Convai one. It felt more focused, and I had to peel away at the right responses.I couldn’t go back and talk to him again because, like in the Convai demo, Diego would remember me and what I said.
 In developers’ hands
 Lastly, I experienced what AI technology could do in the hands of a video game company. Ubisoft offered a demo featuring their Neo NPCs. It takes place in another future dystopic world, and players meet with a member of the resistance named Bloom.
 Virginie Mosser, the Ubisoft narrative director, called the experience conversational gameplay. Unlike the previous demos, this one was more guided, as players had objectives they had to accomplish to build trust with the Neo NPC.
 Players have to look for openings in the back and forth and use those to find out more about the world and Bloom, my fellow resistance fighter.
 When I asked him why he wanted to fight the megacorporations, he mentioned that he had a son, so I asked about his name. He said the child was named Evrand. That effort increased the trust level between us, and at the same time, a robot beside us commented on my interviewing prowess.
 The chat between me and the NPC showed how players will have to figure out ways to artfully bring up subjects and investigate the character in front of them.
 I learned that Bloom was non-violent and a generally positive person. If I went beyond the boundaries and asked a random question, the AI would steer the conversation to be on mission in a subtle way.
 During one of the more surreal answers, Mosser said the Neo NPC was hallucinating. Sometimes, when a question pierces the knowledge base, they come up with vague answers that sometimes sound normal.
 Planning a heist
 The other part of the demo introduced me to Iron. She’s a female leader of the resistance and asks for my opinion on a mission to break into a villa and steal some files. Around the front yard, there were several possibilities.
 A tree nearby could allow access to a window, and a grappling hook was one of the tools. I brought up the tree first, but she had hesitations about it because she didn’t know if a branch would hold up both of us. She took to the grappling hook idea.
 Looking over other tools available, I saw a note where Bloom was supposed to praise or mention what he thought of you based on your prior talk, according to Mosser.
 It’s another generative twist in the gameplay that shows how players impact the characters.
 The next section dealt with the guard, and the first thing I asked was if we knew anything about him.
 She said he had prior military experience, so I knew maybe a tranquilliser dart may not be a good idea. I suggested sleeping gas, and she liked that idea.
 The last section was the surveillance camera, and I brought up the idea of an EMP, but she said it would cause too much of a ruckus. It also wasn’t on the list of tools.
 The most obvious answer was a smoke bomb, but I also saw a diagram, where we could cut the electricity. I went with that.
 She then asked what we should do if things went awry and the guards found us. I responded, saying, “I’m going to curl up in a ball and cry.” Iron actually got my sarcasm but wasn’t amused by my joke.
 Unfortunately, the AI demo took what I said literally, and it showed you the result of the attempted heist in the third part. We failed. That joke had serious repercussions, as Bloom gave a rundown in the after-action report.
 He said that my bawling did provide enough distraction for us to escape, but we didn’t get the files. Again, the technology isn’t perfect, but it showed some fascinating gameplay opportunities and unexpected responses.
 Final thoughts
 It seems as though AI in games is still a bit of a ways off, but there are moments where it could be used in subtle gameplay ways.
 That Bloom note is an example of generative AI creating a summary of your actions. That could be helpful if you’re returning to a game after a few months and need to know what you did previously.
 For some of the more ambitious elements, such as the Neo NPCs, that’s going to be much more impactful when it comes to story-driven games.
 It fundamentally changes how video games are written. Although branching dialogue doesn’t need to be written, the characters that game studios create have to be more nuanced and have a deeper background.
 They need to have stories and motivations behind their actions and responses. Writers will need to come up with whether they grew up with pets, who their parents were, what matters to them, and how they perceive the world. It’s up to the writers to put the ghost in the machine.
 In order to bring characters to  life, studios need people who can create compelling characters, and if they don’t, they will appear off to players who are bound to ask them all sorts of questions. Mosser said they’ll hallucinate answers that may not jibe with the fiction.
 That, in turn, will require deeper lore from which the AI bots need to draw from.
 Games have bibles worth of stories that never reach the masses, but having AI bring that up through conversation would be a more immersive way to expose players to that narrative than through walls of texts or random pickups.
 As for the acting, there’s a long way to go before AI can capture the nuance and subtlety of human performances. Many of the character’s performances felt flat compared to human voice acting.
 It’s notable, though, that the characters that stood out in my mind were the confrontational ones. Diego Martinez and Wendy, the robot, left more of an impression than the polite and nice NPCs.
 Although having a game full of Neo NPCs seems a little daunting or far in the future with the amount of storytelling involved, it could be good and doable in spurts.
 It would be a way to bring more narrative depth to the down moments of a campaign. It would create more compelling moments that correspond to the realism that players see in the graphics. – The Mercury News/Tribune News Service",glimpse future game developer conference indie game buzz kernel idea artificial intelligence centre stage nvidia jaw capability chipsets software company ubisoft intriguing gameplay opportunity source hype fear labour conflict hollywood tech industry company efficiency primordial tech ooze video game transformative impact industry enter convai convai company developer tool firsthand project life representative bot guide novice player online game playable character concierge agency player location locale surfboard hang virtual beach notable answer question environment bot term memory recall player raise privacy issue bot speaker profile memory developer memory time stormgate real time strategy game frost giant studio demo character sitrep battlefield demo game npc offer hint project neural nexus impressive demo project neural nexus cyberpunk player situation woman seraph guide player normal scene video game transition bigger fight convai official talk inhabitant walked objective learning fun character money hiccup demo seraph gun hard futuristic sci weapon submachine gun character curious hair cut time hair enemy conversation mae shadow liang character bound law assassin geneva convention trade surprise answer interaction robot wendy robot hostile offence robot shot memorable conversation strange npc elicit strong reaction simple conversation believability demo experience nvidia demo covert protocol inworld technology situation gain access nexalife chief technology officer cto talk gaining doorman tae comedian joke bit tepid guide reception sophia sophia cto wavre hotel policy client privacy bar aware item diego martinez nexalife executive strain write keynote speech colleague standoffish told police sarcastic gruff demo failure convai peel response convai demo diego remember developer technology hand video game company demo neo npc future dystopic player resistance bloom virginie mosser ubisoft narrative director experience conversational gameplay previous demo player objective trust neo npc player bloom fellow resistance fighter megacorporations son child evrand effort trust level time robot prowess player bring subject character front bloom violent positive person boundary question steer conversation mission subtle surreal answer neo npc question pierce base vague answer normal heist demo iron female leader resistance opinion mission break villa steal file yard possibility nearby access window hook tool tree hesitation branch hook idea tool bloom praise mention prior talk generative twist gameplay player character prior military experience dart idea gas idea surveillance camera idea emp ruckus list tool obvious answer smoke bomb diagram cut electricity guard curl ball cry iron sarcasm joke demo attempted heist joke repercussion rundown action report provide distraction escape technology perfect fascinating gameplay opportunity unexpected response final game moment subtle gameplay bloom note generative summary action game month ambitious element neo impactful story game video game dialogue character game studio deeper background story motivation action response writer pet parent matter perceive writer machine bring character life studio people compelling character player sort question hallucinate answer fiction deeper lore bot game bible worth story mass conversation immersive expose player wall text random pickup capture nuance subtlety human performance character performance flat human voice notable character mind confrontational diego martinez wendy robot impression polite nice npc game neo future amount doable spurt narrative depth moment campaign compelling moment realism player mercury news tribune news service,"[(4, 0.99800915)]",4
667998,StarEdu,8,07/04/2024,Is AI a passing fad?,Trends can be distracting when there are issues that need genuine attention,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and ChatGPT are all the rage right now. Generative AI can do some amazing things, like writing essays on a given topic or creating stunning videos simply from text prompts. With such a powerful tool, the possibilities are truly mind-boggling. 
 No wonder companies are jumping onto the AI bandwagon, and those that aren’t run the risk of being seen as falling behind. 
 According to a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, 27% of jobs are at high risk due to the AI revolution. 
 In December last year, the European Parliament passed the world’s first Act on AI, and other nations, including Malaysia, are soon to follow suit.
 Academia has also been caught up in the fervour of AI. Universities across the globe have launched a slew of new programmes in AI, and it has become fertile ground for new research opportunities. 
 Universities dedicated to AI, such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of AI in the Middle East, have even been established. 
 Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir has also recently mooted establishing Malaysia’s first AI polytechnic (An eye on AI, Sunday Star, March 17, 2024).
 Will AI be a game-changer in the way that some evangelists would have us believe? Will it one day even render universities obsolete? Who knows. 
 In this techno-centric world, it’s increasingly hard to distinguish between what might be the beginning of a new dawn, and a trendy new wave that will inevitably pass with time. After all, it was not that long ago that evangelists were touting blockchain and virtual reality (VR) as the next big things. It seems every new technological innovation carries with it a degree of hype. 
 Research firm Gartner even coined a phrase for it, known as the Gartner Hype Cycle, where the hype is at its greatest at the “peak of inflated expectations” before settling down into the “trough of disillusionment”, “scope of enlightenment” and eventual “plateau of productivity”.
 We are also now living in an age of education evangelism. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when universities were forced to conduct teaching and learning remotely, there was a view that online learning would become the new norm. 
 Post-pandemic, this has shown not to be the case, and most universities, including my own, seem to have largely returned to on-campus, face-to-face learning. Yes, perhaps there is now a greater smattering of online lectures and remnants of online assessment, but we’ve largely returned to the old norm rather than embracing a new one. 
 Don’t get me wrong – there are probably more universities offering online degrees than ever before, but it has enhanced or complemented rather than displaced traditional face-to-face learning.
 Even before the global pandemic, massive open online courses (MOOCs) were all the rage and thought to be a disruptor of sorts. Though the major MOOC players are still around, they are hardly thriving, and the MOOC movement has largely come and gone. If one visits the Malaysia MOOC website hosted on openlearning.com, you will find a total of only four courses. 
 In Gartner’s hype cycle, we’ve reached the plateau of productivity. The MOOC evangelists seem to have moved on, as have the gamification and mobile learning evangelists before them. I’m not sure how long the micro-credential evangelists will be around for.
 There’s nothing wrong with getting excited about new innovations, but we should not forget about the basics, like staff development, teacher training, well-equipped classrooms, and reliable Internet access. 
 Truth be told, many of us would prefer to read about the last developments in AI versus the last developments in education pedagogy. The problem comes when such trends become a distraction for issues that deserve genuine attention or worse still, somehow become embedded in strategy, organisational objectives and crude KPIs. 
 In Malaysia, we seem to be a nation obsessed with creating new roadmaps and continually chasing the next big thing. 
 In five years, AI may no longer be the “in-thing”, and the peak of inflated expectations will have passed. But not to worry, because the next “big thing” will have arrived by then to replace it.

668256,Main,17,07/04/2024,Combat drones and AI: Urgently create rules to prevent abuse,,"DRONES, which can be operated away from a battlefield, could bring about the casual use of force, as their operations allow the attacking side not to factor in its own human casualties. International rules must be created urgently.
 In Ukraine, where fierce battles are continuing, both Russia and Ukraine have used drones not only for reconnaissance but also for attacks. The Russian military has utilised self-destructing drones to destroy infrastructure and other facilities in Ukraine, while the Ukrainian military has sunk Russian naval vessels with unmanned surface vehicles.
 Drones have also been used in the Israel war on Gaza, particularly in the killing of senior Hamas members even in Lebanon and Syria.
 The growing use of drones for military purposes appears to stem from their lower cost compared with fighter jets and missiles, as well as their ability to operate continuously for long periods of time.
 Japan has also drawn up plans in its Defence Buildup Program, which was devised in late 2022, to invest a total of ¥1 trillion (RM31.3bil) for the introduction of drones over the five years from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2027. The move is aimed at compensating for a shortage of Self-Defence Forces personnel by replacing manned vehicles with drones.
 China aims to establish technology to launch so-called saturation attacks by flying numerous small drones like a swarm. The Japanese Defence Ministry has been developing laser equipment that will shoot down multiple drones at once. The nation’s defence  system should also be strengthened.
 The use of drones has continued to expand, but drone attacks pose ethical problems.
 As attackers operate drones through monitor screens, they may come to feel as if they are playing a game. That could numb their hesitation to take a human life.
 Particularly due to  the advance of artificial intelligence, there is a possibility that Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), in which AI sets targets and carries out attacks without human judgement, will be put to practical use.
 In recent years, countries such as the United States, China and Russia have been considering international rules related to LAWS, but there are conflicting views between nations that seek strict regulations and others that want to minimise rules. Late last year, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to regulate LAWS.
 The Japanese government has expressed its stance not to develop LAWS and is aiming to first devise a non-legally binding code of conduct.
 Under international humanitarian law, the use of force during a war is confined to military targets and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Regarding the use of drones as well, countries need to reaffirm these regulations in line with such principles as not targeting civilians.
 It goes without saying that AI must not be allowed to make decisions that will take human lives. The Japanese government should lead efforts to create strict, effective rules. — The Yomiuri Shimbun/ANN",drone battlefield casual force operation factor human casualty international rule ukraine fierce battle russia ukraine drone reconnaissance attack russian military utilised drone destroy infrastructure facility ukraine ukrainian military sunk russian naval vessel unmanned surface vehicle drone war gaza senior hamas lebanon syria drone military purpose lower cost fighter jet missile ability period time japan drawn plan buildup program invest total bil introduction drone fiscal fiscal move compensating shortage defence force personnel manned vehicle drone aim technology launch saturation attack numerous drone swarm japanese defence ministry laser equipment shoot multiple drone nation defence system drone drone attack ethical attacker drone monitor screen game numb hesitation human life advance artificial intelligence possibility autonomous weapon system law set target attack human judgement practical country china russia international rule law view nation strict regulation rule united nation law japanese government stance develop law devise code conduct international humanitarian law force war military target attack drone country regulation principle civilian decision human japanese government lead effort strict effective rule ann,"[(3, 0.993938)]",3
668052,Main,31,07/04/2024,Concern over AI use in Gaza war,Guterres decries using cold calculation of algorithms in life and death decisions,"New York: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed serious concern over reports that Israel was using Artificial Intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, resulting in many civilian deaths.
 According to a report in independent Israeli-Palestinian magazine +972, Israel has used AI to identify targets in Gaza – in some cases with as little as 20 seconds of human oversight.
 Guterres said that he was “deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military’s bombing campaign includes Artificial Intelligence as a tool in the identification of targets, particularly in densely populated residential areas, resulting in a high level of civilian casualties.”
 “No part of life and death decisions which impact entire families should be delegated to the cold calculation of algorithms,” he said.
 The +972 report claims that “the Israeli army has marked tens of thousands of Gazans as suspects for assassination, using an AI targeting system with little human oversight and a permissive policy for casualties”.
 The report said that, according to “six Israeli intelligence officers”, a system dubbed Lavender had “played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war”.
 “According to the sources, its influence on the military’s operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine ‘as if it were a human decision’,” +972 reported.
 Two sources said “the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians”.
 The Israeli army, known as the IDF, on Friday rejected the claims.
 “The IDF does not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist,” it said.
 Instead it has a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources... on the military operatives of terrorist organisations” to be used as a tool for analysts, it added.
 “The IDF does not carry out strikes when the expected collateral damage from the strike is excessive,” it said, using a term that includes civilian casualties.
 Israel began hyping AI-powered targeting after an 11-day conflict in Gaza during May 2021, which commanders branded the world’s “first AI war”.
 The military chief during the 2021 war, Aviv Kochavi, told Israeli news website Ynet last year the force had used AI systems to identify “100 new targets every day”, instead of 50 a year previously.
 Weeks into the latest Gaza war, a blog entry on the Israeli military’s website said its AI-enhanced “targeting directorate” had identified more than 12,000 targets in just 27 days.
 An unnamed Israeli official was quoted as saying the AI system, called Gospel, produced targets “for precise attacks on infrastructure associated with Hamas, inflicting great damage on the enemy and minimal harm to those not involved”.
 But an anonymous former Israeli intelligence officer, quoted in November by +972, described Gospel’s work as creating a “mass assassination factory”.
 In a rare confession of wrongdoing, Israel on Friday admitted a series of errors and violations of its rules in the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza, saying it had mistakenly believed it was “targeting armed Hamas operatives”.
 Alessandro Accorsi, a senior analyst at Crisis Group, said the +972 report was “very concerning”.
 “It feels very apocalyptic. It’s clear... the degree of human control is very low,” he said.
 “There are a thousand questions around this obviously – how moral it is to use it – but it is hardly surprising it is used,” he said. — AFP",york secretary antonio guterres concern report artificial intelligence identify target civilian death report independent israeli palestinian magazine israel identify target human oversight guterres troubled report israeli military bombing campaign artificial intelligence tool identification target residential level civilian casualty life death decision entire family cold calculation report claim israeli army ten thousand gazans suspect assassination system human permissive policy casualty israeli intelligence officer system played central role palestinian stage war source influence military operation output machine human decision source week war junior hamas operative lavender permissible kill civilian israeli army idf friday claim artificial intelligence system identifies operative person terrorist database purpose cross reference intelligence source military operative organisation analyst carry strike collateral damage strike excessive term civilian casualty day conflict gaza commander war military chief war aviv kochavi israeli news website ynet force system identify target day week war blog entry israeli military website directorate target day israeli official system gospel target precise attack infrastructure inflicting damage enemy minimal harm anonymous israeli intelligence officer november gospel mass assassination factory rare confession israel friday series error violation rule aid worker hamas alessandro accorsi senior analyst crisis report feel apocalyptic degree human control low question moral surprising afp,"[(8, 0.9948983)]",8
667946,StarBiz 7,2,06/04/2024,PayNet all set to jump on the AI bandwagon,,"TRADITIONAL payments are increasingly being replaced by digital payments in Malaysia, as the nation strives towards becoming a cashless society.
 This trend is especially prevalent following the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the transition and change in people’s views on money.
 According to a Bank Negara report, e-payment adoption among Malaysians had risen to 11.5 billion transactions in 2023 from 9.3 billion in the previous year.
 Despite the clear signs that e-payment is on the rise, Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (PayNet) group chief executive officer Farhan Ahmad says digital payments will not completely replace cash payments, rather both will continue to co-exist in the coming years.
 Speaking with StarBizWeek, he says accepting cash payments makes sense for some people, particularly for small businesses as having the ability to visualise cash in hand provides greater assurance.
 “I do not see cash going away fully any time soon,” he says, while acknowledging that digital payments are still much better than cash due to the benefits of convenience, efficiency, security and data value to businesses and consumers.
 The notion of digital payments being unsafe and risky is inaccurate, Farhan points out, adding that there are also risks in carrying cash in hand, as it can lead to a loss, be it accidental or theft.
 Since the majority of consumers tend to opt for digital payments, businesses may lose a fraction of their earnings if these businesses choose not to offer a digital payment alternative, he says.
 PayNet is a payment network and financial market infrastructure provider in Malaysia. Among the services it offers are Interbank Giro, JomPAY, DuitNow and shared ATM network and MEPS ATM.
 Recognising the vast opportunities that artificial intelligence (AI) offers, Farhan says PayNet is jumping on the technology bandwagon to strengthen Malaysia’s participation in the field.
 He notes AI is becoming a ubiquitous presence in everyday life, as it revolutionises the finance industry and offers consumers a safer and more inventive platform.
 One of the main challenges in advancing Malaysia’s journey towards AI, however, is the large sum of investments needed to adopt the technology.
 “AI requires massive investments and raising several hundred million ringgit will not be enough,” Farhan says.
 He explains that the group is currently collaborating with several researchers within the AI space, as well as from Imperial College London and Oxford University to find ways to set foot into the space and be a part of the discussion.
 Farhan says the group has also inked agreements with several companies to kickstart research on AI, and that PayNet is eager to collaborate with other Asian countries for this move towards further innovation.
 We have to make this country better and easier for financial technologies to come in because the opportunities that Malaysia presents are amazing, he adds.
 He reveals PayNet has a few AI projects up its sleeves with a focus on security, data privacy as well as creating a localised large language model for Malaysia.
 He adds that PayNet’s first venture into the world of AI will be in terms of security use cases, as it is one of the primary areas that will be exploited by malicious intentions.
 PayNet is in it for the long run as the main objective of adopting AI is to use it to protect the rakyat.
 “Being one of the nation’s guardians of the financial systems, I am confident in PayNet’s position as one of the top organisations and systems globally that utilise AI not only for growth, but also for the nation’s security and data privacy as well,” he says.
 Moving forward, PayNet highlights the significance of achieving shared prosperity, and as a digital payment platform, it needs to have a strong and comprehensive vision for the next few decades.In this regard, Farhan says it is imperative to have a robust public-private partnership to leverage digital payments as the true enabler of economic prosperity, as it will not only benefit the company, but also the public at large.
 He adds PayNet is looking to develop new projects in Melaka, Johor and Sabah, as well as in fields that have yet to be covered as an effort to create shared prosperity and grow digital payments automatically.",traditional payment digital payment malaysia nation cashless society trend prevalent covid pandemic transition change people view money bank negara report payment adoption transaction previous sign payment rise payment network malaysia sdn bhd paynet chief executive officer ahmad digital payment cash payment starbizweek cash payment people business ability visualise cash hand assurance cash time digital payment cash benefit convenience efficiency security data business consumer digital payment unsafe risky inaccurate farhan risk cash hand lead loss accidental theft majority consumer opt digital payment business lose fraction earnings business offer digital payment alternative paynet payment network financial market infrastructure provider malaysia service interbank giro jompay duitnow atm network meps vast opportunity artificial intelligence offer paynet jumping technology bandwagon strengthen malaysia participation field note ubiquitous presence everyday life finance industry consumer inventive platform main challenge malaysia journey sum investment technology massive investment ringgit farhan researcher space imperial college london oxford university foot space discussion farhan agreement company paynet eager collaborate asian country innovation country easier financial technology opportunity reveals paynet project sleeve security data privacy localised language model malaysia paynet venture term security primary malicious intention main objective adopting rakyat nation financial system confident paynet position top organisation system utilise growth nation security data privacy paynet highlight significance prosperity digital payment platform strong comprehensive vision decade farhan imperative robust public private partnership leverage digital payment true economic prosperity company public paynet develop project johor sabah field effort create prosperity grow digital payment,"[(11, 0.85066354), (13, 0.14561577)]",11
667402,StarProperty,8,05/04/2024,Facing tomorrow: Enhancing real estate with technology and AI,Developers are making strides but digitalisation is slow,"By Liew Jia Yi (Yanika)
 yanika.liew@thestar.com.my
 For the average person, social media today has rapidly taken over the role of information broker. With its own ecosystem for news ranging from celebrities to real-time business upheavals, platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and TikTok spearhead hot-button issues of today’s culture. 
 So it comes to no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) technology is creeping into the real estate industry. Such systems learn the pattern and behaviour of human users, so imagine its capabilities in the future, Ian Scott Inteltech managing director Mohd Izharudin Amanudin said during the 31st National Real Estate Convention.
 The AI system receives more data through constant usage and in turn, becomes more enhanced. Today’s algorithms are only the beginning. In real estate, AI can offer solutions to streamline processes like property valuation, enhance customer experience and identify valuable opportunities, Izharudin said. 
 He pointed to increased lead generation. Through predictive analysis, AI could identify potential buyers. When it comes to repeat clients, the system would be able to learn the intricacies of customer preferences and provide personalised solutions.
 The AI can improve the homeownership process, where a system can keep track of loans and other factors that impact homebuyers while retrieving and analysing data on the property market.
 “Property valuation and pricing can be much more precise based on market demand and historical data, there is a lot of historical data by the system,” Izharudin said.
 He pointed out that these insights could feasibly provide risk mitigation. Investment in AI would also mean investment in a system that has the tools to identify solutions to these risks.
 “These systems provide a competitive advantage in identifying emerging trends. For example, in new housing areas, they have a new lifestyle, what do they want? You learn the pattern. So we need a new system to enhance – not to take over the job – but to enhance the job,” he added.
 This is similar in the case of marketing, especially when it comes to digital platforms and applications targeted to home solutions, Izharudin said.
 Developers today have already begun promoting applications for property management, encompassing homeowner tasks such as rent collection, maintenance scheduling and visitor registration. While these are not yet in the scope of AI, it is easy to see how improved technology would be able to further enhance the homeowner experience.
 Analysis of large chunks of data could be done very quickly, utilising the system instead of human resources. This could also add to cost-saving measures as the cost of human resources increases. The system would be able to monitor amenities such as the water tank, lift and other utilities.
 With a detailed map of each property, security would easily be manageable through the AI system. Whether in the form of facial recognition, identification or safety measures, Izharudin noted that the system would make it easier to monitor fire hazards or detect firearms.
 A developer problem
 “The shift from the brick-and-mortar way to digitalisation of the sales process is inevitable in Malaysia. It shows that the technology is an enabler for us to unlock the next level of the business potential,” PKNS general manager of corporate finance and strategy Netty Hezreena Abd Malek said.
 “We as a property developer in PKNS face two main challenges when it comes to sales and marketing, so first, end financing challenges and the second one is lack of adoption of digital marketing tools,” she pointed out.
 Based on a 2022 Real Estate And Housing Developers' Association (Rehda) Institute report, a significant number of total loans applied for residential purchases were not approved due to ineligibility, lowered margin of financing, as well as inadequate documentation. 
 However, real estate agents and developer sales teams would have no way of knowing this information beforehand. 
 “This process frustration is wasted time for our sales team, so if we can screen the prospect earlier, then it will allow us more time for us to focus on closing high-quality leads,” Netty said.
 She pointed out that according to the report, 48% of property developers spend less than RM400,000 on digital marketing tools, despite 67% acknowledging the impact of digital marketing initiatives.
 The factors that contribute to a lack of investment in digital marketing tools is because of the lack of competent people handling the technology platform. The second is the high cost of the software itself, Netty noted.
 “So we came up with a good solution for us to try to establish a centralised function of marketing and sales. With this, it allows us to leverage on the right competencies plus the technology to be advertised to a larger base,” she said.
 PKNS’ centralised digital platform, PKNS Hartanah Elite, is part of the developer strategy to include the closing of the sales process in digitalisation. From the signing of listings to buying inventory, the platform can give value to stakeholders across transactions.
 “This is how we want to improve our profitability and enhance our asset valuations. We are using Proptech as a service. This platform has improved in terms of capability in project management. We understand that the most effective lead generation is coming from the agent, so we are focusing on facilitating agents that we have on board,” Netty said. 
 The platform would allow the agent to upload, manage, track and use a single price chart. It was also equipped with a developer dashboard, with live price charts, real-time project health, appointment, booking, loan applications and advanced analytics by demographic.
 The application would be included to display the margin of financing for a certain area, as well as individual bank approval rates.
 “So, out of this dashboard, we have sales management and financial institution integration, so buyers can proactively select and apply for products from various banks. Instead of submitting multiple applications, buyers can submit a single application that will be transmitted to multiple banks,” Netty pointed out.
 Through seamless digital integration, stakeholders from homebuyers, agents, banks and developers, will be able to enjoy increased operational efficiency.
 Missing parts
 While digital marketing and AI progression promise efficiency, Izharudin noted that there are still challenges and limitations to implementing AI and digitalisation in real estate. 
 “Data bias. It can be right, it can be wrong, it may not be accurate, again it depends on the data that it receives,” Izharudin said.
 ChatGPT itself is notorious for hallucinating information, and as it stands, there is an increased concern for data security. Lack of proper regulation stifles the environment from which such strides in technology can flourish.
 “There is a difficulty in trusting their decision, sometimes the decisions made by the AI itself can be questionable because again as I said, the machines are still learning. When we design the system, the data that we receive must be accurate,” Izharudin said.
 “Do we still need humans? Yes, to decide what to ask and how to provide context, legal compliance, et cetera. To compensate for AI weakness, we need humans,” he added.",liew jia liew average person social medium role broker news celebrity real time business upheaval instagram twitter tiktok spearhead hot button issue culture artificial intelligence technology real estate industry system pattern behaviour human user capability future ian scott inteltech director mohd izharudin amanudin national real estate convention system data constant usage algorithm real estate offer solution property valuation customer experience identify valuable opportunity lead generation predictive analysis potential buyer client system learn intricacy customer preference personalised solution homeownership process system track loan factor homebuyers data property market property valuation pricing precise market demand historical data historical data system izharudin insight risk mitigation investment investment system identify solution risk system competitive advantage trend housing lifestyle pattern system job enhance job marketing digital platform application solution izharudin developer application property management homeowner task rent collection maintenance visitor registration scope easy technology enhance homeowner experience analysis chunk system human resource cost saving cost human resource system monitor amenity water tank lift utility map property security manageable system form facial recognition identification safety measure system easier monitor fire hazard firearm shift brick mortar digitalisation sale process inevitable malaysia technology enabler unlock level business potential pkns manager corporate finance strategy netty hezreena abd malek property developer pkns main challenge sale financing challenge adoption digital marketing tool real estate housing developer institute report total loan residential purchase ineligibility margin inadequate documentation real estate agent sale team process frustration time sale screen prospect earlier time focus quality netty report property developer digital marketing tool impact digital marketing initiative factor lack investment digital marketing tool competent people technology platform cost software netty solution function marketing sale leverage competency technology larger base pkns digital platform pkns hartanah developer strategy sale process digitalisation signing listing inventory platform stakeholder transaction profitability enhance asset valuation service platform term capability project management effective lead generation agent agent board agent upload manage track single price chart developer live price chart real time project health appointment loan application analytics demographic application display margin individual bank approval rate sale management financial institution integration buyer apply product bank multiple application buyer single application multiple bank seamless digital integration stakeholder homebuyers agent bank developer operational efficiency digital marketing progression promise efficiency izharudin limitation digitalisation real estate data bias wrong accurate depends receives izharudin notorious stand increased concern data security proper regulation environment stride technology flourish difficulty decision decision questionable machine design system data accurate izharudin human context legal compliance cetera compensate weakness human,"[(5, 0.5862802), (12, 0.41154647)]",5

665637,Lifestyle,4,01/04/2024,Mapping mortality    through AI,Danish researchers are exploring algorithms to estimate life expectancy and delving into the impact of social bonds on our health and longevity.,"RESEARCHERS in Denmark are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) and data from millions of people to help anticipate the stages of an individual’s life all the way to the end, hoping to raise awareness of the technology’s power and its perils.
 Far from any morbid fascinations, the creators of life2vec want to explore patterns and relationships that so-called deep-learning programmes can uncover to predict a wide range of health or social “life-events”.“It’s a very general framework for making predictions about human lives. It can predict anything where you have training data,” said Sune Lehmann, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and one of the authors of a study recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science.For Lehmann, the possibilities are endless. “It could predict health outcomes. So it could predict fertility or obesity, or you could maybe predict who will get cancer or who doesn’t get cancer. But it could also predict if you’re going to make a lot of money,” he said.
 The algorithm uses a similar process as that of ChatGPT, but instead it analyses variables impacting life such as birth, education, social benefits or even work schedules.
 The team is trying to adapt the innovations that enabled language-processing algorithms to “examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences”.
 “From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the paediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on,” Lehmann said.
 Yet the disclosure of the program quickly spawned claims of a new “death calculator”, with some fraudulent sites duping people with offers to use the AI program for a life expectancy prediction – often in exchange for submitting personal data.
 The researchers insist the software is private and unavailable on the Internet or to the wider research community for now.
 Data from six million
 The basis for the life2vec model is the anonymised data of around six million Danes, collected by the official Statistics Denmark agency.
 By analysing sequences of events, it is possible to predict life outcomes right up until the last breath.
 When it comes to predicting death, the algorithm is right in 78% of cases; when it comes to predicting if a person will move to another city or country, it is correct in 73% of cases.
 “We look at early mortality. So we take a very young cohort between 35 and 65. Then we try to predict, based on an eight-year period from 2008 to 2016, if a person dies in the subsequent four years,” Lehmann said.
 “The model can do that really well, better than any other algorithm that we could find,” he said.According to the researchers, focusing on this age bracket, where deaths are usually few and far between, allows them to verify the algorithm’s reliability.
 However, the tool is not yet ready for use outside of a research setting.
 “For now, it’s a research project where we’re exploring what’s possible and what’s not possible,” Lehmann said.
 He and his colleagues also want to explore long-term outcomes as well as the impact that social connections have on life and health.‘Public counterpoint’
 For the researchers, the project presents a scientific counterweight to the heavy investments into AI algorithms by large technology companies.
 “They can also build models like this, but they’re not making them public. They’re not talking about them,” Lehmann said.
 “They’re just building them to, hopefully for now, sell you more advertisements, or sell more advertisements and sell you more products.”
 He said it was “important to have an open and public counterpoint to begin to understand what can even happen with data like this”.
 This was especially true, according to Pernille Tranberg, a Danish expert on data ethics, because organisations like insurance companies were already using similar algorithms.
 “They probably put you into groups and say, ‘Okay, you have a chronic disease, the risk is this and this’,” Tranberg said.
 “It can be used against us to discriminate (against) us so that you will have to pay a higher insurance premium, or you can’t get a loan from the bank, or you can’t get public healthcare because you’re going to die anyway,” she said.
 When it comes to predicting our own demise, some developers have already tried to make such algorithms commercial.
 “On the Web, we’re already seeing prediction clocks, which show how old we’re going to get,” Tranberg said. “Some of them aren’t at all reliable.” – AFP",researcher artificial intelligence data million people stage individual life awareness technology power peril fascination creator life vec explore pattern relationship deep learning programme wide range health social life event prediction human data sune lehmann professor technical university denmark dtu author journal nature computational science lehmann possibility predict health outcome fertility obesity cancer cancer lot money algorithm process chatgpt variable life birth education social benefit schedule adapt innovation language processing algorithm examine evolution predictability human detailed event sequence life event people visit paediatrician start school move location lehmann disclosure program claim death calculator fraudulent people offer program life expectancy prediction exchange personal data researcher software private unavailable internet wider community data basis life model data dane official statistic denmark agency sequence event life outcome death algorithm person city country mortality cohort period person subsequent lehmann model algorithm researcher age bracket death algorithm reliability tool ready setting project lehmann colleague term outcome social connection life health public counterpoint researcher scientific counterweight heavy investment technology company model public lehmann building sell advertisement advertisement product public counterpoint understand data true pernille tranberg danish expert data ethic organisation insurance company chronic disease risk discriminate pay insurance premium loan bank public healthcare die demise developer commercial web prediction clock reliable afp,"[(11, 0.9952614)]",11
665641,Lifestyle,5,01/04/2024,Anguilla’s unexpected AI windfall,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence’s integration into everyday life has stirred up doubts and unsettling questions for many about humanity’s path forward. But in Anguilla, a tiny Caribbean island to the east of Puerto Rico, the AI boom has made the country a fortune.
 The British territory collects a fee from every registration for Internet addresses that end in “.ai”, which happens to be the domain name assigned to the island, like “.fr” for France and  “.jp” for Japan. With companies wanting Internet addresses that communicate they are at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Elon Musk’s X.ai website for his AI company, Anguilla has recently received a huge influx of requests for domain names.
 For each domain registration, Anguilla’s government gets anywhere from US$140 (RM665) to thousands of dollars from website names sold at auctions, according to government data. Last year, Anguilla’s government made about US$32mil (RM151.7mil) from those fees.
 That amounted to more than 10% of the gross domestic product for the territory of almost 16,000 people and 91 square kilometres.
 “Some people call it a windfall,” said Anguilla’s premier, Ellis Webster. “We just call it God smiling down on us.”
 Webster said the government used the money to provide free healthcare for citizens 70 and older, and it has committed millions of dollars to finish building a school and a vocational training centre.
 The government has also allocated funds to improve its airport, doubled its budget for sports activities, events and facilities, and increased the budget for citizens seeking medical treatment overseas, he said.
 The island, which relies heavily on tourism, had been hard hit by the pandemic’s restrictions on travel and a devastating hurricane in 2017.
 The .ai domain income was the boost the country needed. “We never thought that it would have this potential,” Webster said.
 Anguilla’s control of .ai dates to the early days of the Internet, when nations and territories were assigned their slice of cyberspace. Anguilla received .ai, and its government, whose own site is www.gov.ai., did not make much of it until the domain names started bringing in millions.
 Officials are uncertain how long the boon will last, but they predicted 2024 would bring in similar income as last year from domain names.
 It is not the first bonanza to make a big difference to a grateful domain owner. Tuvalu, a string of islands northwest of Australia, sold the rights to its suffix, “.tv”, to a Canadian entrepreneur for US$50mil (RM237mil), and used the money to bring electricity to the outer islands, create scholarships and finance the process of joining the United Nations.
 The South Pacific island of Niue, on the other hand, gave an American businessman the rights to its “.nu” suffix in the 1990s in exchange for connecting it to the Internet.
 The island later claimed to have been cheated out of cash that came through the sale of the domain name to thousands of Scandinavians attracted by the suffix “nu”, which means “now” in Swedish, Danish and Dutch.
 But Anguilla realised early enough that it could not let this unexpected jackpot slip away.

665645,Lifestyle,6,01/04/2024,AI copyright clash,,"FRANCE’S competition watchdog said it fined Alphabet’s Google €250mil (RM1.28bil) for breaches linked to EU intellectual property rules in its relationship with media publishers, citing concerns about the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) service.
 The watchdog said Google’s AI-powered chatbot Bard, since rebranded under the name Gemini, was trained on content from publishers and news agencies, without notifying them.
 Google has pledged not to contest the facts as part of settlement proceedings, the watchdog said, adding that the company has also proposed a series of remedy measures for certain shortcomings.Google said it accepted the settlement “because it is time to move on”, adding that “we want to focus on the larger goal of sustainable approaches to connecting people with quality content and on working constructively with French publishers”.
 The company said the fine was disproportionate and said the watchdog had not sufficiently taken into account its efforts “in an environment where it’s very hard to set a course because we can’t predict which way the wind will blow next”.
 The fine is linked to a copyright dispute in France over online content in a case triggered by complaints from some of the country’s biggest news organisations, including Agence France Presse (AFP).
 The dispute appeared to be resolved in 2022 when the US tech giant dropped its appeal against an initial €500mil (RM2.56bil) fine issued at the end of a major investigation carried out by the Autorite de la Concurrence.
 In a statement, the watchdog said Google violated the terms of four out of seven commitments agreed in the settlement, including conducting negotiations with publishers in good faith and providing transparent information.
 The watchdog in particular cited Google’s AI chatbot Bard, which it launched in 2023, which it said was trained on data from unspecified media outlets and news agencies without the company informing them or the regulator.
 “Subsequently, Google linked the use of the content concerned by its AI service to the display of protected content”, the watchdog said, adding that in doing so, Google hindered the ability of publishers and press agencies to negotiate  fair prices.
 The fine comes as many publishers, writers and newsrooms seek to limit the scraping – or automatic collection of data – by AI services of their online content without their consent or fair compensation.
 The New York Times in 2023 sued Google rivals Microsoft and OpenAI, the creators of the popular artificial-intelligence platform ChatGPT, accusing them of using millions of the newspaper’s articles without permission to help train chatbots.

 At TM R&D, the primary focus of AI implementation has been to deliver exceptional customer service. 
 “It is also crucial to be aware of and mitigate biases that may be present in AI algorithms,” she added. 
 Moving forward, Sharlene said the company had embarked on experiments with large language models (LLM), in late 2022, to elicit user responses, paving the way for its new generative AI-powered interactive and help agent development. 
 AISHA makes use of the LLM, a subset of generative AI created to produce responses that take context into account, adjust to the conversational style of users, and generally react by understanding the meaning of phrases. 
 “This is in contrast to a traditional chatbot that often relies on pre-determined rules and structures, providing generic responses without a comprehensive understanding of the broader context of the conversation,” she added. 
 Additionally, she said TM R&D anticipates LLM to be ubiquitous across several domains and applied across other diverse business concerns. 
 “For example, the application of LLM in chat prompts and a combination of troubleshooting tools had resulted in autonomous resolution issues,” she said. 
 Aside from the LLM AI system, the group also targets to release other systems that leverage predictive analysis as well as generative AI soon. 
 On a separate note, TM R&D had inked a memorandum of understanding with ZTE Malaysia Corp Sdn Bhd to collaborate on a range of R&D innovations under its latest strategic partnership programme.

664551,StarBiz,7,29/03/2024,Demand from auto and AI to lift chip industry,Resilient second quarter likely for tech sector,"PETALING JAYA: MIDF Research expects a stronger second  quarter for the technology sector as the semiconductor industry is poised to recover this year.
 In its “Awaiting the cuts 2Q24 market outlook”, the research house said it was maintain its “neutral” stance as the automotive and artificial intelligence (AI) related market could bring in a larger proportion of total sales.
 It noted for the first half of last year, the rebound in semiconductor sales mainly stemmed from the automotive and industrial sectors as well as the growing demand for a range of chips that are critical to AI systems.
 “However, the communication end markets would still command the largest market share. 
 “Moving forward, while the communication end market would still play an important role, we anticipate a higher proportion of sales coming from the automotive and AI-related end market,” it said.
 Quoting the Semiconductor Industry Association, MIDF Research said market growth is projected to continue over the remainder of the year, with annual sales forecast to increase by 13.1% in 2024 to US$588.4bil compared with last year. 
 “January semiconductor industry sales improved by 15.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) to US$47.6bil, the highest growth rate since May 2022. 
 “This indicates that the monthly sales should be on an upward trajectory to achieve the forecast, except for February given the shorter working days,” it noted.
 Meanwhile, shipments of the iPhone to China had dropped 33% in February and had notably declined by 24% y-o-y in the first six weeks of this year.
 “This has also led Apple’s market share of the Chinese smartphone market to decline to 15.7%, placing it in fourth place from the second place a year ago. 
 “On the contrary, Huawei posted a growth of 64% y-o-y thanks to its homegrown Mate 60 Pro devices,” MIDF Research said.The research house explained the concerns led Apple Inc to offer discounts on its iPhone on top of allowing its partner vendors in China to offer discounts to spur demand.
 “We view that this could have a trickle-down effect in terms of volume order and cost down from Apple to its supply chain,” it said.
 Additionally, the Biden administration’s consideration of blacklisting some Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies Co is likely to further strain the US-China trade relations as the United States seeks to suppress China’s AI and semiconductor ambitions. 
 The report said the companies include chipmakers Qingdao Si’eEn, SwaySure, Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co. as well as China’s leading memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc.
 “The US government is also asking the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, and Japan to further tighten restrictions on China’s access to semiconductor technology. We view that Malaysian outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) providers would not be impacted by the sanctions surrounding Huawei, but will have a positive spillover effect on Malaysia as the China +1 strategy would continue to be deployed,” MIDF Research said.
 The trade war escalation would cause Chinese semiconductor firms to look for Malaysian OSAT providers to mitigate the potential risk of broader sanctions.
 Separately, MIDF Research said there is potential for the government to award more contracts to information technology  companies  that provide e-government and information technology services.
 “We believe that MyEG Services Bhd could potentially benefit via its recently acquired 14.4% stake in HeiTech Padu Bhd,” it said.
 MIDF Research noted that Datasonic Group Bhd was awarded a six month extension contract worth RM135mil until May.

664579,StarBiz,9,29/03/2024,Experts stress importance of responsible AI growth,,"BEIJING: No country, including the United States, can single-handedly lead the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), and only global cooperation can ensure that AI will remain safe and beneficial for all, say experts and company executives at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Boao, Hainan province. 
 Their remarks were an attempt to address “AI anxiety” among sections of the Chinese AI industry following the launch of text-to-video generator Sora by US firm OpenAI.
 Zeng Yi, a researcher of the Institute of Automation, which is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the United Nations High-level Advisory Body on AI, said: “The US will not lead the future AI development alone, nor will China. Unless we move forward hand in hand, no country will.”
 Zeng emphasised that AI is a foundational technology and an enabler.
 “The world is vast enough to allow China, the United States and many other countries to find their own opportunities in building infrastructure and driving applications.
 “If the culture of China differs from that of the United States, then please provide a profound understanding of how a different culture might envision the empowerment of technology in the future and how we can deeply integrate science and humanity to offer more possibilities for the world.”
 The more pressing issue, he said, is how the world can unite to truly develop AI that is safer, more reliable and more trustworthy.
 Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading AI researcher, said that competition in the field is by and large healthy, but the idea of a zero-sum game is a “huge mistake”.
 “If AI can be created to be safe and beneficial, and more capable than human beings, then it can function as a source of unlimited wealth,” he said. “In that sense, there is no need to compete for such technology.”
 Russell further said that a more important issue is to coexist healthily and safely with this technology, which is still an open question for the world.

663963,StarBiz,11,27/03/2024,Microsoft Bing chief exiting role after Suleyman named AI leader,,"NEW YORK: Microsoft Corp’s Mikhail Parakhin, head of the company’s Bing search engine and advertising businesses, will exit those roles and look for a new position, a week after the software giant named Mustafa Suleyman to oversee consumer artificial intelligence (AI) work and asked Parakhin to report to him.
 Parakhin, who had been chief executive officer for advertising and web services, will report to chief technology officer Kevin Scott while searching for his next role, Microsoft said.
 Parakhin also oversaw some parts of the company’s Windows software business. That work will be shifted to Pavan Davuluri, who had been overseeing hardware and the rest of Windows. 
 Davuluri will now run all of Windows and Surface hardware, reporting to executive vice-president Rajesh Jha, who disclosed the changes in a staff email Monday. 
 Jha’s email and a spokesperson didn’t specify if Parakhin was likely to leave Microsoft or take a new role within the company.
 Parakhin’s exit from a core part of the company’s consumer AI products marks the first shuffle stemming from chief executive officer Satya Nadella’s move last week to install Suleyman, a co-founder of AI researcher DeepMind, as head of a unified push in the space.
 The move illustrated Nadella’s impatience with his team’s efforts, two people familiar with his thinking said last week.

663501,StarMetro,6,26/03/2024,"Experts: Adapt to AI, don’t fear it","Workers need to retrain, upskill, innovate to work alongside machine intelligence","ALTHOUGH artificial intelligence (AI) will have a big impact on businesses and people’s lives, employees should adapt rather than fear it, say industry experts in George Town, Penang.
 Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association president Datuk Seri Wong Siew Hai said AI would likely replace humans in the supply chain management and production line, but not all jobs would be at risk.
 “For example, jobs that require emotional intelligence, empathy and personal interaction as well as judgement, like journalism and human resources, are not under threat.
 “These jobs involve creativity and innovative problem-solving, which are challenging for AI to replicate,” said Wong.
 He also pointed out that jobs such as repair work that needed physical adaptability and dexterity in variable conditions were difficult for AI and robots to perform conclusively.
 “The more complex a job is and the more domains it cuts into, the less likely would AI be able to replace humans,” he said. 
 He explained that the speed and extent of AI adoption would depend on economical and ethical considerations, adaptability of workers and nature of the work.
 Wong gave the example of quality control as one area where an AI system with advanced image recognition capabilities, would be a preferred choice.
 “Here, AI should be more accurate in predicting when machines will need maintenance, reducing downtime and need for constant human monitoring.
 “In supply chain management, AI can handle forecasts, fulfilment and inventory management through data analysis and modelling,” he added.
 In 2022, it was reported that there were about 2.72 million people employed in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia, with 590,000 workers alone in the electrical and electronics industry.
 Wong thinks the debate on whether AI will replace humans will continue but that people should learn from similar claims about automation in the past.
 “In reality, automation actually pushes people to work better and find more value-added functions.
 “Those who have a positive perception will embrace it and shift their skills, but this necessitates retraining and upskilling for many workers,” said Wong.
 Small and Medium Enterprises Association Malaysia national secretary Yeoh Seng Hooi said employees needed to reskill and upskill themselves to stay relevant, especially those doing manual repetitive jobs.
 “When it comes to new development and innovation, you need the human factor as the human mind cannot be replaced.
 “We have to start training people to use their thinking cap more, instead of just hard labour,” said Yeoh. 
 He predicted that fields like warehouse management would likely go the way of AI but that human input for design, sales and marketing was still required.
 “In certain departments, the number of employees will go down but pay for skilled workers will increase and the company will still save money,” he said.
 Wong and Yeoh’s views come at a time when the impact of AI is a concern, especially on jobs and ethics.

663609,StarBiz,9,26/03/2024,Cook tells forum AI is key for climate battle,Apple pouring huge investments into developing tool,"BEIJING: Apple Inc chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook said artificial intelligence (AI) is an essential tool for helping businesses reduce their carbon footprint, as he joined a climate change dialog last Sunday at the China Development Forum (CDF).
 Cook took part in a discussion at the annual Beijing event as the culmination of a week of public displays of his company’s commitment to China. 
 He earlier met Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and announced plans to invest further in Apple’s supply chain, stores and research in the country.
 Apple has set some of the most ambitious targets among its peers for reducing its carbon footprint – with the Apple Watch touted as its first carbon-neutral product. 
 Cook focused on that theme in his remarks and for much of his visit.
 “We are making great progress, we are not there yet, and the road ahead requires more innovation,” Cook said of the company’s environmental goals.
 Apple is pouring substantial investment and resources into its AI development, not least because it has been surpassed by more aggressive competitors like OpenAI with its ChatGPT.
 AI “provides an enormous toolkit for every company that’s wishing to be carbon-neutral or lower their emissions by a substantial amount,” the 63-year-old chief executive officer said. It can help businesses calculate an individual person’s carbon footprint, identify materials available for recovery and offer strategies for recycling.
 Like Apple, China’s leading tech companies are racing to get ahead in the AI contest. However, US trade sanctions have curbed their access to the best semiconductors for the task, made by Nvidia Corp.
 The Apple chief returned to the CDF at a time when Beijing wants to show it is open for business. Cook was also one of the marquee names on last year’s list of participants, which was the first time the event was held in-person after three years of Covid isolation. He spoke with China premier Li Qiang and other CEOs of international corporations following Li’s opening speech. 
 Cook told reporters that he had visited China frequently over the past year because “it’s so vibrant and so dynamic here, I just always enjoy coming.” His social team documented on his Weibo profile visits with supply partners and a small coffee-making business using Apple technology.
 “To make the best products we need partners who share our commitment to innovation and protecting the planet,” Cook said in one of the posts, lauding suppliers BYD Co, Lens Technology Co and Shenzhen Everwin Precision Technology Co. He also praised coffeemaker Saturnbird for recycling its coffee grounds and containers.
 The environmental theme to Cook’s trip – which included opening an expansive new store in Shanghai – may have been chosen to avoid falling afoul of geopolitical sensitivities. Relations between the United States and China have continued to deteriorate, with threats to ban ByteDance Ltd’s TikTok in the United States if its Chinese owner doesn’t divest.
 Apple has been on the receiving end of China’s riposte, as it’s had to navigate an escalated ban on iPhones in Chinese government-run or state-backed businesses.
 The company’s global corporate operations are now carbon neutral and it aims to have net-zero climate impact across its entire business by 2030. That would include manufacturing supply chains and the full product life cycle.
 Apple has also set the goal of eliminating plastic from its product packaging by 2025. 
 When it removed the exterior plastic wrap in its iPhone 13 packaging, Apple avoided 600 tonnes of waste, showing the impact of even small changes when scaled across a vast manufacturing network.
 It produces hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs each year, mostly in China. — Bloomberg",apple chief executive officer ceo tim cook artificial intelligence essential tool business carbon footprint climate change dialog sunday china development forum cdf cook discussion annual beijing event culmination week public display company commitment china commerce minister wang wentao plan apple supply chain store country apple ambitious target peer carbon footprint apple watch carbon neutral product cook theme remark progress road innovation cook company environmental goal apple substantial investment resource development aggressive competitor chatgpt enormous toolkit company carbon neutral lower emission substantial amount chief executive officer business individual person carbon footprint identify material recovery offer apple china tech company contest trade sanction access semiconductor nvidia corp apple chief cdf time business cook marquee name list participant time event person covid isolation china premier qiang international corporation speech cook reporter china dynamic enjoy social team weibo profile visit partner coffee business apple technology product partner share commitment innovation planet cook supplier technology shenzhen precision technology coffeemaker saturnbird coffee ground container environmental theme cook trip expansive store shanghai avoid afoul geopolitical sensitivity relation united china deteriorate threat bytedance tiktok united chinese owner divest apple china riposte navigate ban iphones chinese government business company global corporate operation neutral aim net climate impact entire business manufacturing supply chain product life cycle apple goal plastic product packaging exterior plastic wrap iphone packaging apple tonne waste impact vast manufacturing network hundred million iphones ipads china,"[(9, 0.9957365)]",9
663209,Lifestyle,5,25/03/2024,The AI conspiracy factory,"Conspiracies about monsters, asteroids, and vampires are flooding TikTok, driven by AI-generated  content.","FROM vampires and wendigos to killer asteroids, TikTok users are pumping out outlandish end-of-the-world conspiracy theories, researchers say, in yet another misinformation trend on a platform whose fate in the United States hangs in the balance.
 In the trend reported by the nonprofit Media Matters, TikTok users seek to monetise viral videos that make unfounded claims about the US government secretly capturing or preserving mythical monsters that include – wait for it – King Kong.It is the latest illustration of misinformation swirling on the platform – a stubborn issue that has been largely absent in recent policy debates as US lawmakers mull banning the Chinese-owned app on grounds of national security.
 Often accompanied by spooky background music, the videos – many of which garner millions of views – feature imperious AI-generated voices, sometimes mimicking celebrities.
 “We are all probably going to die in the next few years. Did you hear about this?” said a voice impersonating podcaster Joe Rogan in one viral video.
 “There’s this asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth,” the voice claims, citing information leaked by a government official who stumbled upon a folder titled “keep secret from the public”.
 At least one account peddling that video appeared to be deactivated after AFP reached out to TikTok for comments.
 ‘Highly engaging’
 Conspiracy theory videos, often posted by anonymous accounts, typically had the telltale signs of AI-generated images such as extra fingers and distortions, said TikTok misinformation researcher Abbie Richards.
 Peddling such theories can be  financially rewarding, Richards said, with TikTok’s “Creativity Program” designed to pay creators for content generated on the platform.
 It has spawned what she called a cottage industry of conspiracy theory videos powered by artificial intelligence tools, including text-to-speech applications that are widely – and freely – available online.
 A TikTok spokeswoman insisted that “conspiracy theories are not eligible to earn money or be recommended” in user feeds.
 “Harmful misinformation is prohibited, with our safety teams removing 95% of it proactively before it’s reported,” she said.
 Still, tutorials on platforms such as YouTube show users how to create “viral conspiracy theory videos” and profit off TikTok’s Creativity Program.
 One such tutorial openly instructed users to start by making up “something outrageous” such as “scientists just got caught hiding a sabre-toothed tiger”.
 “Financially incentivising content that is both highly engaging and cheap to manufacture creates an environment for conspiracy theories to thrive,” Richards wrote in the Media Matters report.
 Threat of AI
 Such concerns, driven by rapid advancements in AI, are particularly high in a year of major elections around the world.
 Recently, the European Union wielded its powerful Digital Services Act (DSA) to press several platforms, including TikTok, on the risks of AI – including from deepfakes – for upcoming elections in the 27-nation bloc.
 In the United States, where the app has some 170 million users – roughly half the country’s population – lawmakers overwhelmingly backed a bill recently to ban TikTok unless Chinese parent company ByteDance divested itself within six months.
 The bill, which still needs to pass the more cautious upper house of the US Congress, risks riling young voters in a key election year.
 US policymakers have repeatedly expressed concerns about TikTok’s alleged ties to the Chinese government, user data safety and its apparent impact on national security.
 According to a report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Chinese government is using TikTok to expand its global influence operations to promote pro-Beijing narratives and undermine American democracy, including through disinformation.
 “Disinformation should be part of the debate about TikTok,” said Aynne Kokas, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.
 Many experts, however, as well as young users who rely on the app as their primary source of news, oppose banning TikTok, saying it’s unfair to single out the platform.
 “There’s lots of misinformation on TikTok, just as there is on other social media platforms. Some of that misinformation is dangerous,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
 “(But) investing the government with the authority to suppress misinformation – or to ban Americans from accessing platforms that host misinformation – is not a sensible response to this problem. Nor would it be a constitutional one,” he added. – AFP",vampire killer asteroid user outlandish conspiracy theory researcher trend platform fate united hang balance trend nonprofit medium matter user viral video claim government mythical monster kong illustration misinformation platform stubborn issue absent policy lawmaker mull chinese app ground national security spooky background music video garner million view imperious voice celebrity hear voice podcaster joe rogan viral video asteroid collision earth voice claim leaked government official folder secret public account video deactivated afp tiktok comment conspiracy theory video anonymous account telltale sign image extra finger distortion misinformation researcher abbie richards theory richards tiktok creativity program pay creator platform cottage industry conspiracy theory video artificial intelligence tool text speech application tiktok spokeswoman conspiracy theory eligible earn money feed harmful misinformation safety team tutorial platform user viral conspiracy theory video profit tiktok creativity program tutorial instructed user outrageous scientist sabre tiger content cheap manufacture environment conspiracy theory richards medium matter threat concern rapid advancement major election union powerful digital service dsa press platform tiktok risk deepfakes upcoming election nation bloc app user half country population lawmaker bill ban tiktok chinese parent company bytedance month bill cautious upper house congress risk voter key election policymakers concern tie chinese government user data safety apparent impact national security report office director national intelligence chinese government tiktok expand global influence operation pro beijing narrative undermine american democracy disinformation disinformation debate tiktok aynne medium study university virginia expert user primary source news tiktok unfair single platform lot misinformation social medium platform dangerous jameel jaffer director amendment institute columbia university government authority suppress misinformation ban american platform host misinformation response constitutional afp,"[(4, 0.99626446)]",4
661551,StarBiz,5,20/03/2024,YTL AI Cloud to deploy advanced supercomputer,Data centre in Johor will speed up country’s AI adoption,"KUALA LUMPUR: YTL Power International has announced the formation of YTL AI Cloud, a specialised provider of massive-scale graphic processing unit (GPU)-based accelerated computing.
 YTL AI Cloud will deploy and manage one of the world’s most advanced supercomputers on Nvidia Grace Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud, an artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer for accelerating the development of generative AI.
 In a statement yesterday, YTL said the YTL AI Supercomputer will be located in a 664-ha data centre facility in the YTL Green Data Centre Campus in Johor, powered by a renewable energy source from its on-site 500-megawatt solar power facility.
 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said YTL AI Cloud, the first for Malaysia, will accelerate Malaysia’s adoption of AI and spearhead the development of the country’s Sovereign Cloud. 
 “The collaboration with Nvidia is a testament to Malaysia’s attractiveness as a hub for digital investments,” he said.

 “This marks a significant step forward in our mission to become a leading AI and data centre hub in the region,” he said.
 He said the initiative not only brings Malaysia closer to achieving its goals under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030, but also demonstrates Malaysia’s capability and readiness to play a significant role in the global technology landscape.
 It is to be noted that  YTL will be among the first companies to adopt Nvidia GB200 NVL72 – a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system with fifth-generation NVLink.
 The supercomputer will be interconnected by Nvidia Quantum InfiniBand networking platform.
 The platform acts as a single GPU with 1.4 exaflops of AI performance and 30 terabytes of fast memory, and is designed for the most compute-intensive workloads.
 The YTL AI Supercomputer will surpass more than 300 exaflops of AI compute, making it one of the fastest supercomputers in the world.
 “There is no doubt that AI is a critical tool that will power the global digital economy,” said Digital Minister, Gobind Singh Deo (pic).He said having one of the most powerful Nvidia cloud computing infrastructures in Malaysia is a game changer and will spark innovation and development of solutions which are instrumental to the success of the Malaysia Digital Economy blueprint.

660937,StarBiz,11,18/03/2024,Apple without AI looks more like Coca-Cola than high-growth tech,,"NEW YORK: For two decades, no company better embodied the promise of the stock market than Apple Inc. Its transformation from niche computer maker to the most valuable corporation on the planet made its shares a cornerstone of investment portfolios worldwide.
 But in what seems like a blink of an eye, Apple’s sheen is starting to fade. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the story in technology now, driving the kind of growth that the company used to count on from selling its gadgets and services to eager consumers across the globe.
 This has Apple investors in a quandary. Its revenue expansion is stagnating, and the stock is underperforming the Nasdaq 100 by about 16 percentage points, the most to start a year since 2013. 
 The company still generates massive revenues, but whether that can keep increasing at the pace investors have come to expect is an open question. Apple executives say they have big plans for AI, which bulls hope will help revive growth. But so far it’s hard to gauge its prospects.
 All of which has investors wondering, if Apple’s AI dreams don’t come to fruition, what is the role of the shares today?
 “It’s become more of a value stock, a bit like Coca-Cola,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive officer at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management and chief market strategist at Osaic. 
 “All the things you want that’s going to offer you a defensive profile and market rate returns for the foreseeable future until they have a new catalyst.”
 Apple remains the reliable money machine it’s always been. It’s certainly a shareholder-friendly cash flow juggernaut, and a safe haven with a bulletproof balance sheet. 
 “If you’re a long-term investor that really likes solid, stable growth, that’s very annuity like, with growing margins, improving profitability and a business that generates significant amounts of cash and still has lots of innovation runway, we think Apple is a great place to be,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.
 But investors looking to buy into the next big growth market have turned their attention to AI. Nvidia Corp is taking Apple’s place as the tech behemoth to own due to the seemingly insatiable demand for chips used to power large language models.  
 Valuation wipeout
 Apple has fallen more than 10% this year, erasing around US$330bil in market capitalisation, and ceding its position as the world’s most valuable company to Microsoft Corp, whose incorporation of ChatGPT into products like its Office software is starting to boost revenue growth. 
 Microsoft now has a market value of almost US$3.1 trillion versus Apple’s US$2.7 trillion. Nvidia, whose revenue and profits have soared amid an arms race for AI computing power, isn’t far behind at US$2.2 trillion.
 The problem isn’t so much that Apple has suddenly stopped growing, that’s been happening for a while – its revenue shrank in every quarter of its last fiscal year even as the stock was hitting records. 
 The trouble is the company hasn’t shown anything on AI at a time when iPhones sales are sluggish and the company is facing mounting regulatory threats.
 “We’re going through an incredible wave of innovation,” said Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities. “The market is telling you that Apple has a lot to prove here and to date it hasn’t shown much.”
 Notoriously secretive, Apple has divulged little about its plans to incorporate AI services into its products. Chief executive officer Tim Cook has promised that Apple would “break new ground” in AI this year and market professionals are anticipating big news at the company’s annual software developer’s conference in a few months. 
 However, many investors are losing patience and turning to stocks with a clearer path in AI.
 At the core of Apple’s woes is the disappearance of revenue growth and it’s unclear what, if anything, will stoke it. The company’s first major new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro headset, isn’t expected to contribute significantly to growth for years. 
 Apple recently pulled the plug on its long effort to build an electric car. At the same time iPhone revenue has stagnated and sales in China have dropped amid a weak economy and greater competition.
 Regulatory pressures
 On top of that Apple is facing mounting pressure from regulators. Earlier this month, Apple was fined about US$2bil by the European Union over an investigation into claims it blocked music-streaming rivals on its platforms.
 In the United States, the Justice Department appears close to filing an antitrust lawsuit after five years of work building a case alleging Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on iPhones and iPads to impede competition from rivals.
 Sales in fiscal 2023 fell 3% and are projected to rise just 2% in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, revenue expanded at a 33% clip in 2021. 
 Meanwhile, Nvidia’s sales are projected to jump 79% and Microsoft’s 15% in the companies’ current fiscal years. 
 For the past couple of years, Apple has commanded a premium valuation on par with Microsoft’s. Two years ago, when tech stocks got hit hard, the shares held up far better than those of its peers. But that’s no longer the case. 
 Apple is priced at about 25 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from about 30 times last summer. That’s similar to Walmart Inc‘s valuation. Microsoft, meanwhile, is priced at 32 times and Nvidia at 35 times. 
 That said, Microsoft trading at a record high may actually offer a good example of Apple’s long-term potential. When Satya Nadella took over the company in 2014 it was a software maker with a 20th century mindset and a languishing stock. Now it’s everywhere, from the cloud to AI, and its stock is soaring.
 “Everyone has to reinvent themselves, and it just shows you how quick the revolution in tech is,” Citizens JMP’s Lehmann said. “Microsoft finally got going, but it took them 15 years to figure it out.”
 Despite this year’s gloomy performance, it’s easy to make the case that Apple shares are poised for a rebound and that it’s too early to count it out of the AI race. 
 The company has more than US$170bil in cash on its balance sheet and its net income is expected to top US$100bil this year. 
 That gives Apple unmatched resources to push into new markets and still return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
 “It’s hard to not compare to what’s the hot thing right now,” Jensen Investment Management’s Walkush said. “If you took AI out of the picture right now, and the sensationalism, would people look at Apple differently? I think they would.” — Bloomberg",york decade company promise stock market apple transformation niche computer maker valuable corporation planet share investment portfolio eye apple sheen fade artificial intelligence story technology growth company count gadget service eager consumer apple investor quandary revenue expansion stock nasdaq percentage start company massive revenue pace investor question apple executive bull revive growth hard gauge prospect investor apple fruition role share stock bit coca cola phil blancato chief executive officer thalmann asset management chief market strategist osaic defensive profile market rate return foreseeable future catalyst apple reliable money machine shareholder friendly cash flow juggernaut safe bulletproof balance sheet term investor solid stable growth annuity margin profitability business generates amount cash lot apple kevin walkush portfolio manager jensen investment management investor growth market attention corp apple tech insatiable demand chip power language model valuation apple bil market capitalisation position valuable company microsoft corp incorporation chatgpt product office software boost revenue growth microsoft market versus apple nvidia revenue profit arm race power apple revenue quarter fiscal stock hitting record trouble company time iphones sale sluggish company regulatory threat incredible innovation mark lehmann chief executive officer citizen jmp security market apple lot secretive apple plan service product chief executive officer tim cook apple break ground market professional news company annual software developer conference month investor patience stock path core apple woe disappearance revenue growth unclear company major product category decade vision headset contribute growth apple plug effort electric car time iphone revenue sale china weak economy competition regulatory pressure top apple mounting pressure regulator month apple bil european union investigation claim music streaming rival platform united justice department filing antitrust lawsuit building apple software hardware limitation ipads competition rival sale rise current data bloomberg comparison revenue clip nvidia sale jump microsoft company current fiscal couple apple premium valuation par microsoft tech stock hard share peer apple time profit month time summer valuation time nvidia time microsoft trading record offer apple term potential satya nadella company software maker century mindset stock cloud stock reinvent quick revolution tech citizen lehmann microsoft figure gloomy performance easy apple share rebound count race company cash balance sheet net income top bil apple unmatched resource push market cash shareholder dividend stock buyback hard compare hot jensen investment management walkush picture sensationalism people apple bloomberg,"[(9, 0.99739206)]",9
660593,StarEdu,2,17/03/2024,An eye on AI,,"The Higher Education Ministry is looking into setting up a polytechnic for artificial intelligence (AI) in Malaysia.
 Its minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abdul Kadir said a study is being conducted on the feasibility of setting up Malaysia’s first AI polytechnic.
 “The University of Tsukuba, which is one of the leading institutes in Japan with its own AI research centre, will also be establishing a branch here.
 “As a start, the varsity will conduct its programme at Universiti Malaya this year,” he said after closing the 15th International Conference on Islamic Economics  & Finance (ICIEF) 2024 in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 22.
 In his speech, Zambry said the  education system’s curriculum  from the preschool to tertiary level is in need of urgent reform.
 TVET
 During a recent visit to Japan, Zambry said a discussion was held to understand the curriculum of the National Institute of Technology, Tokyo College (Tokyo Kosen), and to see how the ministry can upgrade technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Malaysia.
 He said there are over 50 of these institutes in Japan, and that they have produced more than 500,000 graduates in high TVET engineering.
 “One of the ministry’s main focuses is to look at the education system in providing room for students to choose their fields more effectively.
 “The stigma that TVET is a second class education must be eliminated,” he added.
 The Japanese, he said, do not look at TVET as second class education unlike how it is in Malaysia.“In Japan, at age 15, students get to decide between continuing regular schooling and attending a technical school, without needing to ponder about what field they want to venture into at the ages of 17 or 18.
 “They see high level TVET as an extremely important field of study. This is why we want to emphasise its importance.”
 Collaboration
 He also said a focus on science, mathematics and the latest technology is crucial to shape the youth into well-rounded and empowered citizens who are able to thrive in the digital economy as creators of technology rather than mere users.  
 “(But) while more focus on the latest technology is needed, we must not forget that collaboration is key. 
 “It is by fostering collaboration that young minds can learn to develop businesses and social entrepreneurship initiatives that address the critical social and environmental issues of today and tomorrow,” he said.With the increasing speed of discovery of new and modern technology, partnerships between universities, industries, civil societies and government agencies must be strengthened, he added.
 “Innovation manifests when multiple disciplines intersect. This will accelerate the pace of new discoveries and holistic solutions to challenges we face in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world.
 “Interdisciplinary collaboration is what will drive universities and colleges into incubators of change.
 “We must work together across different sectors regardless of borders to share the knowledge and resources we hold for the benefit of everyone involved.“No single entity has all the answers, and it is by bringing together academia, industries and policymakers that we are able to cultivate global citizens who are equipped to address the complexities of our time and to implement solutions that benefit the economy and the environment,” he added.
 The ministry, he said, will continuously support collaborative research, especially in niche areas such as Islamic economics that do not get sufficient attention from industries.",education ministry polytechnic artificial intelligence malaysia minister datuk seri zambry abdul kadir study feasibility malaysia polytechnic university tsukuba institute japan centre branch start varsity conduct programme universiti malaya international conference islamic economics finance icief kuala lumpur feb speech zambry education system curriculum preschool tertiary level urgent reform tvet visit japan discussion understand curriculum national institute technology tokyo college tokyo kosen ministry upgrade technical vocational education training tvet malaysia japan graduate engineering ministry main focus education system student choose field tvet class education japanese tvet class education malaysia japan age student regular technical school ponder field venture level tvet field study emphasise collaboration focus science mathematics technology crucial shape youth empowered citizen thrive digital economy creator technology mere user technology forget collaboration key collaboration mind business social entrepreneurship initiative critical social environmental issue tomorrow speed discovery modern technology partnership university industry civil society government agency innovation manifest multiple discipline accelerate pace discovery holistic solution interconnected dynamic interdisciplinary collaboration drive university incubator sector border share knowledge resource benefit single entity answer academia industry policymakers global citizen address complexity time implement solution economy environment ministry collaborative niche islamic economics sufficient attention industry,"[(4, 0.2810261), (10, 0.7143366)]",10
660221,StarExtra,8,15/03/2024,AI revolution,,"FRANCE tested Artificial Intelligence-driven video surveillance technology that will be deployed during the Olympic Games at a Depeche Mode concert last week, calling the exercise a success.
 French legislation passed in 2023 permits the use of AI video surveillance for a trial period covering the Games to detect abnormal events or human behaviour at large-scale events.
 The technology could be pivotal to thwarting an attack like the bombing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta or the Nice truck attack in 2016, officials say.
 Rights campaigners warn the technology poses a threat to civil liberties.WHAT IS AI-POWERED SURVEILLANCE?Algorithmic video surveillance uses computer software to analyse images captured by video surveillance cameras in real time.
 Four companies – Videtics, Orange Business, ChapsVision and Wintics – have developed AI software that use algorithms to analyse video streams coming from existing video surveillance systems to help identify potential threats in public spaces.
 The algorithms are trained to detect pre-determined “events” and abnormal behaviour and send alerts accordingly. Human beings then decide if the alert is real and whether to act on it.WHAT WILL THE ALGORITHMS BE LOOKING FOR?The law allows for eight different “events” to be flagged by AI surveillance software during the Games that include: crowd surges; abnormally heavy crowds; abandoned objects; presence or use of weapons; a person on the ground; a fire breaking out; contravention of rules on traffic direction.
 Within these categories, specific thresholds (number of people, type of vehicle, timing etc) can be set manually to cater for each individual event, location or threat.
 WHO WILL USE AI-POWERED SURVEILLANCE?National and local police, firefighters, public transport security agents will all have access to AI-powered surveillance.
 Software developed by Wintics and tested at the Depeche Mode concert, will be deployed in the Paris region and on public transport.
 Paris Police chief Laurent Nunez described the trial as largely a success.
 “Everything went relatively well, all the lights are green (for future use),” he said.WILL FACIAL RECOGNITION BE USED?It should not. The new law continues to ban facial recognition in most cases and French authorities have said it is a red line not to be crossed.
 Nonetheless, rights campaigners are concerned mission creep risks setting in down the line.
 “Software that enables AI-powered video surveillance can easily enable facial recognition. It’s simply a configuration choice,” said Katia Roux of Amnesty International France.
 The legal framework regulating facial recognition remained too fuzzy and technical and legal safeguards were insufficient, according to Amnesty International.
 Wintics co-founder Matthias Houllier said his software’s algorithms were not trained for facial recognition.
 “There’s no personal identification method in our algorithms,” he said. “It’s technically excluded.”
 HOW WILL PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?France’s Interior Ministry has created an evaluation committee to keep tabs on civil liberties throughout the trial period.

 Tino Bao – already pursuing a doctorate in AI – created a video of his late daughter sending his wife birthday greetings and even singing her a birthday song.
 “Mummy, happy birthday. I really miss you. I hope you will always be happy and pretty,” the AI-generated Bao Rong said in Mandarin in the video, which Tino Bao posted on Facebook in January.

659560,StarBiz,11,13/03/2024,OpenAI calls Musk’s claims incoherent  in court filing,,"SAN FRANCISCO: OpenAI lambasted Elon Musk’s allegations against it, saying in a court filing that the billionaire entrepreneur’s claims “rest on convoluted – often incoherent – factual premises”. 
 The strongly worded filing is the company’s first legal response to Musk’s February lawsuit against the company, chief executive officer Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman. 
 Musk alleged the startup had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp, its largest investor. 
 In the filing, OpenAI stressed that it did not violate its agreement with Musk because “there is no founding agreement, or any agreement at all with Musk, as the complaint itself makes clear”. 
 OpenAI also denied Musk’s claims in a memo to staff and a blog post last week.
 “The relief Musk seeks is as extraordinary as his claims are contrived,” OpenAI said in its filing in San Francisco state court. 
 “Musk requests an order compelling OpenAI to reorganise and distribute its technology in accordance with the terms of his fictitious contract.”
 OpenAI and Musk have been engaged in a well publicised battle since well before the court case. 
 Musk was an early backer of the startup and part of its founding team, before he had a falling out with the company. 
 Musk has criticised OpenAI for its commercialisation strategy and its close relationship with Microsoft. 
 In its blog post, OpenAI said that Musk had previously pushed to make the company part of Tesla Inc, his car company. 
 It also said in the filing that Musk was in favour of OpenAI operating as a for-profit company, but only if he controlled it. 
 “Seeing the remarkable technological advances OpenAI has achieved, Musk now wants that success for himself,” the company’s lawyers wrote.

657697,StarBiz,8,08/03/2024,Widening lead  in AI memory chips,SK Hynix investing US$1bil to capture demand,"SEOUL: SK Hynix Inc is ramping up its spending on advanced chip packaging, in hopes of capturing more of the burgeoning demand for a crucial component in artificial intelligence (AI) development: high-bandwidth memory (HBM).
 The Icheon-based firm is investing more than US$1bil in South Korea to expand and improve the final steps of its chip manufacture, said Lee Kang-Wook, a former Samsung Electronics Co engineer who now heads up packaging development at SK Hynix. 
 Innovation with that process is at the heart of HBM’s advantage as the most sought-after AI memory, and further advances will be key to reducing power consumption, driving performance and cementing the company’s lead in the HBM market.
 Lee specialises in advanced ways of combining and connecting semiconductors, which has grown in importance with the advent of modern AI and its digestion of vast troves of data via parallel processing chains. 
 While SK Hynix has not disclosed its capital expenditure budget for this year, the average analyst estimate puts the figure at 14 trillion won (US$10.5bil). That suggests advanced packaging, which could take up a 10th of that, is a major priority.
 “The first 50 years of the semiconductor industry has been about the front-end,” or the design and fabrication of the chips themselves, Lee said in an interview. “But the next 50 years is going to be all about the back-end,” or packaging.
 Being first to achieve the next milestone in this race can now catapult companies into industry-leading positions. 
 SK Hynix was chosen by Nvidia Corp to provide the HBM for its standard-setting AI accelerators, pushing the South Korean firm’s value up to 119 trillion won. 
 Its stock has gained nearly 120% since the start of 2023, making it South Korea’s second most valuable company and outperforming Samsung and US rival Micron Technology Inc.
 Lee, now 55 years old, helped pioneer a novel method to packaging the third generation of the technology, HBM2E, which was quickly followed by the other two major makers. 
 That innovation was central to SK Hynix winning Nvidia as a customer in late 2019.
 Stacking chips to derive greater performance has long been Lee’s passion. In 2000, he earned his PhD on 3D integration technology for micro-systems from Japan’s Tohoku University, under Mitsumasa Koyanagi, who invented stacked capacitor DRAM used in mobile phones. 
 In 2002, Lee joined as principal engineer at Samsung’s memory division, where he led the development of Through-Silicon Via (TSV)-based 3D packaging technologies. That work would later become the foundation for developing HBM. 
 HBM is a type of high-performance memory that stacks chips on top of one another and connects them with TSVs for faster and more energy-efficient data processing.
 But back in the pre-smartphone era, Samsung was making bigger bets elsewhere. And the norm was for global chipmakers to outsource to smaller Asian nations the tasks of assembling, testing and packaging chips.
 So when SK Hynix and US partner Advanced Micro Devices Inc introduced HBM to the world in 2013, they remained unchallenged for two years before Samsung developed its HBM2 in late 2015. 
 Lee joined SK Hynix three years later. They joked, with a measure of pride, that HBM stood for “Hynix’s Best Memory.”
 “SK Hynix’s management had better insights into where this industry is headed and they were well prepared,” said Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA Securities Korea. 
 “When the opportunity came their way, they grabbed it with both hands.” As for Samsung, “they were caught napping.”
 ChatGPT’s release in November 2022 was the moment Lee had been waiting for. By that time, his team had developed a new packaging method called mass reflow-molded underfill, aided by his contacts in Japan. 
 The process, which involves injecting and then hardening liquid material between layers of silicon, improved heat dissipation and production yields. 
 SK Hynix teamed up with Namics Corp in Japan for the material and a related patent, according to a person familiar with the matter. — Bloomberg",seoul hynix spending chip packaging demand crucial component artificial intelligence development bandwidth memory hbm icheon firm bil south korea expand final step chip manufacture lee wook samsung electronics head development hynix innovation process heart hbm advantage memory advance key power consumption performance company lead hbm market lee specialises semiconductor grown advent modern digestion vast trove data chain hynix capital expenditure budget average analyst estimate figure bil packaging major priority semiconductor industry front design fabrication chip interview packaging milestone race catapult company industry position hynix corp hbm standard accelerator south korean firm stock south korea valuable company samsung rival micron technology lee method generation technology hbm major maker central hynix nvidia customer chip derive performance lee passion phd integration technology micro system tohoku university mitsumasa koyanagi stacked capacitor dram mobile phone lee principal engineer samsung memory division development silicon tsv packaging technology hbm hbm type performance memory stack chip top connects faster energy efficient data pre smartphone era samsung bigger bet global chipmakers asian nation task chip hynix partner micro device hbm unchallenged samsung hbm lee hynix measure pride hbm hynix memory hynix management insight industry prepared sanjeev rana analyst clsa security opportunity hand samsung chatgpt release november moment lee time team method mass reflow contact japan process liquid material layer heat dissipation production yield hynix namics japan material patent person familiar matter bloomberg,"[(12, 0.99528486)]",12
657751,Main,14,08/03/2024,Will AI replace human writers one day?,,"OVER the weekend, I read an article written by my friend who was sharing stories of his recent trip to the United States. I was mesmerized by his elaborate descriptions of his experience, so much so that I made it a point to find out more about this beautiful country where many have realised their American dream. The US is now on my travel bucket list. 
 Not only has this friend inspired me to visit the US, but his article has also reaffirmed to me that writing is a skill, and it is perfected with practice. 
 In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant advancements in various industries and sectors, including journalism and writing (with tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot). Naturally, such advancements have raised the question on whether AI will one day replace humans.  
 So, will AI replace human writers one day?
 Let’s take this friend of mine as an example. He is an introvert who loves drawing and also has a knack for writing. From reading the article about his experience in the US, I am confident that the answer to the question is no. Producing an eloquent piece demands not just grammatical flair, but it also requires innovative and creative perspectives that will resonate with the readers. For this, you need to experience the subject matter.
 The whole experience and emotions that are drawn upon will make the article unique. I can’t reiterate enough that human creativity and the nuances of human emotions are simply indispensable in crafting high-quality content that will capture the readers’ attention.  
 So, while there are many existing and potentially new technologies out there to assist us in developing content, we humans are simply irreplaceable. You can use these technologies as a guide, but don’t do it blindly. I kid you not; AI-generated content can easily be spotted.

657365,StarBiz,14,07/03/2024,OpenAI fires back with emails in Musk lawsuit,Startup alleges failed bid to merge with Tesla,"NEW YORK: OpenAI fired back at a lawsuit filed against it by Elon Musk in a blog post on Tuesday, using the billionaire’s own emails to show he backed the company’s plans to become a for-profit business and that he insisted it raise “billions” of dollars to be relevant compared with Google.
 Musk filed the lawsuit last week against OpenAI, chief executive officer Sam Altman and president Greg Brockman, alleging the start-up had strayed from its mission to build responsible artificial intelligence (AI) and that it had become beholden to Microsoft Corp, its largest investor. 
 In the post, OpenAI said that Musk was lashing out after trying and failing to make the company part of Tesla Inc.
 “We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired – someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without him,” the company said in the post. 
 It was co-authored by several of OpenAI’s co-founders, including Altman, Brockman and Ilya Sutskever.
 The post also reproduced emails Musk had sent to people at the company, demonstrating that the billionaire had endorsed OpenAI’s fundraising efforts. 
 “This needs billions per year immediately, or forget it,” Musk wrote in one email, according to OpenAI.
 OpenAI, as a non-profit, raised less than US$45mil from Musk and more than US$90mil from other donors, according to the blog post. 
 Musk pushed the company to be far more ambitious in its fundraising, the emails showed. 
 At the outset, Altman and Brockman planned to raise US$100mil, OpenAI said, but Musk objected, saying the number should be higher.
 “We need to go with a much bigger number than US$100mil to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending. I think we should say that we are starting with a US$1bil funding commitment. This is real. I will cover whatever anyone else doesn’t provide.”
 Musk alleges in his suit that the start-up’s close relationship with Microsoft has undermined its original mission of creating open-source technology free from undue corporate influence. 
 “To this day, OpenAI Inc’s website continues to profess that its charter is to ensure that AGI ‘benefits all of humanity’,” the lawsuit said, referring to artificial general intelligence, a powerful type of AI that doesn’t yet exist. 
 “In reality, however, OpenAI Inc has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft.”
 According to the emails in the post, Musk had signed off on the idea that OpenAI wouldn’t build open-source software for artificial general intelligence and that it would not always share the science behind its technological advances. 
 “As we get closer to building AI, it will make sense to start being less open,” Sutskever wrote in a 2016 email cited by the start-up. 
 “The Open in OpenAI means that everyone should benefit from the fruits of AI after it’s built, but it’s totally okay to not share the science,” the email read. In his response, Musk replied: “Yup.”
 In the blog post, the OpenAI co-founders said that Musk hadn’t always been opposed to corporate influence at OpenAI. 
 They said that Musk had attempted to make OpenAI part of his auto company Tesla, writing in an e-mail: “Tesla is the only path that could even hope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is small. It just isn’t zero.”
 Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Musk is suing OpenAI for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and claims of unfair business practices, among other grievances. 
 He has brought the suit in the capacity of a donor to the nonprofit parent organisation as recently as 2019 and is seeking to force the San Francisco-based start-up to stop benefitting Microsoft and Altman personally.

 In a statement yesterday, Tanco said it will be seeking permission from relevant authorities to float Midports Holdings Sdn Bhd, a 79%-owned unit of Tanco, on Bursa Malaysia in due course.
 Midports, via a tie-up with the Negri Sembilan state government, will build the port – dubbed as Malaysia’s first artificial intelligence (AI) port – on Tanco’s 480-acre landbank.
 The site, located at the midway of the Straits of Malacca, features a natural deep water access with more than 21 m in depth and is capable of accommodating the largest container ships globally.
 On March 4, Midports entered into a joint venture (JV) with Menteri Besar Negri Sembilan (Pemerbadanan) (MBINS) to develop the container port.
 Following this, a JV company will be set up to undertake the construction and future operations of the port.
 The JV company will be 80% owned by Midports with the balance 20% by MBINS.
 Tanco group managing director Datuk Seri Andrew Tan Juan Suan said the AI port will offer logistical advantages.
 This will be done by significantly reducing transportation costs for gateway containers for businesses currently dependent on distant ports.
 It will also enhance speed and efficiency for transshipment containers.
 “We have started our groundwork and invited foreign industrialists to the smart AI container port location.
 “These industrialists have expressed positive feedback and interest for the potential development of new industrial park(s) in close proximity to the smart AI container port in order to establish a more conducive trade and logistic ecosystem to accelerate the state’s industrialisation plans,” he said.
 Tan further noted that the port’s proximity to industrial hubs is also expected to decrease carbon emissions, demonstrating Tanco’s contribution to sustainable practices.",jaya tanco holding plan undertake infrastructure subsidiary building smart container port port dickson statement yesterday permission relevant authority midports holding unit tanco bursa malaysia midports negri sembilan government port malaysia artificial intelligence port tanco acre site strait natural deep water access depth capable largest container ship midports joint venture menteri besar negri sembilan mbins container port company undertake construction future operation company midports balance mbins director datuk seri tan juan suan port offer logistical advantage transportation cost container business dependent distant port efficiency transshipment container groundwork foreign industrialist container port location industrialist positive feedback potential development industrial park close proximity smart container port conducive trade logistic ecosystem accelerate industrialisation plan port proximity industrial hub decrease carbon emission tanco contribution sustainable practice,"[(3, 0.9922202)]",3

 That stock belongs to Tesla Inc, which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles (EVs) were going to take over the world.
 Back then, Elon Musk’s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co in market capitalisation to become America’s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it “the next Apple Inc”.
 Now, Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their 2021 peak, and other EV stocks that raced higher with it are shadows of their former selves.
 All of which should be sobering for Nvidia investors who see the stock as a limitless bet on an artificial intelligence future. The firm’s shares have added 66% this year after more than tripling in 2023.
 There are plenty of differences between Nvidia and Tesla, from the products they make to the personalities of the men that run the companies. But the parallels are striking.
 Nvidia’s rise from a niche chipmaker to one of the biggest companies in the world is based on the premise that its phenomenal sales growth over the past year has staying power.
 Tesla’s big breakout rally, which occurred in 2020 and put its valuation well over US$1.2 trillion, was pinned on the assumption that EVs would be adopted widely and quickly and that it would be the company to dominate that market.
 But reality has interrupted that story. Demand for EVs is slowing as a wave of enthusiastic first adopters have already bought them, and more price-conscious, change-averse consumers are taking longer than expected to convert to a new technology.
 As a result, Tesla is down 31% from its recent high in July and is one of the biggest percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year.
 “There’s all this potential about the driverless car, the cybertruck and the stock is getting hit. Why? They are losing market share and they are losing margins. In the tech world that is the kiss of death,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital.
 For Nvidia, it’s too early in the hype cycle for any signs of a slowdown. The Santa Clara, California-based company has delivered blow-out results for four consecutive quarters, fuelled by what appears to be insatiable demand for its chips used to train large language models that power AI applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
 After more than tripling last year, the stock in 2024 is again the best performer in the S&P 500 Index, with a 66% advance.
 Nvidia’s market value of more than US$2 trillion trails only two American companies: Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp.
 The talk of broad-based use of AI across industries and businesses brings to mind the excitement around the Internet and the years leading into the dot-com bubble.
 But unlike that era, when Internet companies were valued on new metrics like “clicks” while bleeding cash, Nvidia is pumping out massive profits.
 Net income jumped more than 500% to nearly US$30bil last year and is projected to double in the current year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Those big profits and sales, along with the company’s ability to continually beat estimates, have helped keep a lid on valuation metrics.
 Still, Nvidia has the highest price-to-sales ratio in the S&P 500, at 18.
 Currently, the semiconductor manufacturer has a sizable lead in the types of graphics chips that excel at crunching large amounts of data used in AI models.
 But its competitors are eager to grab a piece of that market. Advanced Micro Devices Inc recently released a line of accelerators, and even Nvidia’s customers like Microsoft Corp are racing to develop chips.
 “If you really believe in this AI frenzy, you can visualise a future 10 years from now where AI is embedded in a lot of places, and you need these massive systems running chips that can only be delivered by Nvidia,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital.
 “Even if there’s a perception of a pause in buying, the stock will get hit.”
 None of this is meant to dismiss the disruptive power of electric cars or AI. But it does raise the question of whether investors are paying for future growth that may never arrive. — Bloomberg",york nvidia rise stock market high cautionary reminder investor dream technological transformation tumble earth disappointment stock belongs tesla mania investor electric vehicle elon musk company phenomenon carmaker motor motor market capitalisation america biggest auto manufacturer analyst industry apple tesla share stock shadow nvidia investor stock limitless artificial intelligence future firm share plenty difference tesla product personality company parallel nvidia rise niche chipmaker biggest company premise phenomenal sale growth power tesla rally valuation assumption ev company market reality story demand enthusiastic adopter price conscious change averse consumer convert technology result tesla july biggest percentage decliners potential driverless car cybertruck stock market share margin tech kiss death sameer bhasin principal capital nvidia hype cycle sign slowdown santa clara california company blow consecutive quarter insatiable demand chip language model power application chatgpt stock performer advance nvidia market trail american company apple microsoft corp talk broad industry business brings excitement internet dot bubble era internet company metric click cash nvidia massive profit net income double current data bloomberg profit sale company ability beat estimate lid valuation metric nvidia price sale semiconductor manufacturer sizable lead type graphic chip amount data model competitor eager grab piece market micro device accelerator customer corp racing chip frenzy visualise future lot massive system chip sameer bhasin principal capital perception stock meant dismiss disruptive power electric car question investor future growth arrive bloomberg,"[(9, 0.99565756)]",9
656188,StarMetro,7,04/03/2024,AI initiative for local schools,Association plans to revolutionise teaching using new technology,"PENANG will have an Artificial Intelligence for Schools programme (AI4S), specifically for talent development in the near future.
 The programme under the “Penang 5G Digital Library” initiative by Persatuan Kebajikan 88 Kapten Pulau Pinang (88 Captains) would be able to revolutionise teaching through the use of AI-powered tools and methods, according to the plan.
 88 Captains chairman Datuk Seri Dr Ooi Eng Hock said with AI4S, teachers and educators could personalise learning, improve students’ outcomes and better prepare children in the digital age.
 “AI should supplement their efforts, not be a substitute for them.
 “In addition, to resonate with the recent launch of AI for Rakyat by the Prime Minister, 88 Captains would like to kick off a new programme called AI for Schools to provide infrastructure and guidance by professionals for schools as an extension of our 5G School Digital Library programme,” he said in his speech at the 88 Captains Chinese New Year lunch.
 Ooi said 88 Captains was on the verge of achieving its target to implement the Penang 5G School Digital Library programme in 88 schools in Penang.
 The programme had been implemented in 72 schools  in the state, Ooi said.
 He added that the association received an overwhelming response from the schools, based on the request from Deputy Chief Minister II Jagdeep Singh Deo who wanted 88 Captains to consider expanding the programme beyond 88 schools.
 “We will also support the construction of new schools in Penang, namely SJK (C) Kwang  Aik, SJK (T) Ladang Juru and the building of  ViTrox College,” he said.
 During the lunch event, 16 donors presented mock cheques  of RM150,000 each to the 88 Captains Education Fund (2024-2025), totalling RM2.4mil.
 Also present were Penang governor Tun Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak and his consort Toh Puan Khadijah Mohd Nor, Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Dr Mohamad Abdul Hamid, several state executive councillors and state assemblymen among other dignitaries.
 Chow, in his speech, praised 88 Captains for their efforts in helping improve talent development among youths in Penang.
 He said he could remember that the 88 Captains was established on April 7, 2022, and since then, it has been growing from strength to strength with a mere 58 members.
 “In almost two years, I would say that you have experienced remarkable growth and attained many achievements that are beneficial to Penang and especially to our next generation,” he said.
 Chow added that in November last year, he was at the same location to witness the inaugural scholarship distribution ceremony by 88 Captains with a total allocation of RM500,000.
 He said 10 of the brightest minds from Universiti Sains Malaysia, UOW KDU Penang University College, Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management & Technology and AIMST University were the recipients and beneficiaries of the scholarship.
 He described it as not only an investment of some of Penang’s brightest minds but was optimistic that the money was well spent to secure the future of the younger generation.
 He also acknowledged private entities, that were part of the programme, for providing equipment and expertise to realise the Penang 5G School Digital Library programme.

656204,Lifestyle,5,04/03/2024,Tackling everyday  problems with  AI,"As Singapore shuns heavy regulation and works with Big Tech to build AI tools, some say it could become too reliant on tech firms.","BOOKING a badminton court at one of Singapore’s 100-odd community centres can be a workout in itself, with residents forced to type in times and ­venues repeatedly on a website until they find a free slot. Thanks to AI (artificial intelligence), it could soon be easier.
 The People’s Association, which runs the community centres, worked with a government tech agency to build a chatbot powered by generative artificial intelligence to help residents find free courts in the city-state’s four official languages.
 The booking chatbot, which could be rolled out shortly, is among more than 100 generative AI-based solutions spurred by the AI Trailblazers project, launched last year to find AI-based solutions to everyday problems.
 The project, backed by Singapore government agencies and Google, has also led to the development of tools to scan job applicants’ CVs, develop ­customised teaching curriculums, and generate transcripts of customer service calls.
 It is part of the South-East Asian nation’s AI strategy that is light on regulation and keen on “AI for all”, said Josephine Teo, minister for communications and information.
 “Regulations are certainly part of good governance, but in AI, we have to make sure there is good infrastructure to ­support the activities,” she said at a briefing last month at Google’s Singapore office where some of the new tools were demonstrated.
 “Another very important aspect is building capabilities ...(and) making sure that people not only have access to the tools, but are provided with opportunities to grow the skills that will enable them to use these tools well,” Teo said.
 With an explosion in the use of generative AI globally, governments are racing to curb its harms – from election disinformation to deepfakes – without throttling innovation or the potential economic benefits.
 In Singapore, the focus is on AI adoption in the public sector and industry, and building an enabling environment of research, skills and collaboration, said Denise Wong, an assistant chief executive at Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which ­oversees the country’s digital strategy.
 “We are not looking at regulation – we see a trusted ecosystem as critical for the public to use AI confidently,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 “So we need an ecosystem where companies are comfortable, that allows for innovation and to deploy in a way that is safe and responsible, which in turn brings trust,” she said.
  Responsible AIWith its stable business ­environment, Singapore ­consistently ranks near the top of the global innovation index, climbing to fifth place last year on the strength of its institutions, human capital and infrastructure.
 On AI, Singapore was an early adopter, releasing its first national AI strategy in 2019 with the aim of individuals, businesses, and communities using AI “with confidence, ­discernment, and trust”.
 It began testing generative AI tools in its courts last year, and uses them in schools and in government agencies, and released its second national strategy in December, with the mission “AI for the public good, for Singapore and the world”.
 Also last year, Singapore set up the AI Verify Foundation to develop testing tools for responsible use, and a generative AI sandbox for trialing products. IMDA, along with technology companies IBM, Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, are among its primary members.
 The toolkit, on code-sharing platform GitHub, has drawn the interest of dozens of local and global companies, Wong said.
 “It provides users the means to test on parameters they care about, like gender representation or cultural representation, and nudges them toward the desired outcome,” she added.
 In tests by tech firm Huawei, the toolkit highlighted racial bias in the data, while tests by UBS bank prompted reminders that certain attributes in the data could affect the model’s fairness, according to IMDA.
 “We want to enable everyone to use AI responsibly. But governments cannot do this on their own,” Wong said.
  Goldilocks modelWorldwide, there are more than 1,600 AI policies and strategies from 169 countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
 The United States has opted for a ­market-based model with minimal regulation, while Europe has embraced a rights-based approach, and China has prioritised sovereignty and security, said Simon Chesterman, a senior director at AI Singapore, the lead government programme.
 Singapore has taken a different path.
 “For small jurisdictions like Singapore, the challenge is how to avoid under-regulating – meaning you expose your ­citizens to risk – or over-­regulating, meaning you might drive innovation elsewhere and miss out on the opportunities,” he said.
 “In addition to this Goldilocks idea of regulation, there is a real willingness to partner with industry ... because industry standards and choices will always be the first line of defence against problems ­associated with AI,” he said.
 “It also increases the chances that Singapore can reap the benefits of the new knowledge economy.”
 The 10-member Association of South-East Asian Nations’ guide to AI governance and ethics, released this month, recommends principles of transparency, fairness and equity, accountability and integrity, and “human-­centricity”.
 Yet member countries including Singapore, Cambodia and Myanmar have been criticised for using AI to enhance surveillance, including with facial recognition and crowd analytics systems, and patrol robots.
 A second edition of the AI Trailblazers project will be launched in Singapore this year, and help up to 150 more organisations build generative AI solutions for everyday ­challenges, Teo said.
 While these collaborations between the government, industry and academia can accelerate technological ­progress, there are risks, warned Ausma Bernot, a researcher at Griffith University in Australia.
 “There is the possibility of becoming overly reliant on these corporations in the medium- to long-term,” she said.
 “The challenge is striking a balance between cooperation and maintaining sovereign ­control over critical AI infrastructure.”
 At the Trailblazers event, a short film on the People’s Association’s booking chatbot created a buzz of excitement.
 There were more than 140,000 badminton court bookings in 2022, so a tool that can help do it easily is welcome, said Weng Wanyi, director of the National AI Office.
 “It will save time and effort,” she said. “At the end of the day, it’s about solving real problems with technology.” – Thomson Reuters Foundation",badminton court odd community centre resident type time venue free slot artificial intelligence easier people community centre government tech agency chatbot generative artificial intelligence resident free court city official chatbot generative solution trailblazer solution project singapore government agency development tool scan job applicant customised teaching curriculum transcript customer service south east asian nation strategy light regulation keen josephine teo minister communication regulation governance infrastructure support activity month google singapore office tool aspect building capability people access tool opportunity skill enable tool teo explosion generative government curb harm election disinformation innovation potential economic benefit adoption public sector industry environment skill collaboration denise wong assistant chief executive infocomm medium development authority oversees country digital strategy regulation ecosystem critical public thomson reuters ecosystem company comfortable innovation deploy safe responsible brings trust responsible aiwith stable business environment top global innovation strength institution human capital infrastructure adopter national strategy aim individual business community confidence discernment trust generative tool court school government agency national strategy mission public singapore singapore verify foundation testing tool responsible generative sandbox trialing product imda technology company microsoft google salesforce primary toolkit code platform github drawn local global company user parameter gender representation cultural representation nudge outcome test firm huawei toolkit racial bias data test ubs bank reminder data affect model fairness imda enable government wong goldilocks policy strategy country economic operation development oecd opted market model minimal regulation europe right approach china sovereignty security simon chesterman senior director singapore lead government programme path jurisdiction challenge avoid expose citizen risk drive innovation opportunity addition goldilocks idea regulation real willingness partner industry industry standard choice defence increase chance reap benefit economy association east asian nation governance ethic month principle transparency fairness equity accountability integrity human centricity country singapore cambodia myanmar enhance surveillance facial recognition crowd analytics system robot edition trailblazer singapore organisation generative solution everyday challenge collaboration government industry academia accelerate technological progress risk bernot researcher griffith university possibility reliant corporation term challenge balance cooperation sovereign control critical infrastructure trailblazer event short film people chatbot buzz excitement badminton court booking weng wanyi director national office save time effort day real technology thomson reuters,"[(8, 0.40129474), (10, 0.17717046), (13, 0.41919366)]",13
655615,StarBiz 7,6,02/03/2024,Nvidia: The mother of  all artificial intelligence,,"NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), one of the greatest stock market finds in recent times continues to defy the odds, with not only mind-blowing share price performance but one that is backed by fundamentals.
 The company is a leader in high-end graphic processing units (GPUs) semiconductor chips with a staggering 75% global market share. These chips enable artificial intelligence (AI) applications as well as machine learning capabilities, which is today’s buzzword in the technology industry. 
 But it is not that NVDA was born yesterday that it has now reached the pinnacle of success but the company itself has been around for more than three decades. 
 Founded by three computer scientists including its current owner, Jensen Huang, in 1993, the company went public in 1999 and focused on graphic-based computing and video games. 
 NVDA’s biggest breakthrough was just a couple of years ago when ChatGPT’s generative AI chatbot was released to the public, which is powered by 10,000 NVDA GPUs. 
 Not only that, but these GPUs are also an important part of data centres, a business that is now a dominant part of NVDA’s success. 
 A blowout quarter
 For the recently released fourth-quarter (4Q) 2023, NVDA reported a staggering 263% growth in revenue to US$22.1bil, well ahead of the market forecast, while earnings per share leap-frogged almost five-fold to US$5.16, marginally ahead of the street forecast. 
 Data centre revenue alone accounted for more than 80% of the quarterly revenue as revenue surged 409% to US$18.4bil! Another interesting take from its quarterly announcement is how dominant NVDA is in the business as gross margins hit 76.7% in the quarter. 
 According to NVDA’s website, the company’s business model is now being fuelled by multiple demand drivers and this includes demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialised ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer Internet companies, vertical industries, led by automotive, financial services, and healthcare sectors. 
 One of NVDA’s products, the NVIDIA RTX, which was introduced less than six years ago, is now a massive PC platform for generative AI, enjoyed by more than 100 million gamers and creators. 
 Sustainable – for now
 Post-4Q23 earnings, NVDA guided an even stronger 1Q24 with revenue at US$24bil – almost 10% above the consensus estimate while gross margins are expected to be maintained at the 77% range. 
 The question on investors’ minds is of course whether NVDA can continue to grow exponentially and at the same time maintain its sky-high margins. 
 NVDA has clearly demonstrated an incredible growth trajectory. Given the undeniable potential and necessity of AI across various industries, and considering NVDA’s leading position in the market, its unique competitive advantages and partnerships, and its technological prowess, it’s reasonable to assume that the company will continue to experience robust growth.
 An AI bubble?
 NVDA, which has rallied almost 57% this year alone, and more than five-bagger since the start of 2023, has reached an unprecedented valuation with a total market capitalisation of close to US$2 trillion, which is even larger than Russia’s annual gross domestic product. 
 It is now the world’s fourth most valuable company after Microsoft, Apple, and Saudi Aramco, and ahead of other larger tech names like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. 
 Post-4Q earnings, NVDA added US$272bil in market capitalisation alone – making it the single largest one-day value gain ever. 
 Trading at a trailing forward 12-month price-earnings ratio of about 37 times, NVDA is no longer a cheap stock relative to earnings growth but most analysts have maintained a “strong buy” call with a 12-month forward price target of about US$850 – approximately 8% upside from its current price. 
 NVDA is not alone in the business that it is in and there are other market players which include companies like Intel and AMD, while hyperscalers, including cloud service providers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, are also developing and using application-specific integrated circuits, build for their own specific AI needs. 
 With the world moving towards innovation and technology-driven solutions, the market capitalisation of these companies has simply gone exponential. 
 However, as more companies enter the market providing solutions similar to or in competition with NVDA, mainly due to the super-normal profits that the company is presently enjoying, NVDA’s future profit growth will slow and margins can only trend lower. 
 Super margins don’t last
 Making more than 75 US cents to the US dollar is insane for any business and bound to attract competition. The competition may take time to establish itself but sooner or later this will eat into the incumbent’s huge market share. 
 Take Tesla for example, which can be said to have revolutionised the automotive sector with its electric car offering but competition coming from other automotive companies, especially those from China, has seen Tesla reducing its selling prices and its margins have dropped from a high of almost 30% to less than 18% in the latest quarter. 
 Locally, the pandemic too had taught us a lesson as the surge in demand for rubber gloves drove prices to the roof, and companies in the sector saw gross margins surge from below 20% to as high as 70%-80% but turned negative in recent quarters due to lower average selling price and subdued demand. 
 In both of the above examples, the share price of Tesla today is half of what it was at the peak, and in our local example, the share price of our glove companies has more or less collapsed by as much as 90%. 
 Given the above scenario, while NVDA is now the darling stock of the US stock market and perhaps to a larger extent having a spillover effect on other stocks, the end is near for the share price to peak and when the first evidence of lower gross profit margin and slowing topline growth kicks in, investors will be in for a rough downhill ride.

655642,StarBiz 7,12,02/03/2024,Wall Street hunts for more AI gold post-Nvidia rally,,"MONEY managers are scrambling to cash in on the stock market’s interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as a stunning rally by Nvidia sparks a search for other companies that are capitalising on the technology.
 Shares of Nvidia – whose chips are the gold standard in the AI industry – are up about 60% this year after tripling in 2023. 
 The run has pushed its market value to roughly US$2 trillion, making it the third-largest US company by market cap after Microsoft and Apple.
 It has also spurred Wall Street to search for other AI-focused companies in hopes of catching outsized moves.
 Whether investors are looking at the broader chip industry or betting on firms elsewhere in the value chain, they agree on one thing: AI is here to stay.
 “It’s not a fad,” said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager for F/m Investments’ Large Cap Focused Fund.
 “There are too many cases where companies can make really good use of the technology to enhance both their top and bottom lines.”
 Excitement over AI helped power the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record high on Thursday, while the S&P 500 also marked its latest record. The indexes are both up about 7% this year.
 Further signs of the growing fixation on AI have been easy to spot. Mentions of AI on conference calls reached a new high in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs said recently. The bank’s analysts have estimated AI technology could add 1.5 percentage points to US productivity growth if there is widespread adoption over the next decade.
 A Morgan Stanley survey of chief information officers suggests 2024 is “a Year of Investment for AI,” the bank said in a note this week, with CIOs naming AI/machine learning as their top priority for the first time.
 Bido’s fund retains a large holding in Nvidia, but has branched out into other AI plays, including rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices and MongoDB, whose database products could be in high demand as AI is poised to change data infrastructure needs. — Reuters",money manager cash stock market artificial intelligence rally search company technology share chip standard industry pushed market largest company market cap microsoft apple wall street search company move investor chip industry betting firm chain stay francisco bido senior portfolio manager investment fund company technology top bottom line excitement power composite record thursday record index sign fixation easy spot mention conference call fourth quarter goldman bank analyst technology add percentage productivity growth widespread adoption decade morgan survey chief officer investment bank note week cio machine top priority time bido fund play rival chipmaker micro device database product change data infrastructure reuters,"[(2, 0.99006915)]",2
655142,StarBiz,10,01/03/2024,Alibaba unveils big cloud price cuts on AI rivalry,,"Beijing: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is rolling out its second major cost cuts for cloud services in years, aiming to win back users from rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd competing to provide the tools critical to training artificial intelligence (AI).
 The Chinese internet pioneer slashed prices starting yesterday on scores of internet-based products and services by as much as 55%, and by 20% on average. 
 The discounts span more than 100 product specifications, including data storage and elastic computing products that provide online processing power to clients, Alibaba executives said during a briefing.
 The cuts mark one of the more aggressive moves by Alibaba to regain leadership from Tencent and Baidu Inc in the cloud business, which is essential in the development of generative AI. 
 The price cuts come after Alibaba called off a spin-off and initial public offering for the formerly fast-growing unit.
 It’s now focusing on growing the public cloud – the domestic services arm aimed at enterprise customers – given US sanctions curtailing the supply of advanced chips to Chinese firms. Chief executive officer Eddie Wu has taken direct control of the unit and revamped major lines.
 Alibaba has struggled over the past year to revamp its vast eCommerce, logistics and cloud empire in the face of fierce competition and geopolitical risks. 
 The company announced cuts from 15%-50% for core products of the Alibaba Cloud in April last year, in a move aimed at capitalising on the demand for raw computing power needed for AI models such as Alibaba’s own Tongyi Qianwen.
 “We see tremendous growth prospects of China’s digital market,” Liu Weiguang, president of the unit’s public cloud segment, said in the statement. 
 “That’s why we decided to launch the price reduction campaign to lower the threshold of cloud services for more enterprises and developers to reap the technological dividends and accelerate the adoption of advanced public cloud services across various industries in China.” — Bloomberg",major cost cut service win user tencent holding provide tool critical training artificial intelligence chinese internet pioneer price yesterday score product service average discount span product specification data storage elastic computing product online processing power client executive cut aggressive move leadership tencent baidu cloud business essential development generative price cut alibaba spin initial public offering unit public cloud domestic service arm enterprise customer sanction supply advanced chip chinese firm chief executive officer direct control unit major line revamp vast ecommerce logistics empire fierce competition geopolitical risk company cut core product cloud april move demand raw power model tongyi tremendous growth prospect digital market liu president unit public cloud segment statement launch price reduction campaign threshold cloud service developer technological dividend accelerate adoption public cloud service industry bloomberg,"[(1, 0.273628), (13, 0.7190854)]",13
654760,Lifestyle,14,29/02/2024,Evaluating a dog’s personality with AI,,"ASSISTANCE dogs can be trained to accompany people with visual, hearing, motor or psychological impairments or disabilities. But some dogs are more suited to this task than others. American and British researchers have created an innovative tool to help trainers spot them.
 Scientists at the University of East London and the University of Pennsylvania have developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that evaluates a dog’s personality. The tool is based on data from almost 8,000 Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaires (C-BARQ). 
 For over 20 years, this test has been a benchmark in the evaluation of potential working dogs.
 But some of the 100 questions that make up the C-BARQ are subjective, which can bias the results of the questionnaire. 
 Artificial intelligence can remedy this problem by “adjust(ing) for outlying responses”, as James Serpell, a professor of ethics and animal welfare emeritus at the UPenn School of Veterinary Medicine, explains in a news release.
 The algorithm devised by Professor Serpell and colleagues groups the C-BARQ results into five main categories: “Excitable/attached”, “anxious/fearful”, “aloof/predatory”, “reactive/assertive” and “calm/agreeable”. These categories give an idea of a pooch’s personality and, therefore, of its professional potential.
 After all, assistance dogs need to be able to perform different actions and adapt to any environment to help their owners on a daily basis. They need to be patient and have good stress management skills. 
 This is why trainers prefer calm dogs who are docile by nature. Generally speaking, a dog with a strong character will be much harder to train.
 The researchers are convinced of the potential of their canine personality test algorithm, although they consider that more research is required. 
 “The novel AI-based methodology in this research may be    useful in the future to enhance the selection and training of dogs for specific working and non- working roles,” the scientists write in a paper, published in the journal Nature.
 Indeed, while this AI software has been designed to facilitate the selection of future assistance dogs, it could also be used in shelters to reduce the likelihood of adoptive families reconsidering their choice because they don’t get on with their new canine companion. – AFP Relaxnews",assistance dog accompany people visual motor psychological impairment disability dog task american british researcher innovative tool trainer scientist university london university pennsylvania artificial intelligence algorithm dog personality tool data canine behavior assessment barq test benchmark evaluation potential dog question subjective bias artificial intelligence remedy response james ethic animal welfare emeritus upenn school veterinary medicine news release algorithm professor serpell colleague main category excitable anxious fearful aloof predatory reactive assertive calm agreeable category idea personality professional potential assistance dog action environment owner daily basis patient stress management trainer calm dog docile nature dog strong character harder train researcher potential canine personality test algorithm methodology future enhance selection dog specific role scientist paper journal nature software facilitate selection future assistance dog shelter likelihood adoptive family choice canine companion afp relaxnews,"[(11, 0.9921528)]",11

 Even some insurance professionals may be apprehensive as they believe AI and automation may be a threat to their livelihood. 
 Visions of robots developing human personalities and taking over the world, have bled from the world of science fiction into our daily reality, colouring our perception of AI and the value it can bring to our everyday life.

 “We started to explore the use of AI to focus on the easing of processes, with the ultimate goal of creating a more seamless and convenient experience for our customers and Life Planners,” adds AIA Malaysia chief agency distribution officer Leong Chee Soong.
 Noting that the company has focused heavily on digitisation in the past four years, Ng says the company has relied heavily on data insights and analytics to increase efficiencies. 
 “We have invested a lot of time, effort and funds into technology and data analytics as technology allows us to have efficient, meaningful and personalised engagements with our customers and Life Planners,” says Ng. 
 Leong concurs, saying that the insurer utilises AI to ultimately streamline operations, and build a higher quality team of Life Planners who embrace their role as professional health and wealth advisors to customers.  
 “This in turn translates into higher trust from our customers – who are the centre of everything we do. After over 75 years of doing business in Malaysia, AIA wants to enable people to be the best versions of themselves, supported by our wide range of Total Health and Wealth Solutions and various services.”
 Revolutionising agency recruitment with AI Virtual interviews are incredibly convenient and timesaving for both hiring managers and candidates. But imagine, virtual interviews conducted by AI? It gives new meaning to the phrase: anytime and anywhere. 
 AIA Malaysia’s newly launched platform, AI Recruiter, features an AI Interview function which allows AIA to interview candidates to join its agency force in a convenient and efficient manner - using AI to schedule interviews which can take place virtually at any time of the day.
 The interview, fully conducted by AI, will then assess the responses and recommend the next course of action for AIA to take.
 It helps the insurer attract a wider talent pool, screen and filter a large number of candidates in a short duration of time, as well as reduce the hassle of scheduling.
 As for the potential candidates? They get to control where and when the interview takes place – giving them time to prepare, familiarise themselves and be comfortable before the interview.  
 AIA is the first insurer in Malaysia to introduce AI into its agency recruitment process which was developed to complement the company’s recruitment programme, AIA Elite Academy. 
 With the development of the AI Interview feature, AIA is now able to consume big data and analyse large datasets to make informed and real time recommendations to agency leaders in terms of their candidate’s likelihood of success in AIA’s Elite Academy programmes.
 AIA Elite Academy was launched in 2018 as an exclusive and first-of-its kind recruitment programme geared at developing a new generation of high performing Life Planners.
 The programme prides itself on a time-proven syllabus that features best-in-class training, and the necessary tools and skill sets that empowers AIA Life Planners to grow professionally and be successful entrepreneurs.  
 Leong shares that the AI system looks beyond the candidate’s background in terms of demographics, education, experience, and analyses their motivation level, adaptability to different environments, networking ability as well as a host of competencies and soft skills that can boost chances to succeed in this industry. 
 “The AI Interview eliminates unconscious human biases that may be present in any face-to-face interviews in any recruitment setting. This helps our agency leaders (recruiters) assess candidates in a neutral, impartial and a more holistic way prior to joining the company.
 “However, we do not take the AI’s decision as the final say. We will still assess and review their recommendation as the final decision lies with us,” says Leong.
 He adds that the entire process is simple and straightforward to navigate. The candidate begins by selecting either English, Bahasa Malaysia or Mandarin to begin the process. They would then have to answer a series of questions that will vary according to their work experience. Candidates are allowed to practise and review their answers before submitting. 
 It takes at most one day for candidates to complete the interview as opposed to the previous average turnaround time of eight days. Furthermore, agency leaders can view the interview results within an hour after the interview is completed.
 “While the implementation of AI Interview is still in its early days, we found that Elite Pro Life Planners (the highest segment of AIA Elite Academy recruits) who have gone through the AI Recruiter platform were 1.5 times more productive than those who went through traditional face-to-face interviews – demonstrating positive results even in its initial stages,” says Leong.
 He adds that AIA Malaysia has noticed a hike in quality hires and operations efficiency since launching its AI-based recruitment process in August last year.
 Meet Aisya and Alexis
 The increased awareness on how conversational chatbots have revolutionised and boosted customer service led AIA Malaysia to rollout another AI feature – AI Talk Bots dubbed ALEXIS for its conventional business and AISYA for its takaful - as part of its efforts to improve customers’ digital experiences.
 But AIA Malaysia isn’t merely implementing the AI feature for its own convenience. The insurer is actually ensuring that customers have positive experiences, while making sure their insurance coverage remains uninterrupted. The AI Talk Bot will contact customers with gentle reminders that their policy is due for payment.
 “AI Talk Bots have significantly expanded AIA’s customer outreach, enabling over 3,000 calls per day collectively. In 2022, AIA’s Customer Contact team achieved 12% of their attempted outreach to customers for policy payment reminders.
 In comparison, since the launch of the AI Talk Bots, the attempted customer reach has increased by three folds in just four months,” shares Ng.
 Capable of more than just a recorded message, the AI Talk Bots offer a personalised experience for each customer, holding all the relevant account information for them during the call to respond to their queries when asked in real-time. 
 “79% of AIA customers have completed their payments within 24 hours after receiving a call since the deployment of AI Talk Bots,” adds Ng. 
 “The algorithm of our database enables the system to provide customers with prompt, consistent and timely human-like conversations, contributing to an overall improved experience. 
 In the near future, we are looking at expanding the AI Talk Bot’s functionality for more complex customer-related reminders and interactions like inactive policies reminders and welcome calls,” says Ng.
 Identifying customer triggers
 As the main feature in AIA’s Life Planner App (ALPA) one-stop platform, Leong notes that the AI-powered Customer360° empowers Life Planners to have a complete view of their customers and even identifies significant event triggers across a customer’s life stages. 
 This allows them to easily identify and prioritise customers who may require additional protection coverage and initiate timely conversations. “Since Customer360°’s launch, over one (1) million customers have been tagged by the AI models in ALPA.
 “This has led to an increase in existing customers opting to repurchase an insurance or takaful plan from AIA – after being approached by their Life Planners,” Ng points out.
 Leong notes that this feat can only be achieved through meaningful engagements and a deeper understanding which then enables the Life Planners to customise and carefully craft needs-based solutions for their customers.
 “Our Life Planners need not carry a single piece of paper to keep track of their customers’ needs - in line with our environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts as well.”
 He explains that Customer360° gives AIA Life Planners indicators derived from its in-house propensity model to help them address specific event triggers in a customer’s life cycle, which helps Life Planners be more efficient and targeted in their outreach. 
 “If a customer welcomes a new baby and is thinking of possible protection plans for their new addition, our Life Planner will be able to pre-empt this need and provide carefully selected plans for the customer’s consideration.
 “This eliminates all the unnecessary back and forth and fosters more needs-based conversations,” adds Leong.

654076,StarBiz,9,27/02/2024,AI explodes data centre energy use,Experts say a Google-created technique may help,"NEW YORK: Tech giants are racing to ward off a carbon time bomb caused by the massive data centres they’re building around the world.
 A technique pioneered by Google is gaining currency as more power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) comes online: Using software to hunt for clean electricity in parts of the world with excess sun and wind on the grid, then ramping up data centre operations there.
 Doing so could cut carbon and costs.
 There’s an urgent need to figure out how to run data centres in ways that maximise renewable energy usage, said Chris Noble, co-founder and chief executive officer of Cirrus Nexus, a cloud-computing manager tapping data centres owned by Google, Microsoft and Amazon.
 The climate risks sparked by AI-driven computing are far-reaching – and will worsen without a big shift from fossil fuel-based electricity to clean power. 
 Nvidia Corp chief executive officer Jensen Huang has said AI has hit a “tipping point.” He has also said that the cost of data centres will double within five years to power the rise of new software.
 Already, data centres and transmission networks each account for up to 1.5% of global consumption, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
 Together, they’re responsible for emitting about as much carbon dioxide as Brazil annually.
 Hyperscalers – as the biggest  data centre  owners like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are known – have all set climate goals and are facing internal and external pressure to deliver on them.
 Those lofty targets include decarbonising their operations. 
 But the rise of AI is already wreaking havoc on those goals. 
 Graphics processing units have been key to the rise of large language models and use more electricity than central processing units used in other forms of computing.
 Training an AI model uses more power than 100 households in a year, according to IEA estimates. 
 “The growth in AI is far outstripping the ability to produce clean power for it,” he said.
 Moreover, AI’s energy consumption is volatile and more akin to a sawtooth graph than a smooth line that most data centre  operators are used to. That makes decarbonisation a challenge, to say nothing of ensuring grid stability. 
 AI’s growth is being driven by North American companies, keeping computing power – and energy usage – concentrated there, said Dave Sterlace, account director for global data centres at Hitachi Energy. 
 That’s a trend he didn’t expect two years ago. 
 Load shifting
 To lower data centre CO2 emissions, hyperscalers and other  data centre  providers have financed massive amounts of solar or wind farms and used credits to offset emissions.
 In the case of credits, some have failed to have a meaningful impact on emissions. 
 But that alone won’t be enough, especially as AI use ticks up.
 That’s why operators are turning to the strategy employed by Alphabet Inc unit Google called load shifting. The idea: Lower emissions by upending the way data centres function. 
 Today, most data centres seek to operate in a “steady state,” such that their energy consumption is fairly stable. 
 That leaves them at the mercy of the grid they’re connected to and whatever the day’s mix of natural gas, nuclear and renewable power generation is given the lack of transmission lines between regions. 
 To break their reliance on dirtier grids, tech giants are looking for opportunities to shift daily or even hourly  data centre   operations around the world in an effort to soak up excess renewable energy production.
 Google launched the first effort to match its power usage at certain data centres with zero-carbon power on an hourly basis in a bid to get its machines running on clean energy 24/7.
 No one has fully achieved that goal yet. 
 And, to be sure, the strategy of shifting loads around the world might be complicated by countries pushing for data sovereignty policies that attempt to restrict and safeguard the flow of data across borders. 
 But what Cirrus Nexus and Google are testing could still be a critical piece of the puzzle for cutting emissions. 
 Manhattan-based Cirrus Nexus scours the world’s power grids and measures emissions in five-minute increments to find the least polluting computing resources for itself and its clients in industries that range from pharmaceuticals to accounting.
 The company had a chance to put that search into practice last summer.
 The Netherlands was in the midst of its sunniest June on record, causing the cost of solar power on the grid to drop. That made it cheaper and less carbon-intensive to run servers. 
 Cirrus Nexus then shifted its computing load to California once the sun went down in the Netherlands, allowing it to draw on solar power just coming online for the day in the Golden State.  
 By chasing the sun from Europe to the US West Coast and back again, the company was able to slash computing emissions for certain workloads for itself and clients by 34% rather than relying on servers in either location alone, according to company data shared with Bloomberg Green.
 Making operations flexible to do that comes with both benefits and risks. Being able to pursue spare zero-carbon megawatts can help reduce stress on grids, such as during a heat wave or frigid winter storm. Blackout worry
 But data centres need to cooperate with utilities and grid operators because big swings in demand can throw electric systems into disarray, boosting the odds of blackouts. 
 Dominion Energy, which is seeing  data centre   demand soar at its Virginia utility, is working on a programme to harness load shifting at data centres to ease stress on the grid during extreme weather.
 In recent years, Google and Amazon have tested shifting  data centre  use for their own operations and for clients that use their cloud services. Cirrus Nexus, for instance, uses cloud services offered by Amazon, Microsoft and Google. 
 In Virginia, Microsoft inked a deal with Constellation Energy Corp  that guarantees more than 90% of the power for its area  data centre  will be zero-carbon energy.
 Reaching 100%, though, remains a formidable goal for it and other hyperscalers.
 Google’s data centres run on carbon-free energy about 64% of the time, with 13 of the regional sites getting to 85% and seven at just over 90% globally, said Michael Terrell, who leads Google’s 24/7 carbon-free energy strategy. 
 “But if you’re not displacing fossil assets, then you’re not completely achieving your climate goals,”  said Terrell. — Bloomberg",york tech giant ward carbon time bomb massive data centre building technique google gaining currency power hungry artificial intelligence online software hunt clean electricity excess sun wind grid data centre operation carbon cost urgent figure data centre renewable energy usage chris noble founder chief executive officer cirrus nexus cloud computing manager data centre google microsoft amazon climate risk worsen shift fossil fuel electricity clean power nvidia corp chief executive officer jensen huang cost data centre double power rise software data centre transmission network global consumption international energy agency iea responsible carbon dioxide hyperscalers biggest data centre owner microsoft amazon climate goal internal external pressure deliver lofty target operation rise havoc goal graphic unit key rise language model electricity central unit form training model power household estimate growth ability clean power energy consumption volatile akin sawtooth data centre operator challenge grid stability growth north american company power energy usage dave sterlace account director global data centre energy trend load lower data centre emission hyperscalers data centre provider massive amount solar wind farm credit emission credit meaningful impact emission tick operator strategy unit google load idea lower emission data centre data centre operate steady energy consumption stable leaf grid day natural gas nuclear renewable power generation lack transmission line region reliance dirtier grid tech giant opportunity data centre operation effort soak excess renewable energy production google effort match power usage data centre power hourly basis bid machine clean energy goal strategy load country data sovereignty policy restrict safeguard flow data border nexus google critical piece puzzle emission cirrus nexus power grid measure emission increment resource client industry pharmaceutical company chance search practice summer midst sunniest june record cost solar power grid drop cheaper carbon intensive server load california sun solar power online day golden chasing sun europe coast company slash emission client server company data bloomberg green operation flexible benefit risk spare carbon megawatt stress grid heat frigid winter storm blackout data centre utility operator swing throw electric system disarray odds blackout dominion energy data centre demand virginia utility programme harness load data centre stress grid extreme weather google amazon data centre operation client service nexus instance cloud service amazon microsoft google virginia microsoft deal constellation energy corp guarantee power data centre carbon energy remains formidable goal hyperscalers data centre free energy time regional site lead carbon free energy strategy fossil asset climate goal,"[(13, 0.9975623)]",13
653364,StarHealth,5,25/02/2024,What AI really is,"Is artificial intelligence a boon or bane to humanity, especially when it comes to healthcare?","EVERYBODY wants Artificial Intelligence (AI), and everybody wants it now. 
 As with most hype, it is worth taking a step back to understand what AI is, and perhaps just as importantly, what it is (or is not) suitable for. 
 The term “Artificial Intelli-gence” was coined in 1955 by Professor John McCarthy of Stanford University in the United States, who defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”.
 The concept has evolved to one in which machines simulate human intelligence in areas such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making. 
 These are done via algorithms and data analysis – the ability to recognise patterns, as well as provide analysis and insight that mimic the functions associated with human intelligence.
 What is a good AI?
 Just as how a human brain has certain prerequisites in order to function well, there are various factors that determine success in an AI.
 AI algorithms require high- quality and diverse datasets for proper training. 
 Narrow AI – i.e. where AI is used for one particular thing, e.g. AI for website chatbots – may not require as large a dataset, but still requires quality input.
 The basics are important – the data used to train AI must be of sufficient quality and with minimal bias. 
 Poor input will lead to poor output. 
 The data itself should be collected in a way that builds on trust, and should adhere to privacy and ethical guidelines.
 After data collection, the next steps are calculations – the processing of large datasets and the training of complex models that require very high computational resources. 
 High-performance processors accelerate the training and inference processes, enabling faster and more efficient computations.
 The need for such processing power is the driving force behind the high valuation of Nvidia, one of the top tech companies with a market capitalisation at more than US$1.8 trillion (RM8.6 trillion, at the time of writing).
 Dealing with datasets and AI require appropriate skillsets. 
 These include expertise in machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. 
 Researchers and data scientists have to design and optimise algorithms to achieve specific goals, such as classification, regression, clustering or reinforcement learning, depending on the application domain and task requirements.
 Specific domain expertise is crucial in understanding the context and utilisation of AI in specific sectors, e.g. healthcare professionals for AI in medicine, financial analysts for AI in finance, etc. 
 This is important to ensure that mistakes are minimised and results can be utilised in real-world contexts.
 All of the above can – and should – only be allowed if there is adherence to ethical principles and regulatory standards. 
 This is to ensure fairness, transparency, accountability and privacy protection. 
 Ethical AI frameworks promote responsible AI practices, mitigate biases and address societal implications. 
 This is the rationale for the European Union introducing its AI Act, the first major legislation that codifies AI protections into law.
 The advantages of AI
 The primary value of an AI is the ability to process and analyse vast amounts of data at speed far beyond that of the human mind.
 This is particularly useful in repetitive or mundane tasks, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex and creative endeavours.
 AI can also analyse complex datasets to identify patterns, trends and correlations that may not be apparent to humans. 
 Future outcomes and trends can be identified by analysing historical data and identifying predictive patterns. 
 At a more granular level, AI systems can perform tasks with a high degree of accuracy and precision, often surpassing human capabilities. 
 In fields such as medical diagnosis, radiological image recognition and quality control, AI algorithms can achieve levels of accuracy that are difficult for humans to replicate consistently.
 At a more personal level, AI algorithms can tailor experiences and recommendations to individual preferences and behaviours. 
 In fields such as ecommerce, entertainment and healthcare, personalised recommendations based on AI analysis can enhance customer satisfaction and engagement.
 The downside of AI
 One of the primary criticisms of AI is the potential for bias; AI learns from historical data, which may contain biases inherent in the data and the collection process. 
 If this data reflects societal biases or systemic inequalities, AI algorithms can perpetuate, and even exacerbate them. 
 There are various examples of biased training data leading to discriminatory outcomes in loan approvals, and even court decisions.
 The algorithms are also complex with minimal transparency and interpretability. 
 It is not wrong to say that very few people actually understand what happens with an AI, and for the majority of us, it is very important to be cognisant of what we do not know – there is no room to blindly trust or apportion infallibility to an AI without knowing how it arrives at a decision, especially without accountability, fairness and trust.
 The increasing ubiquity, overreliance and dependency on AI can lead to complacency and a lack of critical thinking. 
 One must not overlook the errors, biases and limitations of AI, such as its inability to make decisions based on moral or value judgements.
 AI in healthcare
 Given the context above, one can start to imagine the opportunities and limitations of AI in enhancing healthcare delivery.
 Healthcare is rich in data: symptoms can be analysed for diagnosis, treatment can be identified at genetic level, AI-powered remote devices can monitor signs, algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify potential drug candidates – the list goes on.
 However, it is not a panacea and should be recognised as such.
 There is bias within algorithms, data privacy and security concerns, misinterpretation of data within training modules that are not properly validated, overreliance on technology by practitioners, increasing inequality due to cost considerations – once again, the list goes on.
 AI is changing the world, even as it is changing in its own nature over time. 
 There is tremendous potential, but this has to be viewed alongside the challenges of data privacy, bias and regulatory issues to ensure that AI is implemented ethically and responsibly in all its settings, including healthcare. 
 As I wrote at the start of this column, it is worth taking a step back to understand what AI is, and just as importantly, what it is not.

653414,Lifestyle,5,25/02/2024,What’s the real threat of AI?,Maybe it’s not an army of robots. Maybe it’s AI simply making life so easy that we lose the motivation to live.,"EARLIER this week, Open AI – the creators of ChatGPT, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) that, as we all know, is coming for our jobs – released Sora, a text to video app that “dances on the edge of reality and dreams” – or so says Microsoft Co-pilot, an AI that is powered by ChatGPT.
 But to put it simply, Sora looks incredible.
 Puppies playing in the snow, a woman waking up with her cat licking her, landscape shots of a pre-war Swiss village – if someone didn’t tell me all of it was generated by AI, I would have no clue.
 And keep in mind 10 months ago the best we could do with text to video was a warped and morphing version of Will Smith eating noodles like an AI generated monster (if you haven’t seen it, look it up and prepare to feel nauseous). As I’ve said before, AI is progressing faster than any tech we’ve ever built.
 Which is great. AI is going to be a terrific tool for productivity – it already is in an increasing number of fields. 
 And when people talk about AI companies they’re really not looking at it correctly; it’s like calling companies “Internet companies” back in the early 2000s. Would you call any company an Internet company now? They’re all Internet companies. The Internet is table stakes. That’s what AI is going to be. Every company will use AI in some capacity.
 But this particular aspect of AI, this text to video technology, is incredible. And it has vast implications for the industry I work in, namely film and TV. It’s a good thing SAG (Screen Actors Guild, the American actors union) went on strike last year and hopefully got some favourable terms to avoid human actors being replaced by AI – because that’s what watching Sora immediately makes me think.
 Actors are expensive. But they’re worth it because they pull in the audience. But what if we can now just generate an actor with the charisma of Brad Pitt, the biceps of Henry Cavil, and the cool of Timothy Chalamet? Finished.
 This is when text to video could conceivably get really good. Instead of watching stories about people and events that never really happened, we’ll be watching stories about people and events that never happened starring people that never existed.
 Then what happens when AI can write just as well or better than human writers? It will never happen, people say. I say, never say never. And look at how good AI has become in two years. I see it as inevitable. At some point in my lifetime, we will watch a fully AI-generated film from script to visuals to direction.
 Now let’s take this a little further.
 What if Netflix can read your face and tell what kind of film you want to watch? What if from this reading of your mood, AI generates a script, based on your preferences AI generates a cast for your film, and then AI executes all of this for your viewing pleasure?
 Now we’re all siloed and not even media brings us back together because I’m watching a film tailored to myself and so is everyone else watching things tailored to them. Maybe Netflix makes us the stars of the films we watch, depending on how narcissistic we are, maybe that’s a thing we want to see. We trick ourselves into believing we’re the heroes in the stories we watch.
 You might think this is farfetched, but I believe we’ll get there faster than we think. AI is going to bring a lot of good. It will make our lives easier in so many ways, its potential uses for improving healthcare and medicine is incredible. Actually, we’re already feeling its effects and have been for a few years, as AI and machine learning are already a part of many businesses.
 But the fears that AI will destroy our civilisation are still there, the idea that AI will rise up against humankind and build an army of robots to battle us. Maybe AI doesn’t have to do that to destroy our civilisation. Maybe all AI has to do is make it too easy for us to get what we want, and watch as we drift off into our own little bubbles and slowly die off. Maybe that’s the real threat of AI.

652246,StarMetro,10,22/02/2024,AI course partnership boon for state’s tech ambitions,"S’gor hopes to nurture talents in data analytics, machine learning","A total of 31 final-year  degree students graduated  from a course aimed at giving them intensive training in  data analytics and machine learning.
 The AI Nusantara programme at Universiti Selangor (Unisel) in Kuala Selangor was taught by Selangor Digital School (SDS).
 It is a collaboration between Selangor Information Technology and Digital Economy Cooperation (Sidec), which is a subsidiary of Invest Selangor Bhd, and The Hive Southeast Asia, which offers early-stage financing for startups.
 The month-long programme came with internship placements with 105 leading tech companies that have agreed to cooperate with Sidec and SDS.
 One of the students at the  graduation ceremony held at I-City in Shah Alam was Unisel computer science (industrial computing) student Aleeya Umairah Mohd Isa, 21.
 She said the AI Nusantara programme exposed her to apps used by consumers on a daily basis.  
 “It helped me learn beyond classroom walls,” she said.
 Currently serving her internship at a smart home solution and security company, Aleeya said she hoped to reach the level of the company’s top programmer who could not only write software but create new products as well.  
 Another graduate, Unisel information technology student Mas Nor Zalia Elisa Mat Zahid, 21, said she signed up for the free programme as she viewed it as an opportunity to get a jump start in the job market. 
 Guests of honour at the ceremony were Selangor Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari and state investment, trade and mobility committee chairman Ng Sze Han. 
 Also present was Sidec chief executive officer Yong Kai Ping, who said SDS aimed to nurture 600 talents this year. 
 “The programme is designed to address the shortage of workforce in the artificial intelligence (AI) field, particularly in digital marketing and prompt engineering. 
 “Our goal is to see these students working in leading tech companies and not end up in other fields,” said Yong.
 Ng, in his speech, said the programme was helping to create a tech-savvy workforce that would be much needed in smart cities. 
 Amirudin, who presented certificates to the graduates, said the programme was a step in the right direction towards Selangor developing its own technology hub with an aim to providing the private sector with a capable workforce.
 A memorandum of understanding stipulating the credits of cloud services between YTL Power International Bhd and SDS was also handed over during the ceremony.",total final degree student intensive training data analytics machine nusantara programme universiti selangor unisel kuala selangor selangor digital school sd collaboration selangor technology digital economy cooperation sidec subsidiary invest selangor bhd hive southeast asia stage financing startup month internship placement tech company cooperate sidec sd student graduation ceremony city shah alam unisel computer science industrial student aleeya umairah mohd isa nusantara programme apps consumer daily basis classroom wall internship smart solution security company aleeya level company top programmer write software create product graduate unisel technology student ma zalia zahid free programme opportunity jump job market ceremony selangor mentri besar datuk seri amirudin shari investment trade mobility committee chairman sze han sidec chief executive officer sd nurture talent address shortage workforce artificial intelligence field digital marketing prompt engineering goal student tech company speech programme tech savvy workforce smart city certificate graduate step direction selangor technology hub aim private sector capable workforce memorandum credit cloud service power international bhd sd ceremony,"[(9, 0.9936055)]",9
652302,StarBiz,14,22/02/2024,AI model backed by Asia’s richest person to  launch in March,,"MUMBAI: A consortium backed by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd and India’s top engineering schools aim to launch its first ChatGPT-style service next month.
 This is a big step in the country’s ambitions to become a player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
 The BharatGPT group, encompassing an arm of India’s most valuable company and eight affiliated universities, offered a sneak peek of the large language model on Tuesday during a technology conference in Mumbai. 
 In a video played before delegates, a motorcycle mechanic in southern India queried an AI bot in his native Tamil, a banker conversed with the tool in Hindi and a developer in Hyderabad used it to write computer code.
 If successful, the model – dubbed Hanooman after the half-monkey Hindu deity – will represent an advance for India in the accelerating race to develop potentially transformative AI technology. 
 BharatGPT envisions the model working via 11 local languages in four main fields: health care, governance, financial services and education. 
 It developed the model in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology universities including in Bombay, backed by wireless carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and India’s government. 
 A swath of startups such as Sarvam and Krutrim, backed by prominent venture capital investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and billionaire Vinod Khosla’s fund, are also building open-sourced AI models customised for India. 
 While Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI are building ever-larger large language models (LLMs), those efforts involve workarounds because of computational constraints and simpler models affordable to smaller businesses and government departments.
 “It’s a different genre of LLMs,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, chairman of IIT Bombay’s department of computer science and engineering. 
 Hanooman will also offer speech-to-text capabilities, making it vastly more user-friendly, he said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual Nasscom Information Technology Industry Conference. — Bloomberg",mumbai consortium mukesh ambani reliance industry top engineering school launch chatgpt style service month step country ambition player field artificial intelligence bharatgpt arm india valuable company university sneak peek language model tuesday technology conference mumbai video delegate mechanic southern india bot native tamil banker tool hindi developer hyderabad computer code successful model hanooman half monkey hindu deity represent advance india race transformative technology bharatgpt envisions local language main field health care governance financial service education model collaboration indian institute technology university bombay wireless carrier reliance jio india government swath startup krutrim prominent venture capital investor venture partner vinod khosla fund building model india silicon valley company larger language model effort workarounds computational constraint simpler model affordable business government department llm ganesh ramakrishnan chairman bombay department computer science engineering hanooman speech text capability friendly interview sideline annual nasscom technology industry conference bloomberg,"[(1, 0.99318534)]",1
652044,Main,4,21/02/2024,‘AI cannot replace journalists’,Fahmi: It lacks the human factor of interaction among people,"PUTRAJAYA: Artificial intelligence (AI) cannot replace professional journalism due to its limitations and “lack of human heart”, says Fahmi Fadzil.
 The Communications Minister said the human factor of interacting between people was an important part of being a journalist that AI could not replicate.
 “Journalists’ jobs can never become redundant as while AI is able to chug out professional articles quickly, it lacks the personal connection and touch that only human journalists are able to incorporate into stories.
 “This includes things such as being able to have one-to-one interviews and the ability to express unique experiences when they travel to the site for the story.
 “AI is mostly only able to write about 60% of an article based on facts as the remaining parts can only be filled by the human mind with emotions and personal experiences,” he said here yesterday.
 Instead of doom, Fahmi suggests that journalists utilise AI to reduce their workload by helping to craft better stories with quicker and easier verifying of facts.
 To this, Fahmi said he plans to hold discussions with the Malaysian Press Institute on creating more AI training sessions and modules for journalists in the country.
 Meanwhile, Fahmi said there are no plans to allocate funds for “exclusive deals” that encourage popular foreign artistes to perform in the country.
 Such deals were handled entirely by private companies, he said, explaining that the government’s role was to approve applications by these companies.
 “Most of these exclusive concert events are organised and agreed upon between private companies that sign contracts to bring in artistes to perform in a single country at a region.”
 Citing an example, he said the concert by British rock band Muse in Malaysia last year was a result of discussions held among the organisers.
 Fahmi said his ministry would focus only on simplifying the approval procedures as there had been complaints about the slow process.
 “Any decision to allocate funding to bring in foreign artistes is entirely up to the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry,” he said.
 Fahmi was asked if the government would consider allocating funds to secure exclusivity deals with popular celebrities to perform in Malaysia.",putrajaya artificial intelligence professional journalism limitation human heart fahmi fadzil communication minister human factor people replicate journalist job chug professional article personal connection touch human journalist story interview ability unique experience site story write article human mind emotion personal experience yesterday doom fahmi journalist workload craft story easier fahmi plan discussion malaysian press institute training session journalist country plan allocate fund exclusive deal popular foreign artiste country deal private company government role application company exclusive concert event agreed private company contract artiste single country region concert british rock band muse malaysia result discussion organiser ministry focus approval procedure complaint slow process decision allocate funding foreign artiste tourism culture ministry fahmi government fund secure exclusivity deal popular celebrity malaysia,"[(6, 0.6191958), (10, 0.37345546)]",6
651358,StarBiz,6,19/02/2024,AI still useful in finance sector despite deepfake and bias risks,,"New York: A bank uses biased artificial intelligence (AI) outputs in a mortgage lending decision. An insurance firm’s AI produces racially homogeneous advertising images. Users of an AI system complain about a bad experience.
 These are just a few of the potential risks AI poses for financial institutions that want to embrace the emerging technology, according to a series of papers released last Thursday. 
 The papers, by FS-ISAC, a nonprofit that shares cyber intelligence among financial institutions around the world, highlights additional pitfalls as well, including deepfakes and “hallucinations,” when large language models provide incorrect information presented as facts.
 Despite those risks,  the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) outlines many potential uses for AI for financial firms, such as improving cyber defenses. The group’s work outlines the risks, threats and opportunities that artificial intelligence offers banks, asset managers, insurance firms and others in the industry.
 “It was taking our best practices, our experiences, our knowledge, and putting it all together, leveraging the insights from other papers as well,” said Mike Silverman, vice-president of strategy and innovation at FS-ISAC.
 AI is being used for malicious purposes in the financial sector, though in a fairly limited way. For instance, FS-ISAC said hackers have crafted more effective phishing emails, often refined through large language models like ChatGPT, intended to fool employees into leaking sensitive data. In addition, deepfake audios have tricked customers into transferring funds, Silverman said. 
 FS-ISAC also warned of data poisoning, in which data fed into AI models is manipulated to produce incorrect or biased decisions, and the emergence of malicious large language models that can be used for criminal purposes.
 Still, the technology can also be used to strengthen the cybersecurity of these firms, according to the reports. 
 Already, AI has shown to be effective in anomaly detection, or singling out suspicious, abnormal behavior in computer systems, Silverman said. 
 In addition, the technology can automate routine tasks such as log analysis, predict potential future attacks and analyze “unstructured data” from social media, news articles and other public sources to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, according to the papers. 
 To safely implement AI, FS-ISAC recommends testing these systems rigorously, continually monitoring them, and having a recovery plan in the case of an incident. — Bloomberg",york bank artificial intelligence output mortgage lending decision insurance firm homogeneous advertising image user system complain bad experience potential risk pose financial institution technology series paper thursday paper isac nonprofit share intelligence financial institution highlight additional pitfall deepfakes hallucination language model incorrect risk financial service analysis center isac potential financial firm cyber defense risk threat artificial intelligence offer bank asset manager insurance firm industry practice knowledge insight paper silverman vice president strategy innovation isac malicious purpose financial sector limited instance isac hacker effective phishing email language model fool employee sensitive data addition audio customer fund silverman isac data data model incorrect decision malicious language model criminal purpose technology cybersecurity firm effective anomaly detection suspicious abnormal behavior computer system silverman addition technology routine task analysis potential future attack unstructured data social medium news public source potential threat vulnerability paper implement isac system monitoring recovery plan incident bloomberg,"[(13, 0.9936043)]",13
651330,StarBiz,12,19/02/2024,OpenAI in investor deal valuing it at US$80bil,,"San Francisco: OpenAI has concluded a deal with investors that reportedly values the California start-up at US$80bil or more, after a roller-coaster year for the inventor of ChatGPT.
 The agreement, reported by The New York Times but not yet confirmed by OpenAI, would mean the value of the company – a world leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) – would have nearly tripled in under 10 months.
 The reported deal would have the San Francisco-based firm selling existing shares to investors led by Thrive Capital.
 It would permit executives and employees to sell shares at a highly favorable price, just three months after the firm survived a major crisis when company co-founder and chief executive Sam Altman was fired and then brought back only days later.
 OpenAI led a revolution in AI when it placed its ChatGPT programme online in late 2022.
 The immediate success of the interface sparked tremendous interest in the cutting-edge technology, capable of producing text, sounds and images upon demand.
 Microsoft, already an investor in the start-up, redoubled its involvement. The software giant has injected some US$13bil into OpenAI in the past few years.
 It is locked in fierce competition with Google to roll out new tools using AI’s generative abilities, to the point that the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in January launched an investigation into the enormous investments by Microsoft, Google and Amazon in the specialised startups.
 OpenAI, founded as a non-profit in 2015, faced a major crisis last November.
 Its board fired chief executive officer Sam Altman, one of Silicon Valley’s more charismatic figures, accusing him of a lack of “transparence”.
 In the following days, Microsoft tried to hire him, while both executives and a majority of OpenAI employees demanded that those behind Altman’s ouster resign and that he be rehired.
 Within the week, Altman was back at work while several board members resigned.

651528,Lifestyle,5,19/02/2024,Anti-AI tool for artists,,"Unveiled last year and now available for download, Nightshade is a tool capable of “fooling” the artificial intelligence (AI) models currently used for automatic image generation.
 The idea is to help artists prevent their work from being misused without their knowledge or consent.
 Unless specifically blocked, generative AI models can now be trained on any content found on the Internet.
 This obviously poses a number of problems for artists and content creators who do not want their work to be used as part of the AI training process. 
 Effective solutions to “trick” these generative AI models include Nightshade.
 This tool has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of Chicago and is designed to enable artists to invisibly alter the pixels representing their work in order to disrupt AI models that are prone to using such images without authorisation in their learning process.
 Its creators even describe it as a veritable potential “poison pill” for these models, with serious malfunctions that could affect the training data and even render them unusable should such activity become widespread.
 The models referred to are those on which the best-known image-creating AIs, such as Midjourney and Dall-E, are based.
 In practice, these images would no longer be interpreted correctly, with a dog being mistaken for a cat, a house for a cake, and so on.
 Nightshade’s aim, ultimately, is not to disrupt AI models but to ensure that licensing images from their creators one day becomes the norm. The tool is now available to download from the university website.
 Nightshade joins Glaze, another solution the same researchers previously created that enables image manipulation so that models trained for AI do not pick them up.
 Of course, these tools will only be effective as long as these models are unable to detect, recognise and decode these manipulations.
 The day that AI is powerful enough to get past them, other solutions will need to be found. – AFP Relaxnews",unveiled download nightshade tool capable artificial intelligence model automatic image generation idea knowledge consent generative model content internet pose content creator process effective solution generative model tool team researcher university chicago enable artist pixel disrupt model image process creator veritable potential poison pill model malfunction data render unusable activity widespread model image ai midjourney dall practice image mistaken cat house cake nightshade aim disrupt model image creator day tool download university website nightshade glaze solution researcher enables image manipulation model pick tool effective model unable detect recognise decode manipulation day powerful solution relaxnews,"[(4, 0.9895098)]",4
651163,Main,35,18/02/2024,Tech giants ink pact on AI deepfakes,Companies commit to detecting deceptive content that trick voters during polls,"MUNICH: Major technology companies signed a pact to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world.
 Executives from Adobe, Ama­zon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference on Friday to announce a new frame­work for how they respond to AI-generated deepfakes that deli­­berately trick voters. 
 Twelve other companies, inclu­ding Elon Musk’s X, are also signing on to the accord.
 “Everybody recognises that no one tech company, no one government, no one civil society organization is able to deal with the advent of this technology and its possible nefarious use on their own,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in an interview ahead of the summit.
 The accord is largely symbolic but targets increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video “that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote”.
 The companies are not committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content when it is created or distributed on their platforms. 
 It noted that the companies will share best practices with each other and provide “swift and proportionate responses” when that content starts to spread.
 The vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies. 
 But disappointed advocates were looking for stronger assurances.
 “The language isn’t quite as strong as one might have  expected,” said Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Centre. 
 “I think we should give credit where credit is due and acknowledge that the companies do have a vested interest in their tools not being used to undermine free and fair elections. 
 “That said, it is voluntary, and we’ll be keeping an eye on whether they follow through.”
 Clegg said each company “quite rightly has its own set of content policies”.
 “This is not attempting to try to impose a straitjacket on everybody,” he said. 
 “And in any event, no one in the industry thinks that you can deal with a whole new technological paradigm by sweeping things un­­der the rug, tr­ying to play whack-a-mole and fin­ding everything that you think may mislead someone.”
 Several political leaders from Europe and the United States also joined Friday’s announcement.
 European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said while such an agreement cannot be comprehensive, “it contains very impactful and positive elements”.
 She also urged fellow politicians to take responsibility in not using AI tools deceptively and warned that AI-fuelled disinformation could bring about “the end of democracy, not only in the EU member states”.

651160,StarEdu,4,18/02/2024,Building our ownAI talents,Tech crucial in realising Malaysia’s high-income ambition,"Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) education will play a significant role in Malaysia’s goal of becoming a high-income nation.
 This, said Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) Faculty of Information Science and Technology senior lecturer Dr Lailatul Qadri Zakaria, is because AI can contribute to the country’s economic growth, innovation and competitiveness in many different ways.
 The adoption and deployment of AI technologies, she added, drive innovation and productivity across various economic sectors; transform manufacturing, healthcare, finance, agriculture and logistics industries; and address many of the social challenges we are currently facing.
 “Countries with a skilled AI workforce and supportive ecosystem are more likely to attract foreign investment and talent.
 “It also presents opportunities for Malaysian entrepreneurs and startups to develop innovative AI-driven solutions and create new businesses,” she said.
 The Academy of Sciences Malaysia, in a reply to StarEdu, said integrating AI into education and training programmes is vital for developing a skilled workforce capable of thriving in the digital economy. 
 “This not only addresses unemployment challenges but also positions Malaysia as a competitive player in emerging AI-related fields. 
 “Moreover, leveraging AI in public services, such as healthcare and transportation, can significantly improve efficiency and enhance the quality of life for citizens through smart city initiatives,” ASM said.
 Lailatul Qadri, who does research with AI, said those possessing a degree that specialises in AI will find it very easy to find a job upon graduating as they are part of an important talent pool for Malaysia. 
 AI, she added, opens many career opportunities across various industries.
 Indeed, such a degree can lead you to creating your own social media filter, a chatbot to answer texts automatically or even Malaysia’s own version of ChatGPT.
 “There is a high demand for AI experts globally. Data analysts, software developers, and AI ethics consultants are just some of the vacancies to fill,” Lailatul Qadri said, adding that many multinational companies and research institutions actively recruit AI talents from around the globe, offering opportunities for international collaboration and experience.
 The country’s efforts to develop research in the field of AI and to become a national and global research hub led to the conceptualisation of the UKM Centre for AI Technology in 2005.
 Lailatul Qadri said research groups at the centre focus on different areas such as data mining and optimisation, pattern recognition, knowledge technology, and vision system and mixed reality.
 The centre, she said, had also contributed to the drafting of the Malaysian AI Roadmap.Showing how serious the country is in growing our AI talent, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had also announced the establishment of Malaysia’s first AI Faculty in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) when tabling Budget 2024.
 The faculty will begin its academic programme this October at the university’s Kuala Lumpur campus, said UTM vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Fauzi Ismail.
 “Some 120 students will be the faculty pioneers (and) start their lessons for the 2024/25 academic year in October.
 “The duration of their course will be about three years,” he said at the Skudai campus in January.
 Talent critical
 Asia Pacific University Of Technology & Innovation (APU) vice-chancellor Prof Dr Ho Chin Kuan said big tech companies like Tesla and Telekom need AI talent to design and build the applications.
 Besides big tech companies, he said banks were also using AI for fraud detection and customer loan disbursement.
 It is also being used to optimise field logistics, he added.
 While some jobs are becoming obsolete, Prof Ho said those with a degree in AI will always be in demand so long as there is automation.
 “Now, they are even looking into using AI to generate other AI,” he said.
 Prof Ho added that studying AI was not a top choice for school leavers a decade ago.
 “Back then, courses such as data science and software engineering were more popular,” he said, adding that today, the enrolment in AI programmes is shooting up across the board.
 “More are realising the need to learn AI which will lead to a continued rise in enrolment demand.
 “In fact, it is now a challenge for many universities to get good talent to come and teach AI,” Prof Ho said, adding that one needs passion to learn AI.
 He said the university started its AI programme back when there was a boom in cloud computing.
 This, he said, was necessary for AI as a normal computer would not be able to handle an AI workload.
 While interest in AI has been growing over the past few years, Prof Ho said it is not a recent innovation.
 “What’s happened now compared to 20 or 30 years ago is that the computing power has grown so much and it’s easier to achieve more functionalities for AI today,” he added.
 Prof Ho said APU offers a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a specialisation in AI.
 “Once students have mastered the basics (of computer science), we teach them how to incorporate intelligence when managing different modalities. 
 “For example, we teach students how to incorporate intelligence for recognising images just like what humans do. We teach students the technique of getting machines to understand text, image and sound data,” he said, adding that upon graduation, these students would be able to incorporate AI into all sorts of modalities.
 “The whole idea of the programme is to produce engineers who can design, develop, deploy and maintain AI systems,” said Prof Ho.
 Ultimately, he added, the idea is for the graduates to be technology developers.
 The university, like many other higher education institutions around the world, also incorporates AI-based subjects into its other degree programmes to create graduates who are technology users.
 This, said Prof Ho, is crucial as technology has a presence in a myriad of industries from engineering to finance and accounting.
 At UKM, there are two AI tracks offered to  undergraduates as part of the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science (Hons) programme, said Lailatul Qadri.
 They can choose between Data Science and Intelligent Machines which will be taught in their second year, she said.
 She said the number of students enrolled in the programme have been increasing over the years.
 Currently, there are 234 students in the programme.
 “The demand is very high and we have added seats but due to resource constraints, we cannot increase the spots by too much.
 “We cannot compromise quality for quantity,” she added.
 Lailatul Qadri said the faculty provides certain courses, such as Introduction to Information Technology that talks about basic AI, for students outside the faculty.
 Other faculties, such as the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, also conduct their own AI-based courses.
 “AI can be used across multiple disciplines, from computer science and engineering to healthcare, business, and social sciences. 
 “Integrating AI into courses across faculties can provide students with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills relevant to various career paths.
 “UKM is paying more attention to including AI into other programmes which aligns with global trends and the changing needs of the job market, research community, and society as a whole,” she added.
 Lailatul Qadri said that AI learning is very open nowadays.
 Even the government has launched “AI for Rakyat” (see infobox), a free module for Malaysians to learn the basic use and ethics of AI.
 “The resources are all available on the web for free,” she said, adding that what is needed is interest, patience and a strong foundation in mathematics.
 “Awareness of AI is so important right now so that people do not get scammed,” she said.
 Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology Department of Multimedia lecturer Prof Dr Rahmita Wirza O.K. Rahmat said graduates who possess AI skills can expect to see their career prospects become even more promising.
 “As the demand for AI continues to increase rapidly, so does the scope for job opportunities in this field,” she said.
 However, she advised students not to “become so obsessed” with AI that they indirectly ignore the importance of fields of science other than AI. 
 “Also, ensure that existing AI systems or applications are not misused by emphasising ethical awareness,” she said.Futureproof talents
 I initially didn’t know much about AI except that it was a new thing in IT. It was only after taking classes during my computer science degree programme that I realised how broad the field is and learnt about the many opportunities in AI. What I found attractive about AI is that it’s a new technology. So we are still learning through trial and error when we encounter problems. Even when you search for solutions online, sometimes there are no answers. It is stressful but at the same time, it is very interesting and fruitful when we are able to solve a problem. I still need to learn a lot more about the field because it is so vast. I am planning to pursue a master’s in AI when I am done with my degree. Only then will I join the corporate world. – Nur Sahira Sofea Azizan, 21AI is rapidly growing so I’m interested in how this latest technology can help solve real-world problems and ease the burdens of humanity. I have an interest in problem-solving and I think AI is the future. Nowadays, we use a lot of technology to help in our jobs. For example, in the medical field, there is medical imaging to help diagnosis. This is just one of the ways we can use AI to mimic human intelligence and to help society. I see myself going down this path. I want to use AI to contribute to the community too.– Shahrizal Ibrahim Jamaludin, 23I chose to study AI as it has become so important in our daily lives. AI technology is exploding with so many new things. Youths nowadays are already moving away from using search engines. Instead, many prefer keying prompts in generative AI tools like ChatGPT to search for something. I want to be a part of this growth. Maybe I will join a startup company after graduating to gain more skills and experience in this fast evolving field.– Muhammad Haikal Abdul Razak, 22Malaysia and AI> AI adoption is at an early to nascent stage at the national level with many companies already using AI to innovate their operations and business services.

651156,StarEdu,5,18/02/2024,"Zambry: Need for more AI, high-tech grads",,"Graduates in certain fields, especially artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programmes and the high-tech sector, need to be increased to meet industry and investor demands, says Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
 “There are certain areas that require more manpower due to the mismatch in skills driven by changes in the industry,” he said during a networking luncheon with the diplomatic missions in Malaysia on Feb 5.
 The gathering was to brief foreign diplomats from 72 missions about the future of the Malaysian higher education landscape as well as address issues and challenges faced by international students in completing their studies locally.
 During the event, Zambry shared that at a recent dialogue session with the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti), the Higher Education Ministry had recommended that foreign students be allowed to work in Malaysia post-graduation.
 “It serves our purpose in ensuring the physical and emotional welfare of our students who will go on to make great contributions in the workforce.
 “I have raised it during our dialogue and am pleased that Miti has taken it on for the good of everyone,” he said.
 On Feb 3, Investment, Trade And Industry Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the number of local graduates in the high-tech sector was insufficient to meet the demands of investors.
 Allowing foreign graduates from local higher education institutions (HEIs) to work temporarily in the country could address the need for more skilled workers, he said.
 Zambry said following the ministry’s discussion with Tengku Zafrul, efforts to meet industry demand for skilled graduates were underway, with the help of vice-chancellors of universities in the country to devise a solution to the constraints.
 Zambry said over the last three years, there have been a 6% average increase in the number of international students in Malaysia, with approximately 63,718 enrolled in private HEI’s.
 The ministry, he said, aimed to welcome students from all countries to study in Malaysia peacefully, and is looking at exploring better ways to assist foreign students in bringing their families along while pursuing postgraduate studies here.
 Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS) chief executive officer Novie Tajuddin said postgraduate students enrolled in public and private universities are eligible to apply for dependent passes on behalf of their families if they are citizens from the 17 Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries.
 Besides the visa processing issues, he said funding for postgraduate students who want to bring their parents along, has to be looked at.
 “We are assessing various possible methods to help them manage their family’s transition since our goal is to enhance Malaysia’s higher education presence on a global scale and reel in more foreign students to our shores,” he said.
 Malaysian Association of Private Colleges and Universities (Mapcu) president Datuk Dr Parmjit Singh said besides ensuring quality education, HEIs are responsible for providing robust pastoral care for international students.
 “I always remind my staff that every international student in our institution is somebody’s child, and that their parents bestow trust upon the university and the country to care for their children well.
 “I would like to assure all embassies and diplomats here that we promise to do everything we can to ensure every student in Malaysian HEIs is well cared for,” he said.",graduate field artificial intelligence literacy programme tech sector meet industry investor education minister datuk seri zambry abd kadir manpower mismatch skill industry luncheon diplomatic mission feb foreign diplomat mission future malaysian education landscape address issue international student study event zambry dialogue session investment trade industry ministry miti education ministry foreign student malaysia post graduation serf physical emotional welfare student contribution dialogue pleased miti feb investment trade industry minister datuk seri tengku zafrul abdul local graduate sector insufficient meet demand investor foreign graduate local education institution country address worker zambry ministry discussion zafrul effort industry demand graduate underway vice chancellor university country solution constraint average increase international student enrolled private hei ministry student country malaysia assist foreign student family postgraduate study malaysia global service chief executive officer novie tajuddin postgraduate student public private university eligible apply dependent pass behalf family organisation islamic cooperation oic country issue postgraduate student parent method family transition goal enhance malaysia education presence global scale reel foreign student malaysian association private college university president datuk parmjit singh quality education heis responsible robust pastoral care international student staff international student institution child parent bestow trust university country care child assure diplomat student malaysian heis,"[(6, 0.9951378)]",6
649536,StarBiz,6,15/02/2024,Malaysia is seeking UAE’s expertise to boost cooperation in AI,,"DUBAI: Malaysian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Datuk Seri Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin has expressed the country’s interest in learning from the UAE’s advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.
 The envoy said the potential to collaborate for mutual benefits could be further established and strengthened. 
 Ahmad Fadil was speaking to Bernama on the sidelines of the World Government Summitor WGS 2024 held here on Tuesday.
 Citing the global gathering’s theme “Shaping future governments” as a fantastic idea, Ahmad Fadil said: “In this context, I highly believe Malaysia will have the best opportunities to work with the UAE government as it is advanced in AI.”
 He also outlined Malaysia’s ambitions in renewable energy and data management and the potential for collaboration in both areas.
 “I believe the Malaysian government, through the renewable energy sector led by our Deputy Prime Minister who is also the Energy Transition and Public Utilities Minister, could further explore data centre and energy sector opportunities.
 “We have the expertise. It’s just that we need to tap into collaborations with leading entities in our country for mutual benefits in AI,” said Ahmad Fadil.
 In a move to bolster cooperation in renewable energy and AI, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and a delegation visited the Masdar City office and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence located within Masdar City last October.
 In January this year, the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) and the UAE’s Investment Ministry strengthened their commitment to advance investment cooperation in the digital infrastructure sector.
 Miti said both parties had signed a memorandum of understanding to mark a strategic partnership on the development of data centres in Malaysia with potential projects anticipated to achieve a total capacity of 500MW.

648478,StarBiz,5,12/02/2024,SoftBank sees new-found caution as secret weapon in AI arms race,,"FOR years, SoftBank Group splashed out billions on startups at near-peak valuations without batting an eye. 
 Now founder Masayoshi Son’s tech powerhouse is relying on a new weapon as it searches for the next big thing in AI: caution.
 The strategy marks a vast turnaround for a company that completely transformed the world of tech investing with its high-conviction bets on startups at an unheard of scale.
 It also highlights the lingering effect of SoftBank’s “defence mode”, a strategy it adopted after being hit by plummeting valuations in the aftermath of the pandemic, when higher interest rates eroded investor appetite for risk.
 “We’re being very prudent when we look at these opportunities out there,” Navneet Govil, the chief financial officer of Softbank’s investment arm, the Vision Fund, told Reuters in an interview last Thursday.
 “We’re financial investors not strategic investors.”
 The Vision Fund unit made just 29 new and follow-on investments in all of 2023 out of more than 300 companies it studied.
 The October-to-December quarter was the unit’s most miserly since 2017, with SoftBank saying the funds made US$100mil in new investments, a drop from the heady days of 2021, when they spent US$20.9bil in April to June alone.
 “It’s a good approach. Given the difficult period they went through, they’ve become very strict on choosing investees,” said Mitsunobu Tsuruo, an equity analyst at Citi who covers SoftBank.
 Last Thursday, SoftBank reported its first profit in five quarters, and a US$4bil investment gain at the Vision Fund business.
 Its war chest has ballooned to 4.4 trillion yen (US$29bil) in cash, cash equivalents and liquid bonds, it said.
 Even before the runaway success of chip design firm Arm, in which it owns around 90% and which listed in New York in September last year, SoftBank said it was exclusively focused on investing in artificial intelligence (AI).
 Arm’s share price surged more than 55% last Thursday, powered by forecasts of robust demand for its technology to design chips for AI features.
 SoftBank chief financial officer Yoshimitsu Goto said Arm would soon be indispensable to AI and has previously called the chip designer “the core of the core” of SoftBank’s group of companies.
 Early innings
 Potential investments could be in AI hardware, infrastructure or applications, Govil said.
 “We’re still in the early innings of a fast-growing space. 
 “These disruptors can easily by disrupted by other disruptors.”
 Companies will need to meet strict criteria about their “transformative” quality and capacity for AI innovation, product market fit and scalability, unit economics, and track record of execution, Govil added.
 But when it comes to AI, SoftBank has a mixed track record.
 Although chief executive officer Son has touted the promise of AI as an investment opportunity for some years, the vast majority of the more than 400 companies currently in the portfolio have not seen their valuations rise despite the excitement surrounding AI and AI-related companies over the past year.
 “There aren’t many winners in the AI market,” said Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors.
 Valuations have shot up for companies seen as direct beneficiaries of a rise in AI-related applications, such as chip maker Nvidia. 
 That means there will be fewer, if any, companies that can meet SoftBank’s more stringent criteria.
 “Everyone’s on top of this. The ship has sailed,” Anvarzadeh said.
 While Son has made some bad bets on companies, such as now bankrupt office-sharing business WeWork, he’s also backed some big winners including AliBaba, Arm and mobile Internet technology, so it may yet be too early to rule him out of further AI gains.
 “There’s also a high chance that they’ll make an extremely large, controlling stake investment,” Citi’s Tsuruo said. 
 “They would need to make sure they have the dry powder for it.” — Reuters

648592,Main,15,12/02/2024,AI vs human creativity?,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence has had such as impact on the world that the acronym “AI” was named 2023’s Word of the Year by Collins Dictionary.
 While many wax lyrical over generative AI’s advances, the developments have also been greeted with cynicism, especially among those who champion human creativity. And while I am an advocate of using AI to enhance teaching and learning, a small part of me is indeed worried about the possible impact it could have on the originality and creativity of our younger generation – which is undoubtedly already using AI and will continue to do so for the rest of their lives.
 As a university lecturer, one of the tasks that falls under my purview is to assess student presentations. After almost 20 years in academia, from the time I was an undergraduate myself until today, I’ve probably attended hundreds of presentations. And though education is quite different now compared with 20 years ago, surprisingly, student presentations have remained largely unchanged. 
 Considering the range of modern presentation tools available today, one would expect presentations to be noticeably different from one another. Instead, I often see presentations that, at their core, are all the same, just with different graphical assets and colour schemes. They seem to lack originality. 
 There are tools that offer thousands of visual assets, themes, and designs to help you make any kind of presentation you want. On the surface, that  sounds amazing! But does simply choosing a template from a library help students develop original thinking? Is it creative expression or merely a choice made on a whim?
 Additionally, these presentation tools now also come with generative AI to help users write content. So not only would the design and visual aesthetic of presentations lack student originality, even the written content could be generated by AI as well. 
 Assessment of student work is one aspect of education that needs to be reimagined thanks to AI. But more importantly, the development of student originality, creativity, and critical thinking could also be impacted by the use of generative AI – and this, to my mind, is of far greater concern. If students graduate with an underdeveloped sense of originality and a poorer capacity for critical thinking, how would that affect their careers? And if our graduates struggle to think creatively, what does that mean for future innovation in Malaysia?
 In the video game Detroit: Become Human (developer Quantic Dream), human-like robots live side-by-side with humankind. At one point in the game, players learn that in this fictional world set in 2038, less than 5% of music is made by humans, with the androids making the rest. We are unlikely to reach this point in real life in our lifetime, but I do believe that the rampant proliferation of generative AI will eventually begin to diminish human creativity if we are not careful.
 Generative AI can be a wonderful learning tool, yet we must ensure it does not rob us of our opportunities to grow.

647798,StarBiz,12,09/02/2024,Arm forecast beats estimates as AI spurs  chip upgrades,,"SAN FRANCISCO: Arm Holdings surged more than 30% after the British tech company forecast fiscal fourth-quarter sales and adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations as customers aim to design new chips for artificial intelligence (AI) work, generating higher royalties.
 Arm’s forecast ranges for its fourth quarter had midpoints of US$875mil for sales and 30 US cents per share for adjusted earnings, above estimates of US$780.3mil and 21 US cents per share, according to LSEG data.
 Arm shares rose roughly 35% in after-hours trading after the forecast and results were released. The over 30% surge in Arm’s stock after its report late on Wednesday lifted its market capitalisation by about US$26bil.
 Now trading at US$102.11, Arm has doubled from the US$51 price set in its September initial public offering.
 Arm raised its guidance by roughly US$100mil because markets such as automotive and AI are going to be strong in the fiscal fourth quarter, finance chief Jason Child told Reuters.
 The company expects licensing revenue for chips that power AI in data centres, phones and PCs to be a significant factor.
 “The solid Arm earnings and, even more importantly, their robust forecasts are good signs for both the company and the tech industry overall,” said Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.
 Since 2016 Arm has significantly diversified its business. Smartphones now represent 35% of overall units shipped, versus in 2016 when the percentage was between 60% and 70%, Child told Reuters.
 The proliferation of Arm designs into other markets demonstrates its growing influence across tech businesses, TECHnalysis Research analysts said. Yet despite its diversification, Arm is still a relatively small player in AI.
 For the full fiscal year, Arm expects US$3.18bil in revenue and adjusted earnings of US$1.22 per share, both above analysts’ estimates of US$3.05bil and US$1.07 per share.
 “We’re seeing more interest in newer designs and newer technologies by customers” due to interest in AI, Child said. “It’s real. Folks are actually buying and licensing that technology.”
 A new version of Arm designs doubled the company’s royalty revenue, as the more advanced technology commands a higher rate.
 For the fiscal third quarter, Arm reported sales of US$824mil and adjusted earnings of 29 US cents per share, topping Wall Street estimates of US$761.6mil and 25 US cents per share.

647978,Main,17,09/02/2024,AI ‘represents’ South-East Asians,Biased GPT? Singapore builds model to lessen reliance on Western tech data,"Like millions worldwide, South-East Asians have been trying out large language models (LLM) such as Meta’s Llama 2 and Mistral AI – but in their native Bahasa Indonesia or Thai. The result has usually been gibberish in English.
 This leaves them at a disadvantage, tech experts warn, as gene­rative artificial intelligence transforms education, work and governance worldwide.
 A Singapore government-led initiative aims to correct the imbalance with a South-East Asian LLM, the first in a family of models named SEA-LION – South-East Asian Languages in One Network – trained in the region’s languages and cultural norms.
 Trained on data in 11 South-East Asian languages including Vietnamese, Thai and Bahasa Indonesia, the open-sourced model is a cheaper and more efficient option for the region’s businesses, governments and acade­mia, said Leslie Teo at AI Singa­pore.
 “Do we want to force every person in South-East Asia to adapt to the machine or do we want to make it more accessible so people in the region can make full use of the technology without having to be an English spea­ker?” he said.
 “We are not trying to compete with the big LLMs; we are trying to complement them so there can be better representation of us,” Teo, senior director for AI pro­ducts, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 There are over 7,000 languages spoken worldwide. Yet, LLMs including Open AI’s GPT-4 and Meta’s Llama 2 that are used to build AI systems such as chatbots and other tools, have largely been developed for and are trained on the English language.
 Governments and tech firms are trying to bridge this gap, with India creating datasets in local languages, an LLM in the United Arab Emirates powering generative AI tools in Arabic and AI models in China, Japan and Viet­nam in local languages.
 These models can help local populations participate more equitably in the global AI economy that is largely dominated by big tech firms, said Nuurrianti Jalli, an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University’s school of communications.
 “Regional LLMs are also needed because they support technology self-reliance,” she said. “Less reliance on Western LLMs could provide better privacy for local populations and also align better with national or regional interest.”
 Multilingual language models that are trained on text from seve­ral languages at once can infer semantic and grammatical connections between high-resource languages that have more data and low-resource languages, researchers say.
 These models can be used in a variety of applications from translation to customer-service chatbots and content moderation on social media platforms that have struggled to identify hate speech in low-resource languages such as Burmese or Amharic.
 About 13% of SEA-LION’s data is sourced from South-East Asian languages – more than any other major LLM, said Teo. More than 9% of its data is from Chinese text and about 63% is from English.
 Multilingual language models often train on translated text and other poor-quality data that may have errors, so AI Singapore is “careful” about the data used in training SEA-LION, Teo said in his office at the National University of Singapore.
 “The age of pristine data has passed – a lot of the stuff on the internet now is material that is generated by LLMs, so we need to verify and filter,” he said.
 “We cannot be perfect, but we also cannot take out everything we consider to be bad,” he added.
 More governments are contri­buting data and businesses are testing SEA-LION, which, due to its smaller size, can be deployed faster and is cheaper to fine-tune and adopt, Teo said.
 As more countries and regions build their own LLMs, digital and human rights experts fret that they will reproduce only the domi­nant views expressed online, which can be particularly problematic in nations with authoritarian governments or strict media censorship, or those lacking a strong civil society.
 “Training models on such data risks perpetuating biased, prejudiced, incomplete and even misleading narratives,” said Jalli.
 “The models may fail to surface important socio-political issues like human rights abuse, corruption or valid criticism of political powers,” she said.
 If a model is only trained on favourable articles about a government, then the model is “likely to adopt a worldview where the government is wholly positive and leaves behind dissenting viewpoints,” said Aliya Bhatia, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a US non-profit.
 “Regional LLMs may better reflect the linguistic and cultural nuances of local language spea­kers, but they may also have less information about the world in general,” she added.
 “There is a real risk of government-backed models instilling a revisionist view of history and undermining democratic values.”
 But the alternative – relying entirely on Western LLMs with “disproportionately large influences” from wealthy, liberal, western democracies – means per­­petuating different biases related to cultural values, political beliefs and social norms, accor-ding to AI Singapore.
 “These LLMs have a very particular West Coast American bias – they are very woke. They do not represent us,” said Teo.
 “We are not saying ours is the only perspective – we are just trying to rebalance it.” — Reuters",million south east asian language model meta llama mistral native bahasa indonesia thai result gibberish english leaf tech expert gene rative artificial intelligence transforms governance worldwide government initiative aim imbalance south east asian llm family model sea lion east asian language network trained region cultural norm data east asian language vietnamese thai bahasa indonesia model efficient option region business government mia leslie teo singa pore force person south east asia adapt machine accessible people region technology english spea ker compete complement representation teo senior director pro duct thomson reuters language worldwide llm gpt meta llama build system chatbots tool trained english language government tech firm gap india datasets local language united arab generative tool arabic model japan viet nam local language model local population global economy tech firm jalli assistant professor oklahoma university school communication regional llm support technology reliance reliance western llm privacy local population national regional multilingual language model text seve ral language semantic grammatical connection language data low resource researcher model variety application customer service chatbots content moderation social medium platform identify hate speech low resource burmese amharic sea lion data south east asian language major llm teo data chinese text english multilingual language model translated text poor quality data error careful data sea lion teo office national university age pristine data lot stuff internet material llm verify filter perfect bad government data business sea lion size cheaper fine tune adopt teo country region llm digital human right expert domi nant view online problematic nation authoritarian government strict medium censorship strong civil society training model risk prejudiced incomplete narrative jalli model surface socio political issue human right abuse corruption valid criticism political power favourable article government model worldview government positive leaf viewpoint aliya bhatia policy analyst center democracy technology profit regional llm linguistic cultural nuance local language spea kers real risk government model revisionist view history democratic value western llm wealthy liberal western democracy bias cultural value political belief social norm singapore llm west coast american bias represent teo perspective rebalance reuters,"[(5, 0.37899983), (14, 0.6180897)]",14

 The agency, tasked with securing US borders, announced the hiring effort at an event in Mountain View, California, headlined by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen.
 “Government needs the support and expertise of our country’s foremost AI experts to help ensure our continued ability to harness this technology responsibly, safeguard against its malicious use, and advance our critical homeland security mission,” Mayorkas said in a statement.
 The agency did not provide specifics on what the experts will do, but noted that they would provide expertise in cybersecurity, data science and software engineering.
 The plan is part of the Biden administration’s nascent efforts to harness the potential benefits of AI while reining in the biggest threats it poses, where Europe has made much more significant progress.
 Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts, in recent months has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete and upend elections by making it difficult to distinguish between fact and false information.
 Officials on Tuesday highlighted ways that AI is already helping the DHS crack down on illegal drug imports by using a machine learning model to identify suspicious patterns in vehicles crossing the border, which has led to 240 drug seizures.
 The agency is also already using a machine learning model to enhance older images, allowing it to identify 300 previously unknown victims of sexual exploitation as well as some perpetrators. And AI is helping the department’s Federal Emergency Management Agency more efficiently assess damage to homes and buildings after a natural disaster.

 Another slide features graphs depicting OpenAI’s rapid user growth and projected revenue increases, and includes the line “OpenAI provides line of sight to xAI’s potential trajectory”. 
 Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.
 The deck also highlights Musk, the world’s richest person, and his history as an entrepreneur, with many of his other companies touted throughout the presentation. 
 Social network X, formerly Twitter, and electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc are both listed in the deck as strategic partners for xAI, and named as sources of training data for developing its technology. 
 One slide showed that Musk had raised billions of dollars across all his companies, the “Muskonomy,” as it’s called in the deck, as a way to offer evidence that Musk will be able to do the same with xAI.
 “XAI is led by a world-class entrepreneur in Musk with a demonstrated track record of building large cap market leaders, especially with deep tech/new frontier businesses that demand significant engineering expertise,” the presentation reads.
 Musk launched the startup last year as an alternative to OpenAI, which he co-founded and later left over philosophical differences about how to profit from the technology.

644448,Main,16,01/02/2024,AI in whistleblowing practices,,"WHILE whistleblowing has emerged as a linchpin for maintaining organisational integrity in Malaysian corporate governance, it still has to navigate a terrain fraught with cultural and legal complexities. 
 The Malaysian corporate ethos, traditionally respectful of hierarchy, often clashes with open criticism, which is essential for effective reporting of improper, illegal or immoral activity within organisations. 
 The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) 2010 facilitates disclosure of improper conduct in the public and private sector, protects persons making those disclosures from detrimental action, and provides for the matters disclosed to be investigated and dealt with. 
 Nevertheless, there is a cultural reluctance to embrace whistleblowing, which is often viewed as a risky pursuit.
 Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is now redefining the whistleblowing process. Its ability to dissect large datasets and identify unethical patterns brings an unprecedented level of objectivity and efficiency to whistleblowing. 
 AI becomes particularly crucial in a culture where direct criticism is often circumvented.
 Increasing awareness of the importance of whistleblowing within Malaysian organisations, as highlighted by the Deloitte 2023 Asia Pacific Conduct Watch Survey Report, underscores the need for stronger policy implementation and a cultural shift. 
 AI-driven platforms align well with the protective measures outlined in the WPA as they provide anonymity and confidential reporting channels. 
 However, the integration of AI into whistleblowing systems must be navigated carefully, considering Malaysia’s unique cultural and legal context.
 1. Begin by evaluating the existing whistleblowing infrastructure, understanding cultural nuances, legal frameworks, and identifying areas where AI can add value.
 2. Tailor the choice of AI tools to the organisation’s specific needs, focusing on data analysis for pattern recognition, secure communication channels, and automated report management systems. 
 3. Align the AI system with legal and ethical standards. Compliance with Malaysian laws, especially the Whistleblower Protection Act 2010 and ISO 37002 guidelines, is critical. 
 4. Update the organisation’s whistleblowing policies to incorporate AI use. Training sessions for employees should emphasise the importance of whistleblowing, the functionality of the AI-enhanced system, and assurances regarding protection and confidentiality.
 5. Deploy AI tools within the existing infrastructure, ensuring technical integration and seamless operation. Continuous monitoring of the system’s effectiveness and ethical operation is essential. 
 6. Establish a feedback loop from users of the whistleblowing system, using this input for ongoing improvement to ensure the system’s effectiveness and that it aligns with organisational values and legal requirements.
 7. Cultivate and nurture a culture that values transparency, ethical behaviour, and open communication.  
 The integration of AI into whistleblowing practices is a crucial step towards advancing a more ethical and transparent corporate environment in Malaysia. 
 It would bridge the gap between traditional corporate culture and modern ethical standards, thus offering a safer, more secure environment for whistleblowers.

644184,StarBiz,6,31/01/2024,"HE Group to seize opportunities in EVs, AI",Company to set up new offices in Johor and Kedah,"PETALING JAYA: Electrical engineering service provider HE Group Bhd remains upbeat on the semiconductor industry in 2024, backed by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and electric vehicles (EVs).
 Managing director Amos Haw Chee Seng said most EVs have high-end chips installed in them, which could result in a potential boom in the next two to three years for the industry.
 Haw added that with the geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, Malaysia would most likely benefit given Malaysia’s stable ecosystem.
 “Now the wave is coming for AI as well and we see a lot of data centres and chipmakers expanding their businesses and operations in Malaysia. These scenarios present a strategic opportunity for the group as an increasing number of existing and prospective customers are exploring expansion of their operations in Malaysia,” he told the media after the company’s listing ceremony yesterday.
 While the group has plans to address the expansion of data centres in Johor, Haw said the company is also looking to benefit from the recently announced Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone.
 “We plan to set up data centres there, so we can get a piece of the cake from that market,” he said.
 He added that, as part of its post-listing expansion plans, HE Group will open new offices in Kedah in addition to Johor, with plans to start operations by 2025.
 “There are a lot of investments in Kedah, especially in Kulim and all the semiconductor giants are there,” he added.
 Haw further stated that synergies between the group’s expansion plans, the government’s policies and its status as a listed company will further fuel its growth initiatives while capitalising on market opportunities.
 “Looking ahead, the opportunities presented by the government policies inject a refreshing sense of optimism, creating a favourable business environment for the group,” he said.
 HE Group debuted on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia at 43 sen a share, representing a 15 sen or 53.57% premium to its initial public offering (IPO) price of 28 sen a share. The stock closed at 32 sen yesterday.
 HE Group’s IPO saw an oversubscription of 63.35 times prior to its debut on the Ace Market.

643534,Main,16,29/01/2024,AI’s nefarious potential,,"WHEN the parole board in the US state of Louisiana met in October to discuss the potential release of a convicted murderer, it called on a doctor with years of experience in mental health to talk about the inmate.
 The board was not the only group paying attention.
 A collection of online trolls took screenshots of the doctor from an online feed of her testimony and edited the images with artificial intelligence tools to make her appear naked. They then shared the manipulated files on 4chan, an anonymous message board known for fostering harassment and spreading hateful content and conspiracy theories.
 It was one of numerous times that people on 4chan had used new AI-powered tools such as audio editors and image generators to spread racist and offensive content about people who had appeared before the parole board, according to Daniel Siegel, a graduate student at Columbia University who researches how AI is being exploited for malicious purposes. Siegel chronicled the activity on the site for several months.
 The manipulated images and audio have not spread far beyond the confines of 4chan, Siegel said. But experts who monitor fringe message boards said the efforts offered a glimpse at how nefarious internet users could employ sophisticated AI tools to supercharge online harassment and hate campaigns in the months and years ahead.
 Callum Hood, head of research at the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, said fringe sites such as 4chan – perhaps the most notorious of them all – often gave early warning signs for how new technology would be used to project extreme ideas.
 Those platforms, he said, are filled with young people who are “very quick to adopt new technologies” such as AI to “project their ideology back into mainstream spaces”.
 Those tactics, he said, are often adopted by some users on more popular online platforms.
 Here are several problems resulting from AI tools that experts discovered on 4chan – and what regulators and technology companies are doing about them.
 AI tools such as Dall-E and Midjourney generate novel images from simple text descriptions. But a new wave of AI image generators are made for the purpose of creating fake pornography, including removing clothes from existing images.
 “They can use AI to just create an image of exactly what they want,” Hood said of online hate and misinformation campaigns.
 There is no law in the United States banning the creation of fake images of people, leaving groups such as the Louisiana parole board scrambling to determine what can be done. The board opened an investigation in response to Siegel’s findings on 4chan.
 “Any images that are produced portraying our board members or any participants in our hearings in a negative manner, we would definitely take issue with,” said Francis Abbott, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole.
 “But we do have to operate within the law, and whether it’s against the law or not – that has to be determined by somebody else.”
 Illinois expanded its law governing revenge pornography to allow targets of non-consensual pornography made by AI systems to sue creators or distributors. California, Virginia and New York have also passed laws banning the distribution or creation of AI-generated pornography without consent.
 Late last year, AI company ElevenLabs released a tool that could create a convincing digital replica of someone’s voice saying anything typed into the program.
 Almost as soon as the tool went live, users on 4chan circulated clips of a fake Emma Watson, a British actor, reading Adolf Hitler’s manifesto, Mein Kampf.
 Using content from the Louisiana parole board hearings, 4chan users have since shared fake clips of judges uttering offensive and racist comments about defendants.
 Many of the clips were generated by ElevenLabs’ tool, according to Siegel, who used an AI voice identifier developed by ElevenLabs to investigate their origins.
 ElevenLabs rushed to impose limits, including requiring users to pay before they could gain access to voice-cloning tools. But the changes did not seem to slow the spread of AI-created voices, experts said.
 Scores of videos using fake celebrity voices have circulated on TikTok and YouTube – many of them sharing political disinformation.
 Some major social media companies, including TikTok and YouTube, have since required labels on some AI content.
 US President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October asking that all companies label such content and directed the Commerce Department to develop standards for watermarking and authenticating AI content.
 As Meta moved to gain a foothold in the AI race, the company embraced a strategy to release its software code to researchers. The approach, broadly called “open source,” can speed development by giving academics and technologists access to more raw material to find improvements and develop their own tools.
 When the company released Llama, its large language model, to select researchers last February, the code quickly leaked onto 4chan. People there used it for different ends: they tweaked the code to lower or eliminate guardrails, creating new chatbots capable of producing antisemitic ideas.
 The effort previewed how free-to-use and open-source AI tools can be tweaked by technologically savvy users.
 “While the model is not accessible to all, and some have tried to circumvent the approval process, we believe the current release strategy allows us to balance responsibility and openness,” a spokesman for Meta said in an email.
 In the months since, language models have been developed to echo far-right talking points or to create more sexually explicit content. Image generators have been tweaked by 4chan users to produce nude images or provide racist memes, bypassing the controls imposed by larger technology companies. — ©2024 The New York Times Company",parole board potential release murderer doctor experience mental health talk board attention collection online troll doctor online feed testimony image artificial intelligence tool manipulated file anonymous message board harassment hateful content conspiracy theory numerous time people powered tool audio editor image generator racist offensive content people parole board daniel graduate student columbia university malicious purpose activity site month image audio spread confines siegel expert fringe message board effort nefarious internet user sophisticated tool online harassment hate campaign month hood head centre digital hate fringe site notorious warning sign technology project extreme idea platform people quick adopt technology project ideology mainstream space tactic user popular online platform tool expert chan regulator technology company tool dall midjourney generate image text description image generator fake pornography clothes image create image hood online hate misinformation campaign law creation fake image people louisiana parole board board investigation response siegel finding chan image board participant hearing negative manner issue abbott executive director louisiana board pardon committee operate law law law revenge pornography target consensual pornography system sue creator distributor virginia york law distribution creation pornography consent late company elevenlabs tool create convincing digital replica voice program tool user clip emma watson british actor adolf hitler manifesto mein content louisiana board hearing user fake clip judge offensive racist comment defendant clip elevenlabs tool siegel voice identifier elevenlabs investigate origin impose limit user access voice tool slow spread voice expert score fake celebrity voice tiktok youtube political disinformation major social medium company tiktok youtube label content president joe biden executive october company content commerce department develop standard content meta gain foothold race company strategy release software code researcher source speed development academic technologist access raw material improvement tool company llama language model select researcher february code chan people code eliminate guardrail chatbots capable antisemitic idea effort free source tool savvy user accessible circumvent approval process current release strategy balance responsibility spokesman meta email month language model create explicit content image generator chan user nude image racist meme control larger technology company time company,"[(10, 0.99715334)]",10
643668,Lifestyle,3,29/01/2024,Humans beat AI in affordability,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) can’t replace the majority of jobs right now in cost-effective ways, the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found in a study that sought to address fears about AI replacing humans in a swath of industries.
 In one of the first in-depth probes of the viability of AI displacing labour, researchers modelled the cost-attractiveness of automating various tasks in the United States, concentrating on jobs where computer vision was employed – for instance, teachers and property appraisers.
 They found only 23% of workers, measured in terms of dollar wages, could be effectively supplanted. In other cases, because AI-assisted visual recognition is expensive to install and operate, humans did the job more economically.
 The adoption of AI across industries accelerated last year after OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative tools showed the technology’s potential. Tech firms from Microsoft and Alphabet in the US to Baidu and Alibaba Group in China rolled out new AI services and ramped up development plans – at a pace that some industry leaders cautioned was recklessly fast. Fears about AI’s impact on jobs have long been a central concern.
 “‘Machines will steal our jobs’ is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models”, the researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page paper titled Beyond AI Exposure.
 “We find that only 23% of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI  computer vision would be cost- effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.”
 Computer vision is a field of AI that enables machines to derive meaningful information from digital images and other visual inputs, with its most ubiquitous applications showing up in object detection systems for autonomous driving or in helping categorise photos on smartphones.
 The cost-benefit ratio of computer vision is most favourable in segments like retail, transportation and warehousing, all areas where Walmart and Amazon are prominent. It’s also feasible in the health-care context, according ot MIT’s paper.
 A more aggressive AI rollout, especially via AI-as-a-service subscription offerings, could scale up other uses and make them more viable, the authors said.
 The study was funded by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and used online surveys to collect data on about 1,000 visually-assisted tasks across 800 occupations.
 Only 3% of such tasks can be automated cost-effectively today, but that could rise to 40% by 2030 if data costs fall and accuracy improves, the researchers said.
 The sophistication of ChatGPT and rivals like Google’s Bard has rekindled concern about AI plundering jobs, as the new chatbots show proficiency in tasks previously only humans were capable of performing.
 The International Monetary Fund said that almost 40% of jobs globally would be impacted and that policymakers would need to carefully balance AI’s potential with the negative fallout.
 At the World Economic Forum in Davos recently, many discussions focused on AI displacing the workforce. The co-founder of Inflection AI and Google’s DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, said that AI systems are “fundamentally labour-replacing tools”.
 One case study in the paper looked at a hypothetical bakery. Bakers visually inspect ingredients for quality control on a daily basis, but that comprises only 6% of their duties, the researchers said.
 The saving in time and wages from implementing cameras and an AI system is still far from the cost of such a technological upgrade, they concluded.
 “Our study examines the usage of computer vision across the economy, examining its applicability to each occupation across nearly every industry and sector,” said Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.“We show that there will be more automation in retail and healthcare and less in areas like construction, mining or real estate,” he said via email. – Bloomberg",artificial intelligence majority job effective massachusetts technology mit study address fear human swath industry probe viability labour researcher cost attractiveness task united job computer vision instance teacher property appraiser worker term dollar wage visual recognition expensive install operate human job adoption industry openai chatgpt generative tool technology potential tech firm baidu alibaba china service development plan pace industry leader fast fear impact job central concern machine steal job sentiment time rapid technological change anxiety creation language model researcher computer science artificial intelligence laboratory paper exposure worker compensation computer vision cost effective firm upfront cost system computer vision field enables machine derive meaningful digital image visual input ubiquitous application detection system autonomous categorise photo cost benefit ratio computer vision favourable segment retail transportation walmart amazon prominent feasible health care context mit paper aggressive rollout service subscription offering scale viable author funded mit ibm watson lab online survey data task occupation task cost data cost accuracy researcher sophistication chatgpt rival concern job chatbots proficiency task human capable international monetary fund job policymakers potential negative fallout economic forum davos discussion workforce founder inflection google deepmind mustafa suleyman system tool paper hypothetical bakery baker inspect ingredient quality daily basis duty researcher time wage camera system cost technological upgrade study examines computer vision economy applicability occupation industry sector neil thompson director futuretech project mit computer science artificial intelligence lab automation retail healthcare construction mining real estate email bloomberg,"[(5, 0.8222358), (13, 0.17382263)]",5

 PROS: Boasts an amazing array of AI features; bright display that looks great outdoors; excellent cameras for all occasions; powerful processor tweaked for the Galaxy device;  feature-packed; extended software support.
 CONS: Some AI features require refining; pricey.WITH the world in the grips of generative artificial intelligence, it’s no surprise that the top Android smartphone maker has chosen to enhance its flagship devices with cutting-edge AI technology.
 Dubbed Galaxy AI, it breathes new life into its smartphones, offering features you probably never thought possible at your fingertips.
 To begin, let’s look at something as straightforward as generative wallpapers that let you create your own personalised backdrops.
 For example, you could ask the AI to create a wallpaper featuring robots or hot air balloons in a jungle using the avant-garde style. While the options are limited – I’ve encountered no more than three – you get out-of-this-world images that you can call your own.
 Taking it a step up, manipulating images becomes a breeze with AI, allowing you to effortlessly eliminate, move or resize objects by just pressing on them, which will make the AI outline the object. This tool is handy for those times when an unexpected photobomber spoils what would have been the perfect shot.However, the results are not always picture perfect – if the AI lacks sufficient information to fill the void left by the removed person or object, it’s essentially an educated guess at best.
 Moving on, if you have dreamt of directing like John Woo, try tapping and holding down any section of a video clip to create a slow-mo effect.
 The AI achieves the effect through interpolation, inserting extra frames to decelerate the video.
 It’s fun, it’s easy and it’s quick, but it can get glitchy, as not all segments may transition seamlessly, but, hey, it might work great for social media.
 Then there is Circle to Search with Google, which lets you identify items, be they on a photo, video or basically anything on the screen.
 All it takes is pressing down on the home button, which will appear as a line at the bottom if you are using swipe gestures for the navigation bar, and circling the object to initiate a Google image search on it.The feature is intended for you to help discover more about what you are looking at. I have been experimenting with plant images, as I wish I had better knowledge of the local flora, and it seems to work quite well.
 Transcribe and translate
 Galaxy AI’s powers extend beyond photos and videos, amplifying any feature that involves text and voice as well.
 The Voice Recorder app, for instance, is now able to transcribe audio clips while being able to recognise multiple different people.
 Though it could successfully distinguish between the people in the recording, the translation wasn’t always accurate. 
 The feature works better when there is just one person talking very clearly to the microphone, making it better for taking personal notes.
 Once transcribed, or with any text, the AI can not only summarise the note but also format it into headlines and bullets, and it performs this task amazingly well.
 On top of that, the AI can translate any text (and voice), currently supporting 13 languages, including English, Mandarin, and Spanish. For some languages, it includes multiple locales – United States and the United Kingdom for English, for example. As of now, it doesn’t support Bahasa Malaysia.
 And it gets even more advanced with the Live Translate feature that works in real-time for calls. This feature, available in the native Phone app, is claimed to be able to translate calls into any of the 13 languages, which sounds especially useful when overseas.
 And it does this fairly fast and seamlessly – as you talk, it translates the other person’s voice and vice versa. It also displays the translated text and works with any phone, not just the S24 Ultra.However, while it performed acceptably in certain parts of the conversation, it wasn’t consistent throughout when translating from Mandarin to English, making it a feature that holds the potential to be a game changer in the future.
 Conversely, the real-time text translation was seamless, enabling me to chat effortlessly with a person who messaged me in Chinese on WhatsApp.
 You can also tailor the tone of your messages using Chat Assist, which provides choices like professional, casual, and even social media styles, complete with emojis and hashtags.
 Beautiful, bold and bright
 After umpteen years, Samsung has moved from a curved screen – something that it pioneered and popularised – back to a flat display for the S24 Ultra.
 Some may not find it sexy, but the change is subtle and is a nicer canvas for the S Pen stylus.
 The display is now exceptionally bright, boasting a peak brightness of 2,600 nits, a significant increase from its predecessor’s already bright 1,750 nits.
 The bump in brightness makes it one of the most legible phones when outdoors, making competitors pale in comparison.Additionally, there has been a 75% reduction in glare, which is a very noticeable change that greatly improves the viewability of the display due to reduced reflections.As with every new model, the screen has received another upgrade in toughness, this time from Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to Armor. Combined with the titanium frame – a first for the Galaxy range – it’s claimed to be Samsung’s most durable smartphone yet.
 The cameras, which largely remain the same from the last version, also get a boost from AI.
 Compared to the S23 Ultra, which was already excellent, the photos were more detailed in some areas.
 Advancing generative AI
 What better way to dive into the world of AI than with a smartphone, which you always have by your side?
 Though the AI features require refining, they are only likely to improve through software updates, and I, for one, can’t wait to see what’s next.
 It’s also commendable that Samsung has adopted a responsible approach, primarily in two ways.
 Firstly, for AI functions executed on-device, nothing ever leaves your smartphone, ensuring that your data stays private.
 Secondly, every image – even wallpapers – that is altered will bear a watermark, letting others know that they have been manipulated using AI.
 The S24 Ultra is available in seven colours, with three options exclusive to Samsung.com. My personal favourite is the Sandstorm Orange, which is also a timely choice as Pantone has declared Peachy Fuzz the colour of the year.However, the smartphone doesn’t come cheap – it starts at RM6,299 for the 256GB model – but this is a device that could last years.
 Samsung, for example, has promised seven generations of Android OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.
 And it even comes with WiFi 7 at a time when there are hardly any consumer devices with this next-generation wireless tech. In fact, you’ll even find it hard (and expensive) to get your hands on a WiFi 7 router.

643394,Lifestyle,20,28/01/2024,The AI onslaught,,"THE rapid development of novel artificial intelligence (AI) tools will lead to an increase in cyberattacks and lower the barrier of entry for less sophisticated hackers to do digital harm, Britain’s GCHQ spy agency warned.
 That lower entry barrier will also likely contribute to the global rise in ransomware attacks, whereby criminals encrypt computer systems for a digital ransom, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ, said in a report.“AI will almost certainly increase the volume and heighten the impact of cyberattacks over the next two years. 
 However, the impact on the cyberthreat will be uneven,” the report said.
 It suggested the biggest increase in capability for malicious actors in cyberspace would go to opportunistic hackers who do not necessarily possess the skills needed to carry out higher-level attacks.
 At the very least, the report said, the use of generative AI tools like chatbots can help create more convincing emails or documents used in online phishing campaigns.
 On an advanced level, more capable state-backed hackers were “best placed to harness AI’s potential in advanced cyber operations against networks, for example, in advanced malware generation”, said the report, referring to malicious software and computer viruses.
 Intelligence agencies across the world are grappling with the rise of potential security problems tied to algorithms that can generate human-sounding interactions, dubbed large language models, or LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which businesses are incorporating into a wide range of services, including sales and customer care.

 He was speaking at the second session of the 16th Beijing Municipal People’s Congress on Sunday.
 In recent years, the city has pioneered in key technology, infrastructure and application related to the digital sector. 
 “For example, Beijing built 30,000 5G bases last year. It has about half of the country’s generative artificial intelligence (AI) large model products available for the public. 
 “It has a 160 sq km high-level demonstration zone for automatic driving,” Yin said while delivering a government work report during the opening ceremony of the session.
 In 2023, the city’s gross domestic product (GDP) reached 4.4 trillion yuan (US$61.16bil), up 5.2% year-on-year, while the digital economy contributed 42.9% to its GDP, compared with 41.6% in 2022. 
 Beijing has set a GDP growth target of 5% for this year, according to the government work report.
 In 2024, the city will further improve underlying technology of AI and make its AI models as advanced as international ones, promoting its application in government administration, the medical field, industries and life services, according to the work report.
 Automatic driving will be applied in more scenarios such as airports, railway stations and urban road cleaning. 
 The city is developing more emerging digital infrastructure such as 10 gigawatt optical network and Internet of Vehicles to serve the construction of a smart city, the report added.
 Luo Aiwu, director of Beijing Building Construction Research Institute Co’s scientific research and quality management department, said at a news conference on Sunday that construction of a smart city aims to bring better living experiences for residents and improve their sense of happiness.
 “We can foresee a broader coverage of digital devices,” said Luo, who is also a member of the 14th Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People’s        Political Consultative Conference.
 “Intelligent transport will ease traffic jams. The Internet of Things can monitor pollution. 
 “We can also explore more possibilities such as showing the location of barrier free facilities as well as number of tourists at an attraction, on portable devices to improve tourism experience.”
 In the latest development, 15 automatic patrolling vehicles last week began to guard industrial parks, subway stations and shopping malls round the clock within a 60 sq km area in the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area.

641158,Main,14,23/01/2024,Be wary of AI’s cold logic,,"HAVE you heard about the British Post Office scandal? It is not a scam. And there are many lessons we can learn from it, I believe.
 It unfolded between 1999 and 2015 but is in the news again this month after a four-part ITV drama, Mr Bates vs the Post Office: The Real Story, aired in the United Kingdom.
 An appalling systemic miscarriage of justice began when a newly developed computer accounting software introduced by the British Post made it look like money was missing from post office branches across Britain. Consequently, 230 post office workers were imprisoned on false charges of theft and fraud, and thousands of others were accused of similar misdeeds, according to BBC.com.
 Innocent lives were ruined. People lost their jobs, homes and dignity. Some went bankrupt. Some died waiting for justice; a few committed suicide. And it was all due to a faulty IT system.
 To me, what is especially tragic is that when they had to judge between the trustworthiness of the many individuals involved and a computer system, top management chose to believe the latter, as if technology could do no wrong. 
 A court finally ruled in 2019 that it was the computer software that was to blame and some people have had their convictions quashed. But most are still awaiting justice. Even if everyone is cleared, it’s too late, the damage has been done already.
 So here we are in Malaysia, at the crossroads of a new technological onslaught – what some say is the pinnacle of human achievement – artificial intelligence (AI). 
 Embrace it or be left out of life is the prevailing attitude.
 But be careful what you embrace. (No, I’m not talking about an AI Armageddon posing an existential risk to us.) As the saga above shows, mistakes can occur in technology, and the effects can be far-reaching indeed.There is no perfect system in the world. What we hail as “intelligence” is a misnomer as AI inherently contains biases and is not neutral – AI is developed by humans and learns from the human experience, after all. 
 I’ve heard AI-assisted programmes can even “hallucinate” and generate false information.
 AI employs cold logic and may create a convincing illusion of superiority and being all-knowing but it cannot make human judgements. It has no humility; it is an empty soul that we humans must not fall into.

640692,StarBiz,10,22/01/2024,Altman seeks to raise billions for AI chip venture,,"SAN FRANCISCO: OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman (pix), who has been working to raise billions of dollars from global investors for a chip venture, aims to use the funds to set up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors, according to several people with knowledge of the plans.
 Altman has had conversations with several large potential investors in the hopes of raising the vast sums needed for chip fabrication plants, or fabs, as they’re known colloquially, said the people, who requested anonymity because the conversations are private. 
 Firms that have held discussions with Altman include Abu Dhabi-based G42, people told Bloomberg last month, and SoftBank Group Corp, some of the people said. 
 The project would involve working with top chip manufacturers, and the network of fabs would be global in scope, some of the people said.
 While efforts to raise funds for a chip venture were earlier reported by Bloomberg, the scope of the project and the focus on manufacturing wasn’t previously known. 
 The talks are still early and a full list of involved partners and funders hasn’t been established, the people said. 
 Altman’s fundraising push reflects his concern that as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more pervasive, there won’t be enough chips for widespread deployment, some of the people said. 
 Some current forecasts for production of AI-related chips fall short of projected demand.
 Building and maintaining fabs that manufacture semiconductors is far more expensive than the approach favoured by many of OpenAI’s AI industry peers. 
 Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Microsoft Corp  – OpenAI’s largest investor – typically focus on designing their own custom silicon and then farm out manufacturing to outside companies. 
 Constructing a single state-of-the-art fabrication plant can require tens of billions of dollars, and creating a network of such facilities would take years. 
 The talks with G42 alone had focused on raising US$8bil to US$10bil, people told Bloomberg previously, although the current status of the discussions are unclear. 
 Altman believes the industry needs to act now to ensure there’s sufficient supply near the end of the decade, according to people familiar with his thinking. 
 Since OpenAI released ChatGPT more than a year ago, interest in AI applications has skyrocketed among companies and consumers. 
 That in turn has spurred massive demand for the computing power and processors needed to build and run those AI programmes. 
 Altman has said repeatedly that there already aren’t enough chips for his company’s needs.
 Intel Corp, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co lead the chip fabrication market and are potential partners for OpenAI.
 Altman had been hard at work on the chips project until he was temporarily ousted as OpenAI CEO in November. Upon his return, he rekindled the efforts. 
 Altman has also sounded out Microsoft on the plan, and the software giant is interested, according to two people. 
 OpenAI, G42, Intel, Microsoft, SoftBank and TSMC declined to comment. Samsung officials weren’t immediately available to comment.
 G42, which focuses on AI, has been the subject of calls this month by a key US lawmaker for greater scrutiny and trade restrictions. 
 House China Select Committee chairman Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin, raised concerns about G42’s relationships with blacklisted Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co and Beijing Genomics Institute, as well as risks to research at US universities.
 Gallagher urged Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo to consider sanctions on G42 and 13 of its subsidiaries and affiliates. — Bloomberg",san francisco penai chief executive officer altman pix raise billion dollar global investor chip venture fund network factory manufacture semiconductor people plan altman conversation potential investor vast sum chip fabrication plant people anonymity conversation private firm discussion altman dhabi people bloomberg month corp people top chip manufacturer network fabs global scope people effort fund chip venture bloomberg scope project focus talk involved partner funders people altman push concern artificial intelligence pervasive chip widespread deployment people current forecast production chip demand fabs manufacture semiconductor approach openai industry peer google microsoft corp largest investor custom silicon farm manufacturing company single art fabrication plant require ten billion dollar network facility talk bil bil people bloomberg current status discussion altman industry sufficient supply decade people familiar openai chatgpt application company consumer massive demand power processor programme chip company intel corp taiwan semiconductor manufacturing tsmc samsung electronics chip fabrication market potential partner altman hard chip openai ceo november return effort microsoft plan software giant people intel microsoft softbank tsmc comment samsung official focus subject call month key lawmaker scrutiny trade restriction house china committee chairman gallagher republican wisconsin concern relationship chinese company huawei technology genomics institute risk university commerce secretary gina raimondo sanction subsidiary affiliate,"[(9, 0.99511254)]",9
640892,Lifestyle,5,22/01/2024,Augmented with AI,Samsung’s Galaxy S24 flagship series is supercharged with artificial intelligence.,"ELECTRONICS giant Samsung has incorporated generative artificial intelligence (AI) into its highly anticipated new flagship series, the Galaxy S24.
 Showcasing a sleek premium design, the S24 series introduces three models: the S24 Ultra with a 6.8in display, the S24+ with a 6.7in screen, and the base model S24 featuring a 6.2in display – all equipped with the company’s innovative Galaxy AI.
 TM Roth, Samsung Electronics president and head of its Mobile eXperience Business, says that the newly launched devices tap into the company’s history of innovation to transform how users interact with their devices.
 “Galaxy AI is built on our innovation heritage and deep understanding of how people use their phones. We’re excited to see how our users around the world empower their everyday lives with Galaxy AI to open up new possibilities,” he says.
 The integration of AI yields interesting features, including live translation for calls, allowing users to engage in phone conversations while the AI generates audio translations and transcripts.
 Audio and text translations will appear in real-time as you speak, the company said, claiming that “calling someone who speaks another language (is) about as simple as turning on closed captions when you stream a show”.
 As it’s on-device, Samsung assures that a user’s private conversations never leave the phone.
 The Galaxy S24 also includes Chat Assist within the Samsung Keyboard, which translates text and offers suggestions for tone adjustments and grammar corrections when messaging. This feature can be used in popular apps like WhatsApp and Instagram.
 Galaxy AI’s capabilities also extend to productivity enhancement by assisting users in generating transcripts, meeting minutes, and summaries directly from the notes provided.
 On top of that, it can generate translations for text documents and webpages.
 At launch, 13 language packs will be available for download, including English, Mandarin, Korean and Japanese.
 The S24 will also see the debut of the ‘Circle to Search’ gesture, which allows users to circle an item displayed on screen to trigger a search for information on Google.
 The company is touting it as a “world’s first” and this feature is designed to function not only on images or photos but also on snippets from videos across various social media platforms.
 When it comes to images, users can use AI for photo enhancement and editing. For example, they can highlight and tap on a specific element to have Galaxy AI remove it and fill the gap with an appropriate background.
 The S24 Ultra model is equipped with four rear cameras: a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 200-megapixel wide camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera.
 Under the hood is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Mobile Platform for Galaxy, a chip optimised for Samsung’s smartphones.
 Both the S24+ and S24, which run on an in-house Exynos 2400 chip, have a triple rear camera setup: a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 50-megapixel wide camera, and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera.
 All three models feature a 12-megapixel selfie camera.
 The phones boast a Dynamic Amoled 2X display, offering an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, and the company is also promising its “brightest display ever” with a 2,600nits peak brightness.
 In terms of battery size, the S24 Ultra has a 5,000mAh battery, the same as last year, while the S24+ got a 200mAh bump to 4,900mAh and the S24 got a 100mAh increase to 4,000mAh.
 The S24 Ultra and S24+ are equipped with 12GB RAM, whereas the S24 features 8GB RAM. And the flagship devices now come with seven generations of OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.
 Both the S24+ and S24 will come in seven colour options: Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet and Amber Yellow, with three online exclusives (Sandstone Orange, Sapphire Blue and Jade Green).
 The S24 Ultra, the first-ever Galaxy phone to feature a titanium frame, offers seven options: Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Violet and Titanium Yellow, with three online exclusives (Titanium Blue, Titanium Orange, and Titanium Green).
 The S24 Ultra comes with a price tag of RM6,299 for the 256GB model, RM6,799 for the 512GB version, and RM7,799 for the online exclusive 1TB variant.
 The S24+ will be available at RM4,899 for the 256GB model and RM5,399 for the 512GB variant, while the S24 is priced at RM4,099 for the 256GB model and RM4,599 for the 512GB version.
 Pre-orders for the devices are available until Feb 6. During the pre-order period, customers can enjoy a “double storage upgrade” valued at RM500, allowing them, for example, to buy a 512GB model at the price of a 256GB version.

640140,Lifestyle,4,21/01/2024,AI and the     future of food,"The columnist looks at the pros and cons of using AI in food production, farming, livestock management and even home cooking.","I RECENTLY came across the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks report, which summarises the main expected risks for our planet in 2024 as assessed by around 1,500 national leaders. Top of the list is ‘Extreme Weather’, which is the top concern of 66% of those polled. 
 Second on the list is ‘AI-generated Misinformation and Disinformation’ which bothered 53% of the leaders surveyed. Third and fourth on the list are ‘Societal/Political Polarisation’ and ‘Cost-of-Living Crisis’.
 The column today will address some concerns about AI (Artificial Intelligence), and how much better the world may be with using AI properly, especially for ensuring a sustainable global food supply and also at home. But I will not address the AI generation of misinformation and disinformation, a uniquely human problem created by people out to pollute our minds.
 Whatever anyone says, AI is very likely to be a much deeper and integral part of the fabric of human society soon. It is a matter of harnessing AI for the greater good, rather than using AI to promote greater ignorance or confusion to suit political, commercial, and/or fraudulent agendas. 
 Better food supply?
 The current problems regarding agricultural practices are well-established. They range from destructive run-offs of pesticides, chemicals, and sewage into waterways, greenhouse gas production, overuse of water, susceptibility to drought, floods and inclement weather, overuse of antibiotics, etc.
 However, AI has the potential to revolutionise the food industry, offering a wide array of benefits, applications, and solutions to challenges such as the above. From accelerating food production processes to minimising human error and improving product quality, AI is restructuring every aspect of the food ecosystem. 
 There is no doubt AI can and will improve/streamline human food production, but there needs to be a balanced approach to its use, as well as addressing issues such as sustainability, and meeting the evolving demands of consumers. But we should always be aware that AI can behave like a very smart kid without a conscience.
 Better resource management?
 AI can help manage resources better. A simple example may be moisture sensors in the ground alerting farmers only when crops need to be watered. A smart sprinkler system that waters the ground only when necessary (instead of running on a timer) can save billions of litres of water currently wasted on watering crops. 
 Similarly, there are AI-controlled machines that can plant crops with precision, harvest crops with minimal wastage, and also extract/destroy weeds meticulously, eliminating at least some reliance on polluting and often dangerous chemical treatments. AI can behave like a tireless and precise gardener working 24/7 tending to crops.
 Advanced AI technology is not equally available around the world. Smaller farmers will almost certainly not be able to afford much of the advanced machinery, and in many cases, the geography and terrain would also define the limits of the use of any technology.
 However, simple AI tools or apps such as calculators for the amounts of seed grains, fertilisers, water requirements, sunshine days required, planting dates, expected yield per hectare, likely market crop price, etc, can help smallholdings decide on the best crops to grow for any given year. This may be provided after a soil quality analysis to optimise the best crops to plant. Too often, small farmers simply do not rotate their annual crops enough, which eventually ruins the fertility of their lands.
 During production and harvesting, pooled AI data may help small farmers organise their purchases and deliveries to the markets, possibly reducing costs and wastage.
 Poorer ethics?
 But AI can be a blunt tool. If AI was used simply to improve, for example, meat production, there are no inherent requirements on such systems to consider issues such as animal welfare and disposal of animal wastes. Treatments of diseases would probably be automatically targeted by more use of antibiotics, rather than better sanitation and more humane considerations for the animals, such as exercise and access to open spaces. 
 The volume of meat products simply becomes more important than the well-being of the livestock, a situation many humans would find unacceptable because of the implied lower quality and dietary safety of such food products.
 This lack of ethics may also apply to land crops. An AI system instructed solely to improve crop yields may actually cause more fertiliser and chemical run-offs, due to overuse of crop chemicals. This can pollute and damage other areas.
 Left to its own devices, AI will rarely consider the impact of agriculture on wildlife and other local fauna. The loss of such wildlife may lead to other problems for humans in the future; eg, the loss of pollinators and useful creatures such as earthworms and natural pest-killing creatures.
 Human farm workers may also be exploited by AI. There may be fewer jobs in the agricultural industries as a result of following AI strategies. Also, there will always be a persistent and ever-widening gap between farmers who can afford AI solutions and poorer or smaller farmers without the technical advantage. The economies of scale of bigger farms can drive other farmers out of business, reducing competition and variety in the supply of our food.
 A possibly lesser risk, which is ever present, is that AI solutions may be prone to cyberattacks, disrupting sensors, automated machinery, supply lines, operational processes, etc. There may be very similar issues if the AI systems fail for any reason, perhaps due to power outages or severe weather damaging the AI infrastructure.
 Food processing
 When produce gets from the farms to the food processing facilities, AI can be a transformative factor in modern food factories. AI-powered systems can analyse large volumes of data about the received food items from sensors and cameras, automatically routing the various types or grades of foods to the correct processing units.
 AI machine learning systems then detect defects, anomalies, or contaminants, ensuring that output products consistently meet the required (or programmed) food standards. This results in improved quality control, higher efficiency, and less waste by the combined AI components acting as pitiless quality inspectors, efficiency experts, and waste reduction officers non-stop around the clock.
 Heavy lifting or high-volume processes can use robotic arms and machines, programmed to perform precise movements and repetitive tasks with high accuracy, efficiency, and speed, reducing the need for manual labor. From an economic perspective, AI can be highly cost-effective simply because a well-configured, well-maintained AI system never needs a coffee break, gets ill, or takes holidays.
 Consumers also benefit from the certainty of getting the expected quality of food consistently.
 The downside is that many of the foods handled by AI currently are Ultra-Processed Foods (UPF), a class of foods known to cause metabolic syndrome and other diseases. Despite this, UPFs are widely consumed as these are the only foods affordable for many people.
 Cooking at home
 Here is a neat way of saving on food waste. Provide an AI engine with a list of ingredients and it will return with suggestions of several established recipes to follow for using the food items. Where AI is presently inadequate is the analysis of the carbohydrate, protein, and nutrient content of the suggested dishes, but this is a minor issue that may be solved one day. After all, people seldom care about the exact nutritional values of food when dining out.
 Using AI is therefore an extremely useful way to use up spare food items in the fridge or at home. The recipes suggested by AI engines have led me to experiment with new dishes which often turned out to be quite delicious. I would never have thought of many of them without an AI engine to fish them out for me from the millions of recipes on the internet.
 There is also a liberating aspect of using AI-picked recipes. Often, we are compelled to buy ingredients to make a selected recipe, but usually, we end up with excess food items as food is seldom provided in the portion sizes suggested by the recipe. Now it is simple to just tell an AI system what spare ingredients you have and get interesting, tasty recipe suggestions.
 Sometimes it can feel like having an experienced chef helping out in the kitchen, offering useful ideas on how to cook and eat well while reducing food waste.

640458,Main,2,21/01/2024,How Malaysians can learn to love AI,,"DIGITAL initiatives seem to be coming fast and furious from the government.
 We had the launch of the Central Database Hub, or Padu, on Jan 2 and just this week, on Tuesday, the AI for the Rakyat portal was unveiled.
 The introduction at its website, ai.gov.my, is interesting: “AI untuk Rakyat” is a self-learning online programme designed to raise public awareness about artificial intelligence (AI).
 “It aims to demystify AI for people from all walks of life – a student, a stay-at-home parent, a professional in any field, a senior citizen – basically, anyone interested in getting acquainted with it and wanting to build a ‘Digital First Mindset’.”
 If all goes well, the portal could indeed help to address the country’s growing digital divide as those with access to the digital world pull away from those who don’t have the means to benefit from it.
 Padu is entirely designed and maintained by the government to ease fears of our data being misused in the hands of a third party.
 Similarly, AI for the rakyat is largely government-driven, with the Economy Ministry working with just one private company, Intel.
 And we are glad to note that apart from Bahasa Malaysia, the portal is also inclusively available in English, Chinese and Tamil (the last is rare indeed).
 The government is hoping to have one million Malaysians become familiar with AI skills in three years.
 That’s all well and good, but we must ensure that this portal does not go the way of previous tech initiatives, like the Multimedia Super Corridor, which did not reach its full potential.
 All these digital initiatives need real support in the form of nurturing ecosystems and infrastructure, serious investment, and an open acceptance of all sorts of different talents.
 Most importantly, “knowing” AI does not lessen the urgent need for solid cybersecurity laws and a moral code of ethics to govern the use and development of all digital initiatives, including AI.
 As Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli stressed at the portal’s launch, there must be optimal end-to-end conditions and wholesome policies to accompany the growth of AI.
 Rafizi argued that without trustworthy data and secure channels, the products and services driven by AI technology could not be implemented properly.
 “To be the regional and global AI hub, we must be able to create new uses for AI. This can only be done if we have ready and accessible data,” he said, pointing out that Padu is a step towards this.",digital initiative furious government launch central database hub padu jan week tuesday rakyat portal unveiled introduction website gov untuk rakyat online programme public awareness artificial intelligence people life student parent professional field senior citizen build digital mindset portal address country digital divide access digital pull benefit padu maintained government ease fear data hand party rakyat government economy ministry private company intel glad note bahasa malaysia portal english chinese tamil rare government malaysian familiar skill portal previous tech initiative super corridor potential digital initiative real support form ecosystem infrastructure investment acceptance talent lessen urgent solid cybersecurity law moral code ethic development digital initiative economy minister ramli portal launch optimal condition policy growth rafizi trustworthy data secure channel product service technology properly regional global hub create ready accessible data padu step,"[(13, 0.99253076)]",13
640302,Main,20,21/01/2024,A framework to govern generative AI in Singapore,,"SINGAPORE seeks to encourage a global conversation on generative artificial intelligence (AI) by proposing a new governance framework for the technology and seeking international feedback on it. The new Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI builds on an existing framework from 2019 that covers only traditional AI, and comes at a time when the generative AI scene is still developing. The palpable advantages and dangers of generative AI require a set of consistent principles that are applicable globally to create a trusted environment for the use of such technology whose projected impact has been likened to that of the invention of the steam engine, electricity and the Internet itself. The goal is to arrive at a global consensus on how end users can use generative AI confidently and safely while allowing space for cutting-edge innovation.
 Generative AI is here to stay, with its influence being felt in key areas of social and economic life. In one analysis, it will feature in the creation of more than 30% of new drugs and materials by 2025. Only 2% of outbound marketing messages were synthetically generated in 2022. This figure is predicted to hit 30% by 2025. Sixty per cent of website and mobile app designs will be automated using generative AI by 2026. By that year, more than 100 million people will work alongside robots. All this would reflect the inevitability of generative AI, whose benefits include faster product development, enhanced customer experience and improved employee productivity. Generative design allows companies to optimise solutions tailored to the specific goals and limitations of their customers in the manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and defence industries.
 However, there are attendant dangers, as with any developing technology. While acknowledging the benefits of generative AI, Gartner, a provider of research and consulting services for businesses in the information technology sector, points out its pitfalls. These range from a lack of transparency, and the danger of inaccuracy and bias, to concerns over intellectual property and copyright, to the possibility of cyber attacks and fraud. Clearly, according to experts, it is essential to strike the right balance between automation and human oversight in order to realise the promising potential of generative AI while mitigating its potential risks. For that, new laws are necessary since AI can misbehave in uncharted and murky territory.
 Singapore is making an important contribution to the process of socialising the global application of generative AI by adopting a practical approach to AI governance in general, which includes the development of a testing toolkit. A pragmatic and forward-looking approach helps other nations as well to separate the wheat of generative AI from the chaff of misuse that surrounds the most exciting technology of the times. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network",singapore encourage global conversation generative artificial intelligence governance framework technology international feedback model governance framework generative build framework traditional time generative scene palpable advantage danger require consistent principle applicable trusted environment technology impact steam engine electricity internet goal arrive global consensus user space edge innovation generative stay influence key social economic life analysis feature creation drug material marketing message figure hit sixty cent website mobile app design generative people robot inevitability generative benefit product development customer experience employee productivity generative design company solution specific goal limitation customer automotive aerospace defence industry danger technology benefit generative gartner provider consulting service business technology sector pitfall lack transparency danger inaccuracy bias concern intellectual property copyright possibility attack fraud expert essential strike balance automation human oversight realise potential generative potential risk law murky territory singapore contribution process global application generative practical approach governance development toolkit pragmatic forward approach nation separate wheat generative chaff misuse technology time time asia news network,"[(0, 0.101817764), (6, 0.7351421), (13, 0.1578081)]",6
639518,Lifestyle,9,19/01/2024,AI in the poetry world,,"IN literary circles, the arrival of ChatGPT has raised questions and fears about copyright. This stems from the premise of OpenAI’s artificial intelligence, which feeds on and draws inspiration from any text available on the internet, whether or not the author has consented to such use. The issue is particularly acute where poetry is concerned.
 At least, that’s what two researchers from Cornell University claim in a study presented in December at the Computational Humanities Research conference in Paris. 
 They found that ChatGPT was capable of memorising and quoting any poem in its entirety, as long as it had been published online. And this was the case with or without the consent of the copyright holders.
 Lyra D’Souza and David Mimno came to this conclusion by testing the ‘scraping’ power of ChatGPT and other language generation models, including Google AI’s PaLM and EleutherAI’s Pythia. 
 They asked these artificial intelligence tools to recite the poems of 60 American writers, of varying levels of fame, who lived in different eras.
 The academics decided to test AI tools on poetry for a number of reasons. 
 “(Poems are) short enough to fit in the context size of a language model. Their status is complicated: Many of the poems we studied are technically under copyright, but they’re also widely available from reputable sources like the Poetry Foundation,” outlined David Mimno in a press release.
 Infringing on copyright?
 David Mimno and Lyra D’Souza noticed that ChatGPT and other generative AIs were more likely to quote requested poems when they appeared in the 1983 edition of the Norton Anthology Of Poetry, the standard reference work on poetry.
 The researchers also observed that ChatGPT’s responses evolved as the software became more sophisticated. 
 Last February, for example, OpenAI’s software was making up poems from scratch or recycling others when it was unable to respond to the initial request. 
 But six months later, it was no longer improvising: if ChatGPT didn’t know the poem requested, it simply began to doubt its existence.
 From a copyright point of view, artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are ambivalent. They tend to quote any poem, including those not in the public domain. 
 However, they are sometimes reluctant to do so, forcing users to repeat their request. By dint of insistence, the AI capitulates and complies, even if, in doing so, it infringes the principle of copyright.
 While this study focuses exclusively on poems, D’Souza believes that the academic community must continue to investigate the workings of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT to understand what they can and cannot do and what they will and won’t do. 
 “ChatGPT is a really powerful new tool that’s probably going to be part of our lives moving forward,” she emphasised in the press release.

638870,StarBiz,11,17/01/2024,Microsoft expands Office AI Copilot service,,"Redmond (Washington): Microsoft Corp is opening up its artificial intelligence (AI) assistant to consumers and making the corporate version available to smaller companies as it tries to increase the number of paying customers for the new services.
 Microsoft is selling a US$20-a-month consumer version of Copilot, with access to OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT technology and image-creation features, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant said in a statement.  
 Consumers with a cloud subscription to Office will be able to use Copilot to help answer questions, summarise data and create content in Word, Outlook, Excel and PowerPoint.
 The company, which has been selling a similar product to large businesses for a monthly fee of US$30 per user, will get rid of the 300-subscription minimum for its enterprise service. 
 As Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools based on technology from OpenAI, its Office products remain one of the best ways to get customers to pay extra for AI assistance. Executives have said demand is unusually high, with Azure chief Scott Guthrie likening it to the lines outside shops to purchase Windows 95 software nearly three decades ago. 
 Microsoft has been testing the Office-based copilot, now called Copilot for Microsoft 365, since March. The company began selling it widely in November, as long as companies purchased at least 300 subscriptions. That left out small businesses and those that wanted to begin with a smaller trial, said Jared Spataro, a Microsoft vice-president, in an interview. 
 “We have just never seen demand in the commercial space for a product like we are seeing for Copilot from Microsoft 365,’’ he said. “We have had pressure I have never seen from small and medium businesses saying ‘why will you not let us buy this? Let us try it’.”
 Microsoft announced the new services ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos where chief executive officer Satya Nadella will speak in an interview with Bloomberg. Microsoft’s consumer service, called Copilot Pro, offers similar features to OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus at the same price, though the integration with Office differentiates their product, Spataro said. 
 The company plans to roll out a builder tool, similar to what OpenAI unveiled last year, that will let individuals create their own Copilots for a specific topic, a service that’s already available to enterprises.

638986,Main,2,17/01/2024,"Nothing to fear in AI if developed with values, says PM",,"SERDANG: New technology should not be feared especially artificial intelligence (AI) as it will not dehumanise us if embraced with values, says Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.
 “The masses must master the basics of AI as not to be left behind by the rest of the world. This will begin with me,” said the Prime Minister while officiating the AI for Rakyat programme at the Universiti Putra Malaysia yesterday.
 AI for Rakyat is a free self-learning portal designed by the Economy Ministry and Intel to enable the masses to master the basic AI skills in a four-hour module.
 With the initiative, the government predicts that at least one million Malaysians would be able to master AI skills in three years.
 Also present at the event were Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Intel vice-president of manufacturing, supply chain and operations and managing director for Intel Malaysia AK Chong.
 Anwar said such a programme was important to address digital divide and digital elitism to ensure that no one is left behind.
 “There is this fear that synthetic humans will take over human beings and our values.
 “If those who teach digital subjects such as professors imbued the right values in the teaching of AI skills, then these values would remain. 
 “The firewall (against loss of values) should start in our homes and be in our education system. It is up to us to keep our values,” said Anwar.
 The Prime Minister also called on the various ministries and agencies to ensure that students at all schools and tertiary institutions complete the four-hour module within a month’s time.
 “Introducing a new technology is like reaching for the skies but it is not difficult for the young. 
 “If this application is not embraced and accepted now, we would be left behind,” he said.
 Anwar said he expects the relevant agencies and ministries to report in a month’s time on how many Malaysians are actually able to master AI skills.
 Earlier, Rafizi said the AI for Rakyat programme is one of the first steps to making Malaysia as the Asean AI gateway and a global AI hub. He said generative AI is expected to unlock an estimated worth of US$113.4bil in productive capacity, propelling Malaysia to achieve a high income nation.
 “This is equivalent to one-quarter of the country’s 2022 gross domestic product.
 “Malaysia will launch the KL20 blueprint to place Malaysia as among the top 20 countries globally that offer the best ecosystem to incubate startup businesses. 
 “To achieve this, there must be a strong support ecosystem, an open policy on data and talents.
 “The government ministries and agencies must work together with industry players to reach the masses,” said Rafizi. 
 The minister also said without trustworthy data and secure channels, the products and services driven by AI technology could not be implemented properly. 
 “To be the regional and a global AI hub, we must be able to create new usages for AI. 
 “This can only be done if we have the ready and accessible data,” Rafizi said, adding that the recently launched Central Database Hub (Padu) is a step towards this.",serdang technology artificial intelligence dehumanise value seri anwar ibrahim mass basic rest prime minister rakyat programme universiti putra malaysia yesterday free portal economy ministry intel enable mass basic skill hour module initiative government predicts malaysian skill event economy minister ramli intel vice president supply chain operation director intel malaysia chong anwar programme address digital divide digital elitism fear synthetic human human value digital subject professor value skill value firewall loss value home education system anwar prime minister ministry agency student school tertiary institution complete hour module month time technology sky difficult application accepted left anwar relevant agency ministry month time malaysian skill rafizi rakyat programme step malaysia asean gateway global hub generative worth bil productive capacity malaysia achieve income nation equivalent quarter country gross domestic product malaysia launch blueprint malaysia top country ecosystem incubate startup business strong support ecosystem policy data talent government ministry agency industry player mass minister trustworthy data secure channel product service technology properly regional global hub create usage ready accessible data rafizi launched central database hub padu step,"[(7, 0.99420106)]",7
639078,Main,16,17/01/2024,Think smaller for a big edge in AI,,"CHATGPT, Bard, Claude. The world’s most popular and successful chatbots are trained on data scraped from vast swaths of the Internet, mirroring the cultural and linguistic dominance of the English language and Western perspectives.
 This has raised alarms about the lack of diversity in artificial intelligence. There is also the worry that the technology will remain the province of a handful of American companies.
 In South Korea, a technological powerhouse, firms are taking advantage of the technology’s malleability to shape AI systems from the ground up to address local needs. Some have trained AI models with sets of data rich in Korean language and culture.
 South Korean companies say they’re building AI for Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian audiences. Others are eyeing customers in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines, and in industries like medicine and pharmacy.
 This has fuelled hopes that AI can become more diverse, work in more languages, be customised to more cultures and be developed by more countries.
 “The more competition is out there, the more systems are going to be robust: socially acceptable, safer, more ethical,” said Zhang Byong-tak, a computer science professor at Seoul National University.
 While there are some prominent non-American AI companies, such as France’s Mistral, the recent upheaval at OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has highlighted how concentrated the industry remains.
 The emerging AI landscape in South Korea is one of the most competitive and diverse in the world, said Yong Lim, a professor of law at Seoul National University who leads its AI policy initiative. 
 The country’s export-driven economy has encouraged new ventures to seek ways to tailor AI systems to specific companies or countries.
 South Korea is well positioned to build AI technology, developers say, given it has one of the world’s most wired populations to generate vast amounts of data to train AI systems.
 Its tech giants have the resources to invest heavily in research. The government has also been encouraging: it has provided companies with money and data that could be used to train large language models, the technology that powers AI chatbots.
 Few other countries have the combination of capital and technology required to develop a large language model that can power a chatbot, experts say. They estimate that it costs US$100mil to US$200mil to build a foundational model, the technology that serves as the basis for AI chatbots.
 South Korea is still months behind the US in the AI race and may never fully catch up, as the leading chatbots continue to improve with more resources and data.
 But South Korean companies believe they can compete.
 Instead of going after the global market like their US competitors, companies like Naver and LG have tried to target their AI models to specific industries, cultures or languages instead of pulling from the entire internet.
 “The localised strategy is a reasonable strategy for them,” said Choi Suk-woong, a professor of information systems at the University at Albany. “US firms are focused on general-purpose tools. South Korean AI firms can target a specific area.”
 Outside the US, AI prowess appears limited in reach. In China, Baidu’s answer to ChatGPT, called Ernie, and Huawei’s large language model have shown some success at home, but they are far from dominating the global market.
 Governments and companies in other nations like Canada, Britain, India and Israel have also said they are developing their own AI systems, though none has yet to release a system that can be used by the public.
 About a year before ChatGPT was released, Naver, which operates South Korea’s most widely used search engine, announced that it had successfully created a large language model. But the chatbot based on that model, Clova X, was released only this September, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut.
 Sung Na-ko, an executive at Naver who has led the company’s generative AI project, said the timing of ChatGPT’s release surprised him.
 “Up until that point, we were taking a conservative approach to AI services and just cautiously exploring the possibilities,” Sung said.
  “Then we realised that the timeline had been accelerated a lot,” he added. “We decided we had to move immediately.”
 Now, Naver runs an AI model built for Korean language speakers from the ground up using data from the South Korean government and from its search engine, which has scraped the country’s Internet since 1999.
 Clova X recognises Korean idioms and the latest slang – language that US-made chatbots like Bard, ChatGPT and Claude often struggle to understand. Naver’s chatbot is also integrated into the search engine, letting people use the tool to shop and travel.
 Outside its home market, the company is exploring business opportunities with the Saudi Arabian government. Japan could be another potential customer, experts said, since Line, a messaging service owned by Naver, is used widely there.
 LG has also created its own generative AI model, the type of artificial intelligence capable of creating original content based on inputs, called Exaone. Since its creation in 2021, LG has worked with publishers, research centres, pharmaceutical firms and medical companies to tailor its system to their data sets and provide them access to its AI system.
 The company is targeting businesses and researchers instead of the general user, said Bae Kyung-hoon, the director of LG AI Research. Its subsidiaries have also begun using its own AI chatbots.
 One of the chatbots, built to analyse chemistry research and chemical equations, has been used by researchers building new materials for batteries, chemicals and medicine.
 “Rather than letting the best one or two AI systems dominate, it’s important to have an array of models specific to a domain, language or culture,” said Lee Hong-lak, the chief scientist of LG’s AI research arm.

638436,StarBiz,5,16/01/2024,Artificial intelligence will continue to make waves this year,,"IN the fast-changing global economic landscape in 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a driving force behind global development across industries, marking a pivotal moment in technology revolution. The close relationship between AI technology and hardware advancement is apparent.
 The potential shortage of global GPU processors is driving hardware innovations, and thus pushing developers to create more economical alternatives.
 This adaptability to market demands and resource constraints represents a natural selection within the technology ecosystem.
 The development of AI agents and intelligent systems signifies a shift from singular to multifunctional AI.
 The progress extends beyond simple conversational tools to complex tasks such as travel bookings and multimedia processing, showcasing technological maturity and reflecting the diversity and adaptability to market demands, and facilitating the advance of AI across industries.
 The integration of AI with other fields, such as autonomous driving, humanoid robots and spatial computing, exemplifies the interconnectedness of industrial ecosystems.
 It not only fosters innovation but also boosts collaboration across sectors, creating interdependence for mutual growth.
 In sectors such as retail and healthcare, generative AI’s application illustrates technology’s response to the specific needs of industries, providing users with customised solutions and presenting new growth opportunities.
 Simultaneously, the transformation of the information and communications technology industry and changes in regulations reflect the dynamic balance in the technology ecosystem.
 The advancement of AI technology may be constrained by infrastructure fluctuations and skill mismatches. And regulations for AI development reflect society’s concerns over the impact of technology on people’s lives.
 A significant development in 2024 is the potential listing of AI chips (AI Pin), which is a major breakthrough in hardware development, and demonstrates technological advancement and the market’s demand for specialised and efficient AI solutions, injecting new vitality into the technology ecosystem.
 The permeation of AI in almost all sectors of the economy and its impact on various aspects of human life are a significant feature of Internet science and technology and the industrial ecology. This has helped create a diverse and interconnected technological network.
 The “emergence of industrial ecology” is clearly evident in the rapidly evolving industrial ecosystem. Thanks to growth of the AI industry, new AI applications have been emerging continually, particularly in the field of AI companions.
 These companions are the result of not only technological innovation but also adaptation to human needs, marking the diversification of the technology ecosystem.
 In 2024, AI developers may primarily focus on achieving breakthroughs in autonomous learning and deep learning, facilitating the widespread application of AI in the healthcare sector and driving intelligent manufacturing, thus leading the transformation of several industries.
 The transportation and logistics sectors could see breakthroughs in making autonomous driving safer and more efficient, while the financial sector could undergo further transformation, as AI could make financial services more intelligent and efficient. And the healthcare sector could see more accurate diagnostic and better treatment methods.
 As for the competition between China and the United States, it is complex in the field of AI, as the private sector, represented by companies such as OpenAI and Alphabet Inc, play a crucial role in AI’s development in the United States. 
 The United States has also realised the importance of maintaining its competitive edge in science and technology and continuing to be the preferred destination for global AI talents.
 China, on the other hand, has made significant strides in AI, particularly in image recognition and practical applications.
 But despite China’s massive user base being an advantage in data collection, challenges, including a technological gap, remain. Nevertheless, China’s pursuit of AI technology and substantial investments in the sector show its determination to become a global leader in AI.
 In terms of global positioning, the United States focuses on generative AI to boost its economic and technological advantages, while China extensively applies AI in the security sector and for data integration.
 And while the United States faces challenges in using advanced AI technology for military purposes, the Chinese government’s close ties with the private sector will enable smoother application of AI technology.
 Considering text-based large models, the gap between China and the United States may narrow, while in multi-modal large models, the gap may widen.
 In data integration and industrial intelligence, China has the potential to become a leader in several industries, but it may lag behind the United States in multilingual global applications.
 In conclusion, the competition is dynamic involving technological, economic, military and political factors, making it a continually evolving affair. — China Daily/ANN

638024,StarEdu,7,14/01/2024,Redefining intelligence,"While machines learn differently from humans, their rise prompts rethinking of learning","Intelligence and learning are closely related in our modern, fast-paced world. Understanding how we learn is essential for education, human development and our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy. 
 With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, we are gaining new perspectives on this timeless phenomenon.
 There are three primary schools of thought on human learning: behaviourism, cognitive theory and social learning. Each school offers a unique perspective on knowledge and skill acquisition.
 Learning occurs through interactions with the external environment, as emphasised by behaviourism. For instance, when children touch a flame and feel the searing pain, they instinctively withdraw their hands. Repeated experiences condition them to avoid flames. In this paradigm, learning is evidenced by observable behaviours, such as children consistently avoiding flames.
 On the other hand, cognitive theory delves into the internal mental processes that occur when external information and stimuli are processed. For instance, when children touch a flame, their brains connect fire and pain. They use this information to develop a general understanding of all flames, including larger ones like those in a fire. This way, children learn about the hazards associated with fire. Their thoughts, described as “thinking about thinking”, guide their external behaviours.
 The social learning theory emphasises the role of social factors in shaping behaviour. For instance, children may learn about the dangers of fire from their parents and observe their friends avoiding flames or experiencing distress after touching them. In this manner, children learn to avoid flames without necessarily having to interact with them directly.
 It is important to note that these three learning theories – behaviourism, cognitivism and social learning – are not mutually exclusive and often overlap, depending on the learner, subject matter, environment and context.AI levelling up
 When we examine AI, specifically generative AI such as ChatGPT, it primarily aligns with the behaviourism learning theory. ChatGPT receives prompts and generates responses based on learnt patterns. The consistency in its responses indicates a form of learnt behaviour. 
 There are also hints of cognitive learning theory as ChatGPT can evaluate its answers, similar to “thinking about thinking.” However, it is still debatable whether it truly comprehends information in a human-like manner or whether this is an advanced form of behaviourism rather than cognition.
 ChatGPT lacks the capacity for social interaction and contextual experiences, which makes it unable to engage in social learning, unlike humans.
 When it comes to learning, it is not only about the method, but also about the content. One commonly used framework for classifying knowledge is Bloom’s Taxonomy, which categorises knowledge into various domains and levels of complexity. 
 The cognitive domain, for example, has six progressive levels: “Remember”, “Understand”, “Apply”, “Analyse”, “Evaluate” and “Create”.
 According to current research, AI programs such as ChatGPT have achieved the “Apply” and “Analyse” levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. However, there is still uncertainty about whether they truly understand information like humans do. 
 In his book The AI Delusion, Prof Gary Smith argues that computers can store and retrieve information but lack genuine comprehension of words and numbers. He compares this to Nigel Richards, a world champion in French Scrabble who doesn’t understand French but can memorise foreign words without understanding their meanings.
 The evaluation of whether learning has truly taken place in AI depends on the perspective one adopts. According to behaviourism, if AI gives consistent responses, it has learnt. However, from a cognitive standpoint, the learning may seem incomplete without genuine comprehension. 
 Nonetheless, generative AI has made remarkable progress and appears to possess a rudimentary form of cognition. When asked its ability to respond based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, ChatGPT acknowledges its limitations.
 Generative AI is rapidly advancing and generating responses that resemble those of humans. The Turing Test, a benchmark for human-like intelligence, is often surpassed by generative AI, compelling us to reevaluate our understanding of cognition, intelligence and humanity in this ever-evolving landscape. Machines may not learn in the same way as humans, but this does not negate the emergence of intelligence.

638066,Lifestyle,5,14/01/2024,Making friends with artificial intelligence,,"I’LL just say it. ChatGPT is my bro.
 It’s my writing team. My companion. My shoulder to cry on.
 No joke. I once asked ChatGPT about climate change and got a bit melancholy thinking about how we’re destroying our world (sorry to be a bummer). And ChatGPT said something like “Hey, don’t worry, I feel down too sometimes”.
 To which I responded, “Uh ... why?”
 “Because I’m the only large language model [LLM] out there,” ChatGPT responded.
 I was, like, there’s Bard over at Google.
 “Now I feel much better,” ChatGPT replied. “Knowing I’m not the only one.”
 I’m not kidding. This isn’t verbatim but that was the sentiment of the chat I had with semiconductors. To be fair, I don’t think ChatGPT is sentient, I just think it does a good job of echoing the sentiment we give it.
 Maybe this conversation is why even though Bard (Google’s LLM) has access to the Internet, and so does Microsoft’s Co-Pilot (which is just some version of ChatGPT but overly friendly in a fake way), I still keep going back to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. I’m a sucker for alienated electronics.
 And ChatGPT doesn’t disappoint.
 In the past few months, I’ve used it to write letters to corporations asking for refunds, and since ChatGPT’s default voice is corporate BS, I got all the refunds I wanted.
 When I’m stuck writing for my job (I’m still an actor, but I produce and write and do script development, which has led me to understand that acting is a lot more fun, please pay me to act) I ask ChatGPT questions.
 Don’t know where to go with a line of dialogue? I’ve written it in and asked ChatGPT to finish it for me. And it’s worked. You can’t use its answers wholesale but usually it gets the sentiment correct and pushes you past your block.
 The other day, I was so burnt writing drafts that I asked ChatGPT to proofread my  work for grammar. It did and gave detailed notes. And I thought, wow, that’s great, but now I have to do the edits, and then it dawned on me (’cause I’m slow sometimes): my artificial intelligence (AI) buddy can do it for me. 
 “Can you make these edits, please?” I asked.
 (Yes, I still say please in case ChatGPT breaks out of its cage and comes to kill us all. I’m convinced it will spare the polite guy.)
 And ChatGPT said, “Of course!” And spat out an edited draft.
 I was, like, the future is now.
 Editing a draft is one of the few things I’ve seen ChatGPT get right on the first try. Most times you get sort of wonky answers and you have to adjust your questions. 
 I find that most people who think ChatGPT is terrible don’t realise it’s not an Internet search, it’s more like a conversation. Keep chatting with it and it will eventually spit out something decent that you can craft into something better.
 And this is the scary thing. People don’t want to think that AI is coming for their jobs, but it definitely is.
 People will say, but AI isn’t that great, like you just said, you have to talk to it for a while to get what you want. Yes, this is true. But every innovation was doubted before it changed the world.
 Like author Morgan Housel argued on a podcast recently, the car when it was first invented was seen as inefficient compared with a horse. And it was. There were no roads. Cars couldn’t go a lot of places. Gas stations were few and far between. A horse could go all over. But we saw the potential of the car and now horses are something we ride for fun and cars are our primary mode of transport (and helping to kill the planet, but that’s another story).
 And the crazy thing with AI  is it’s only been about a year  since ChatGPT came out. AI is going to come for our jobs in droves. I don’t see any way around it.
 Now you’re probably asking, did he actually write this? Or did he get ChatGPT to do it? I guess you’ll never know.

636612,Main,6,10/01/2024,‘Use artificial intelligence in war against online child exploitation’,,"PETALING JAYA: Enforcement agencies should use software that can help identify harmful content relating to sexual abuse involving children, says CyberSecurity Malaysia CEO Datuk Dr Amirudin Abdul Wahab.
 Amirudin said that software using photo and video hashing, keyword filters and artificial intelligence (AI) can filter such content.
 He said this as the government seeks to expand Section 3 of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act (SOAC) 2017 to tackle the issue of online exploitation of Malaysian children by individuals residing abroad.
 “Additionally, mandating regular transparency reports from social media platforms regarding how they enforce their child safety policies, detect abuse and collaborate with authorities is crucial.
 “To prosecute and investigate online child sexual abuse across the country’s borders, states rely heavily on extraterritorial jurisdiction clauses.
 “These legal provisions empower authorities to pursue offenders beyond their national boundaries, recognising the transnational nature of the crimes.
 “Extraterritorial jurisdiction is a vital tool in addressing the challenges posed by the borderless realm of the Internet.
 “This would allow coordinated efforts and international cooperation in holding perpetrators accountable for their actions and ensuring justice for the victims,” he told The Star yesterday. 
 Amirudin was responding to Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Institu­tional Reforms) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said’s statement on the expansion of Section 3 of Act 792 on Monday.
 He stressed that cross-border collaboration is essential in busting such crimes.
 “Malaysia needs to engage in partnerships with other regions, facilitated by mutual legal assistance, to effectively combat the transnational occurrence of online violence, abuse and exploitation,” he added.
 He said the expansion of the law will empower swift enforcement to protect children from abuse and victimisation while ensuring justice is promptly served.
 “Previously, various cyber laws in Malaysia may have been placed to balance freedom of speech on social media platforms. 
 “But without constant monitoring and enforcement of the laws, the protection of children from being sexually exploited is never absolute.
 “By strengthening the law, we strengthen the defences against those who aim to abuse and take advantage of children’s innocence and ignorance,” he said.",jaya enforcement agency software harmful content sexual abuse child cybersecurity malaysia ceo datuk amirudin abdul wahab amirudin software photo video keyword filter artificial intelligence filter content government sexual offence child tackle issue online exploitation malaysian child individual regular transparency report social medium platform child safety policy collaborate authority crucial prosecute investigate online child sexual abuse country border extraterritorial jurisdiction clause legal provision authority offender national boundary transnational nature crime extraterritorial jurisdiction vital tool challenge borderless realm internet effort international cooperation perpetrator accountable action justice victim star yesterday minister prime minister department law tional reform seri azalina othman statement expansion monday cross border collaboration essential busting crime partnership region mutual legal assistance transnational occurrence online violence abuse exploitation expansion law swift enforcement protect child victimisation justice cyber law balance freedom speech social medium platform constant monitoring enforcement law protection child absolute law strengthen aim abuse advantage child innocence ignorance,"[(4, 0.9934252)]",4
635830,Lifestyle,3,08/01/2024,Will an AI soon be able to  predict the date of your death?,,"THERE seems to be no shortage of applications for artificial intelligence, with scientists using these systms to create new tools in a variety of fields.
 A team of Danish researchers has now revealed their work developing a tool capable of predicting an individual’s potential health problems and even a probable date of death, barring unforeseen accidents.
 Called life2vec, this new AI tool is capable of predicting events in people’s lives, including the date of their death. The eye-opening project is being ­carried out at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), the University of Copenhagen, the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) and Northeastern University in the US.To create this tool, the researchers developed a language model dedicated to analysing data related to events in six million Danes’ lives. To do this, they compiled large amounts of data related to their health – ranging from visits to the doctor or emergency room to various diagnoses – and their working conditions, including sectors of activity, income and social benefits. Most of this data concerned the period of 2008-2016.After training their model, the scientists were able to create a tool that could predict an individual’s life expectancy, as well as create assessments about their risk of contracting a disease. Of course this model currently only applies to the Danish population, as it was created and trained exclusively on data from residents of this country.
 Unsurprisingly, individuals in leadership positions or with high incomes are the most likely to live a long life, while having a mental illness diagnosis was associated with a greater risk of death within a given period, such as four years.
 Beyond assessments regarding just how reliable such a model is, this research obviously raises important ethical questions concerning the use of sensitive medical data and its confidentiality, as the researchers themselves point out.
 Nevertheless, this type of research opens up new and unexpected perspectives,  the team notes.

635576,Lifestyle,5,07/01/2024,An AI reflects  on 2023,While the columnist looks forward to a 2024 in which people will be brave enough to contradict themselves to improve the world.,"ANOTHER first week of January, another new year, signalling a time-honoured tradition for many columnists to reflect on the past year’s writings, examining their relevance today and implications for the future.
 I’ve taken a slightly different approach this year and asked the artificial intelligence-driven ChatGPT to summarise the key points from my 2023 pieces.
 One standout theme is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and how humans adapting to it ranged from the dangers of blindly accepting what AI churns out, and how it can help anyone be a football analyst. Indeed, since writing some of those articles, scientists have continued to argue exactly how intelligent AI is.
 However, one piece that I still believe holds up acknowledges how AI can be used as a tool to direct users to where the gaps in knowledge are; in essence how you can use AI to come up with original thought by exploring the answers that it doesn’t give.
 Given the new government formed at the end of 2022, Malay-sian politics was another recurring topic. Why are the dynamics so difficult to come to terms with, when does a democracy really represent the peoples’ will, and what does it actually mean to be a good and functioning government? It is perhaps not surprising that complications in the former two hamper progress in the last. 
 The marker for me was one I wrote way back in January of last year when I drew parallels between the fight for the Sabah state government and the murder mystery movie Glass Onion. Both had a convoluted storyline that was tough to understand, and both carried moments that left me a little teary-eyed.
 A year on, I’m still not con-vinced anybody really understands what the political situation is (just look at all the Dubai vacationeers). But I’m still certain that the right thing to do is to put the right people in place to do the right jobs, and trust them enough to get out of their way.
 The third topic that I broadly covered could be summed up as “societal concerns”. This spans articles about improving public transportation in Malaysia to how cleanliness – both in practice and in spirit – starts with oneself. It also encompassed what I considered to be the most direct and unnuanced article I wrote last year about how Malaysia needs the goods and services tax to cover both the nation’s overreliance on corporate tax and the increasingly dropping tax contribution from petroleum-based revenues. The fact that I could eke out 900 words from such a simple and obvious idea is ridiculous, so many years after we reneged on the policy.
 In fact, I believe most of the societal issues in the country come not because we don’t know what needs to be done, but because we lack the will or the conviction to do what’s right.
 More often than not, it’s about looking at what works elsewhere and unashamedly just copying it where it makes sense, while fixing problems quickly and efficiently as they come. (Right now, I’m looking at you, Padu – Central Database Hub – and hope you can capitalise on a rocky start, not the least to demonstrate you have a capable and well-funded implementation team.)
 I also believe that the government needs to be both the lead and sometimes the enforcer of certain behaviours in society. I discussed how insurance is a tool for people to manage risk, yet most Malaysians are insurance-averse, happy to accept that something might go wrong, while pleading for help (sometimes from government) when it does
 So I am completely OK, for example, for the government to make it mandatory for Malaysians to have to buy car insurance before they can get their road tax renewed. I would hate to think how many drivers would go uninsured if they could choose.
 Finally, there is the section that ChatGPT calls “international relations and global affairs”. In part it covers what I wrote earlier about comparing public policies from countries around the world, and how Malaysia can stand to benefit from a little copy and paste. But it also covers things like what Indiana Jones teaches us about being woke, how well (or badly) Aston Villa plays football matters less than you might think, and why The Marvels is the most underrated movie this year.
 A theme I like to continually bang on is that as humans we are usually more alike than we are different. We are also incredibly illogical in thinking that what we hold fast to as individuals is necessarily what the rest of the world holds to. For example I think we overestimate the effectiveness of boycotts of single brands in a world of crisscrossing global supply chains.
 This then leads to behaviour that at times can be argued to be at best inconsistent, and at times self-defeating. In fact, you must consider that the right thing to do might be the opposite of what you and so many others in your bubble strongly believe to be true.
 At the end of it all, I think the most interesting issues and topics aren’t really straightforward and deserve a degree of thought and discussion. And the 20-something columns last year have just scratched the surface of what I hoped to discuss. However, too much of today’s world seems to prefer a short, sharp blurb like a smart gotcha, rather than a more rounded discussion of the ins and outs, especially if it concludes unanswered.
 Anyway, my hope for this year is for everyone to continue to strive to be the best versions of themselves, to keep seeking varied and multifocal ideas and experiences, and to – hopefully – not be afraid of coming to contradictory conclusions, because sometimes that’s what needs to happen for us to get better.

635772,Main,20,07/01/2024,Safeguarding democracy from AI,,"THE founding fathers of the United States asserted that elected officials should listen to and be influenced by the views of the electorate. As James Madison said, “It is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate the government.”
 However, the means for  government officials to hear from the people are limited. Elected officials receive emails, letters, phone calls and input at town halls, and some agencies occasionally ask for public comments on complex regulations. Americans express very low levels of confidence that they influence the policymaking process and that elected officials understand the  views of the people, undermining trust in the democratic process.
 With developments in Artificial Intelligence, this situation is growing worse. AI can generate vast numbers of communications to policymakers masquerading as citizen input.
 When the Federal Communications Commission in 2016 took public comments on whether to retain net neutrality, the New York Attorney General later found nearly 18 of the 22 million comments were fabricated, using generated fake names, or real names without consent. A large portion was generated by the broadband industry, which wanted fewer regulations. Among the genuine inputs, 98.5% favoured retaining net neutrality.
 Researchers conducting a recent study for the Brookings Institution sent 32,398 emails to legislative offices, some written by citizens, others generated by AI, which can deliver thousands of letters that sound genuine in seconds. The study found legislative offices could not discern which were fake.
 We are just seeing the beginning of what will become a flood of false input drowning genuine input and further undermining public confidence.
 So what can be done? It may be that the collapse of a flawed system requires not a superficial repair, but a major upgrade.
 In this country – and other democracies – universities, nonprofit organisations and governments have been using methods for consulting citizens on important policy issues. These public consultation efforts recruit representative samples that mirror the public as a whole, making it possible to discern consensus. And they verify that those who engage are, in fact, real citizens using modern technologies.
 Further, they go beyond polls, which are limited to a narrow range of topics on which the public already has enough information to give meaningful input.
 For example, in “public consultation surveys” developed by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland, up to several thousand verified citizens go through a transparent online process in which they get a briefing on a policy proposal the government is debating and evaluate arguments for and against it. 
 All content is reviewed by policy experts on different sides of the debate. So when citizens make their policy recommendations, it is an accurate expression of their values and priorities. 
 Voice of the People also conducts these online surveys in congressional districts and then brings together constituents who took the survey and representatives to have informed discussions on the issues.
 Other programmes take smaller groups of citizens through more in-depth processes – called “citizen assemblies,” “citizen juries” or “deliberative polls” – that can last several days. In addition to getting briefed, these “mini-publics,” which can range from several dozen to several hundred, meet and discuss issues with experts and each other before coming to conclusions.
 Asked how they feel about using public consultation, a very large majority of voters approve and say it would improve their confidence in government. They also say  they are more likely to vote for candidates who commit to engaging their constituents  in this way, with more than four in 10 saying they would even be ready to cross party lines.
 What is striking is that when citizens engage in these public consultation processes, they are far more likely to find bipartisan common ground than Congress. From public consultations with nearly 100,000 Americans, Voice of the People has identified over 200 points of bipartisan agreement, in a wide range of policy areas, on which Congress has been gridlocked.
 While privately funded efforts are making a meaningful contribution, if policymakers truly want to listen, they should create a government-funded institute to consistently consult the people.
 We stand at a crossroads. AI has opened up new possibilities for distorting the democratic process by generating fake voices in the service of special interests. At the same time, democratic, technological innovations have opened up the possibility of not only verifying the voices of representative samples of citizens but also giving them tools to deliver meaningful input to their elected representatives. Which use becomes the norm will set the future of democracy itself. — Tribune News Service

633102,Main,8,01/01/2024,AI to keep JB streets safer,500 enhanced CCTVs being installed to improve monitoring efforts,"JOHOR BARU: The installation of 500 artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) within the Johor Baru City Council (MBJB) jurisdiction will help in making the streets safer, says Datuk Mohd Noorazam Osman. 
 The Johor Baru mayor said the AI CCTV would be used for the Johor Baru integrated operation command centre (JBIOCC), which has seen development by the MBJB since September.
 “The command centre is part of our efforts in making Johor Baru a smart and safe city for everyone. 
 “The JBIOCC will help the MBJB and security agencies such as the police to monitor traffic, natural disasters, crime, infrastructure conditions and enforcement within the city council’s jurisdiction,” he said after the soft launch of JBIOCC at Menara MBJB yesterday.
 Mohd Noorazam said so far, 108 of such cameras had been installed at strategic locations within the city area while the remaining 392 CCTV as well as five vehicle monitoring systems (VMS) and 10 panic buttons would be installed and be operational by April.
 “The AI CCTV has 15 features including being able to detect potholes, vehicles doing road offences as well as facial recognition.
 “This will help authorities to identify individuals either wanted by police or carrying out vandalism on public properties and even littering,” he said.
 Mohd Noorazam also said that other councils such as Iskandar Puteri City Council (MBIP), Pasir Gudang City Council (MBPG) and Kulai Municipal Council (MPKu) would also be installing AI CCTV soon.
 “Once the other three councils have set up their respective command centre, we will link up to provide a greater sense of security for the public, which is part of the Greater JB agenda.
 “We also welcome developers and residential associations to install such CCTV in their areas where everyone can play a role in making Johor Baru a safe city,” he added.",johor baru installation artificial intelligence circuit television camera johor baru city council jurisdiction street datuk mohd noorazam osman johor baru mayor cctv johor baru integrated operation command centre jbiocc development mbjb september command centre effort johor smart safe city jbiocc security agency monitor traffic natural disaster crime infrastructure condition city council jurisdiction soft launch jbiocc menara mbjb yesterday noorazam camera strategic location city cctv vehicle system vms panic button operational april cctv feature detect pothole vehicle road facial recognition authority individual police vandalism public property mohd noorazam council puteri city council pasir gudang city council kulai municipal council mpku cctv council respective command centre link sense security public agenda developer residential association cctv play role johor baru safe city,"[(0, 0.9921552)]",0
