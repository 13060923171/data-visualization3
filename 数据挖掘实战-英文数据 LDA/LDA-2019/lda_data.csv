89409,StarBiz,14,23/12/2019,Think tank: China should step up regulation of AI in finance,,"BEIJING: China should introduce a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence in the finance industry, and enhance technology used by regulators to strengthen industry-wide supervision, policy advisers at a leading think tank said yesterday.
“We should not deify artificial intelligence as it could go wrong just like any other technology,” said the former chief of China’s securities regulator, Xiao Gang, who is now a senior researcher at the China Finance 40 Forum.
“The point is how we make sure it is safe for use and include it with proper supervision,” Xiao told a forum in Qingdao on China’s east coast.
Technology to regulate intelligent finance – referring to banking, securities and other financial products that employ technology such as facial recognition and big-data analysis to improve sales and investment returns – has largely lagged development, showed a report from the China Finance 40 Forum.
Evaluation of emerging technologies and industry-wide contingency plans should be fully considered, while authorities should draft laws and regulations on privacy protection and data security, the report showed.
Lessons should be learned from the boom and bust of the online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending sector where regulations were not introduced quickly enough, said economics professor Huang Yiping at the National School of Development of Peking University.
China’s P2P industry was once widely seen as an important source of credit, but has lately been undermined by pyramid-scheme scandals and absent bosses, sparking public anger as well as a broader government crackdown.
“Changes have to be made among policy makers,” said Zhang Chenghui, chief of the finance research bureau at the Development Research Institute of the State Council. — Reuters",china introduce regulatory framework artificial intelligence finance industry enhance technology regulator industry wide supervision policy adviser tank yesterday artificial intelligence wrong technology chief china security regulator gang senior researcher china finance forum safe proper supervision xiao forum qingdao china east coast technology regulate intelligent finance banking security financial product technology facial recognition data analysis sale investment return development report finance forum evaluation technology industry wide contingency plan authority law regulation privacy protection data security report lesson boom bust online peer lending sector regulation economics professor huang national school development university china industry source credit pyramid scheme scandal absent boss public anger government crackdown policy maker chenghui chief finance bureau development institute council reuters,"[(0, 0.4662515), (3, 0.52839035)]",3
87317,StarBiz,5,18/12/2019,Son makes a pitch for Japan-led Asia AI superpower,,"TOKYO: SoftBank Group Corp founder Masayoshi Son has a solution to Japan’s decades-long economic malaise. Not surprisingly, it involves artificial intelligence (AI).
Japan can boost growth by joining with India and South-East Asian countries in creating a common AI platform, Son told scientists and government bureaucrats who gathered in Tokyo yesterday for the government’s Moonshot symposium. He envisions Japan taking a leading role and believes the combined populations and markets could give the countries a fighting chance against the behemoths of China and the United States, which share the lead in AI, he said.
“This is the moonshot,” Son said, drawing laughter with a slide that showed a graph of Japanese gross domestic product climbing steeply to exceed those of China and the United States. “If we can achieve this, the result will be amazing.”
As the first country to confront intractable problems of an ageing society, Japan should focus on autonomous driving and DNA-centric medicine as solutions to rising traffic accidents involving the elderly and soaring medical costs, Son said. South-East Asian countries should join Japan in creating a shared data bank and developing an “AI engine”, he said. Son didn’t explain what he meant by that nor say why developing countries would want to help the wealthy neighbour with its first-world problems.
“If we create Asia’s number one platform, that is a big potential,” Son said.
While many venture capitalists view Son’s sermons about the coming AI age as nothing more than marketing, the billionaire is already pushing his own companies to prepare for the future where every industry is redefined by the technology. Last month, SoftBank announced plans to combine its Yahoo Japan Internet business with Line Corp, Japan’s biggest messaging service. The complex deal on his home turf is supposed to create a national champion that can more effectively compete with global rivals like Google and Amazon.com Inc.
Son is as bullish as ever on AI even as his investment strategy has come under fire. SoftBank’s Vision Fund had to write down the value of its ride-hailing portfolio, which includes China’s Didi Chuxing Inc, India’s Ola and Singapore’s Grab Holdings Ltd after Uber Technologies Inc fell more than 30% following its listing in May. Son also lost billions of dollars after pouring money into WeWork, a company that has no discernible AI technology but plenty of hurdles as it tries to turn a profit.
The hype around self-driving cars has died down recently after a number of deadly crashes in cars on AI autopilot made it clear that true autonomy may be many years away. Still, Son said robotaxis can already do better than senior citizens. He played a video of an autonomous vehicle from Cruise, a General Motors Co self-driving unit where SoftBank has invested US$2.25bil, navigating San Francisco’s crowded streets.
“If you are still doubting the capability of autonomous driving, this is already today,” he said. — Bloomberg",tokyo corp founder masayoshi son solution japan decade economic malaise artificial intelligence japan boost growth india south east asian country common platform son scientist government bureaucrat tokyo yesterday government symposium envisions role combined population market country chance behemoth china share lead moonshot son laughter slide japanese gross domestic product steeply exceed china united achieve result amazing country confront intractable society japan autonomous dna centric medicine solution traffic accident elderly medical cost south east asian country japan data bank engine son meant country neighbour create asia platform potential son venture capitalist son sermon age marketing billionaire company future industry technology month plan japan internet business corp japan biggest service complex deal turf create national champion compete global rival amazon son bullish investment strategy fire softbank vision fund ride portfolio china didi india ola singapore grab holding uber technology son billion dollar money wework company discernible technology plenty hurdle hype driving car deadly crash car true autonomy son robotaxis senior citizen video autonomous vehicle cruise motor unit softbank bil san francisco street capability autonomous bloomberg,"[(2, 0.76121837), (3, 0.23493725)]",2
87431,Main,21,18/12/2019,AI Robot to stop online fraudsters,Service will warn potential victims of suspicious activity via voice and text,"BEIJING: An artificial intelligence service designed to prevent people from being defrauded was unveiled after a successful pilot programme.Called the AI Robot, the online service –released by the criminal investigation bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and designed by internet giant Alibaba – can warn residents about suspicious online activity through its voice or text system.
For example, if police detect that a phone number is frequently used by con artists, the service will call potential victims, warning them that information they received about money transfers is fraudulent. According to the bureau, people can see a special anti-fraud number for the police on their phone.
“The AI technology can help us save manpower and improve our work efficiency, and it can also keep people out of fraud traps more quickly than we can,” said Liu Zhongyi, the bureau’s head.
The service has successfully aided police in preventing more than 3,000 people each day from being swindled since the pilot programme was launched in some public security bureaus on Nov 15, Liu said.
The service has been extended across the country since Monday.
“If residents ignore the robot’s warning or do not believe the robot, we’ll call the potential victims via our telephone number to save them from the fraud,” said Zhao Wei, a police officer from an anti-fraud centre under the Beijing Public Security Bureau.
As for those likely tricked by swindlers, Zhao said she and her colleagues would talk to them or help them face-to-face.
“Our aim is to prevent people from being cheated as quickly as we can and to help them reduce or avoid economic loss,” she added.
Zheng Junfang, chief platform governance officer of Alibaba, said they technological innovations to assist police officers in fighting fraud and ensuring public security, “because combating fraud requires effort from all walks of life”.

86163,Main,17,13/12/2019,BIG WIN AGAIN FOR MMC GAMUDA,,"LONDON: Fresh from winning two industry awards in November, MMC Gamuda KVMRT (T) Sdn Bhd has bagged the Innovation in Tunnel Excavation award, this time from leading British civil engineering monthly New Civil Engineer (NCE) magazine. The magazine is a flagship publication of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a chartered body that oversees the practice of civil engineering in Britain.
The announcement was made at the NCE Tunnelling Festival last week, where MMC Gamuda’s Autonomous Tunnel Boring Machine (A-TBM) prevailed over five European contenders.
The A-TBM won the NCE judges over with its unprecedented use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) control algorithms to revolutionise tunnelling construction like never before. It is a world’s first, with an automated system that is able to monitor machine data in real time and assume control of various tunnelling construction sub-systems optimally. It has shown faster response times, improved accuracy and tangible productivity benefits resulting in overall safer tunnelling. 
Developed in-house, the A-TBM last won the Technical Product/Equipment Innovation of the Year award at the 2019 International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association (ITA) Tunnelling Awards event at the 8th Annual Cutting-Edge Conference in Miami on Nov 18.
The MMC Gamuda team credited with the success of A-TBM consists of a mostly Malaysian task force made up of Ng Hau Wei (project sponsor), Justin Chin Jing Ho (project lead), Russell Jon Batty (technical lead), John Lim Ji Xiong (lead AI developer) and Sam Liew Kit Shen (lead PLC developer).
“We presented the tunnelling challenges we sought to solve, and demonstrated a clear understanding of how this could be met with our A-TBM. We had to give the specifics of our innovation and how it builds on or differs from other current practices or solutions. Along with this, we explained the processes that drove the development of our innovation, such as highlighting feasibility studies carried out, trials done on other projects, or collaboration with external stakeholders and/or industry bodies,” said Ng on the judging process.
According to Chin, their advisor Gusztav Klados, with an extensive background in tunnelling spanning over 40 years, had piqued their curiosity with his previous experiences encountering a rudimentary TBM automated steering system. 
“He challenged us to develop an auto-steering functionality in-house, given advancements in current technology, especially in computing power. The team was assembled based on their backgrounds where John had prior exposure to AI and machine learning in university before while Sam was already familiar with PLCs as part of his day-to-day electrical engineering job. 
“Russel was appointed to manage technical troubleshooting while I held weekly sessions with John and others to tune and optimise the behaviour of the system so that it would drive the TBMs as we intended it to. In over half a year, we achieved this auto-steering functionality on the TBMs.
“After this initial success, we realised that we could and should try automating more sub-systems of the TBMs, not just the steering. And thus, began the official development of the A-TBM to what it is today. We continued with our weekly sessions to drive the incremental and progressive automation of each sub-system on the TBMs, and this has been going on for the past year and a half,” said Chin, who is also acting general manager for tunnelling. 
 The A-TBM was put to work in the Sungai-Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya (SSP) MRT line of the Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit project, which passes through four distinct geological formations of Kuala Lumpur. 
With MMC Gamuda as the main work package contractor, the autonomous system was deployed into the project TBMs, where all related mining drives this year have been successfully completed with minimal incidents.
This success of the autonomous system echoes the prowess of the variable density TBM introduced by MMC Gamuda in the now completed Sungai-Buloh-Kajang MRT line that hosts seven underground stations.
Back then, the variable density TBM, also a world’s first, tackled Kuala Lumpur’s complex geologies – such as those presented by karstic limestone – in a highly competent manner. For that, the variable density TBM won the Technical Innovation of the Year 2014 Award from the International Tunnelling Association.
“We were extremely gratified to be able to share our story before an enthusiastic audience and collectively uplift the industry in terms of efficiency, constructability, and safety,” said Chin.
“We’re overjoyed at this award, considering that we picked up an award from the ITA last month,” he added. 
For Ng, excellence cannot be separated from hard work. 
“We’ve poured a lot of sweat and tears into this innovation, but it’s ultimately thanks to our stakeholders who entrusted us to deliver the SSP MRT line, which is expected to complete mining works by the second quarter of 2020,” he said.",london fresh industry award mmc gamuda kvmrt sdn bhd innovation tunnel excavation award time british civil engineering civil engineer nce magazine magazine flagship publication institution civil engineer body oversees practice civil engineering britain announcement nce festival week mmc autonomous tunnel boring machine tbm european contender nce judge unprecedented artificial intelligence control revolutionise construction system monitor machine data real time control construction system response time accuracy tangible productivity benefit house tbm technical product equipment innovation international underground space association ita tunnelling award event annual cutting edge conference miami nov mmc gamuda team success tbm malaysian task force hau wei project sponsor justin chin project lead russell jon technical lead john lim xiong lead developer sam kit shen lead plc challenge understanding tbm specific innovation differs current practice solution process development innovation feasibility study trial project external stakeholder industry body process chin advisor gusztav extensive background curiosity previous experience rudimentary tbm system develop auto functionality house advancement current technology power team background john prior exposure machine learning university sam familiar plcs day day electrical engineering job russel manage technical held weekly session tune behaviour system drive tbms half achieved auto functionality initial success system official development tbm weekly session incremental progressive automation system tbms half chin acting manager tbm sungai buloh serdang putrajaya ssp mrt valley mass rapid transit project distinct geological formation lumpur mmc gamuda main package contractor autonomous system project tbms mining drive minimal incident success autonomous system variable density tbm mmc gamuda sungai buloh mrt host underground station variable density tbm kuala lumpur complex geology karstic limestone competent manner variable density technical innovation international association gratified share story enthusiastic audience uplift industry term constructability safety chin award ita month excellence lot sweat tear stakeholder ssp mrt complete mining quarter,"[(1, 0.35256916), (3, 0.6450404)]",3
