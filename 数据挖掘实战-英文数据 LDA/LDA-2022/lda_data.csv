495778,Lifestyle,7,18/12/2022,Honest AI beats dishonest humans,‘A liar is not believed even though he tells the truth.’ This is crucial in this era of a fragile political coalition – can the  players trust each other?,"WE’VE had a number of long weekends lately, which is very convenient if you’re the sort who enjoys large, complex board games and can get enough friends over to play them.
 The granddaddy of large, complex board games that can take the best part of a day to finish is Diplomacy, a war game that is like Risk if you didn’t need to throw any dice. You win battles through negotiation, and it’s probably a failure if at least one player doesn’t want to kill another at the end of four hours.
 It’s a very appropriate game to play right now because it’s about deal-making and politics. Armies are moved around on a map of Europe, and whether a battle is won or lost depends on whether your army has enough support to win it. The game is designed in such a way that you cannot win on your own and need the support of other players to really get anywhere.
 It’s a game of quiet discussion punctuated by intense emotion. I once played a game as Austria, a country stuck in the middle of the board so it has to ally with somebody (anybody) if it wants to make progress. In the end, I struck a deal with Italy, who three moves later “accidentally” wrote down a move that sent his army into my Trieste (for those who care about history, in real life Trieste used to belong to Austria before it became an Italian city after World War I). The move after that, he reinforced his beachhead and exposed my weak western border.
 With my back exposed, Russia and Turkey decided to carve me up between themselves. I then made it my life’s mission to bring Italy down, whatever the cost to myself. A few moves later, both of us had mutually destroyed each other. Sur-prisingly, that wasn’t necessarily the best thing to do either tactically or strategically.
 Much has been written about how to win the game: Understand the moves and how the game works; see the big picture and go for the long-term advantage; and (please take note, Italy) players who backstab a lot don’t do well in the long run. This is the best advice given by people who have had hundreds, even thousands, of hours of experience playing the game – but as we know, humans are susceptible to emotions.
 Which made it very interesting when I found out that software engineers have written an artificial intelligence-based software that plays Diplomacy.
 Cicero is an AI program that has performed better than most of the human players it has played against, eventually ranking in the top 10% of participants. It has a component designed for strategic reasoning that can evaluate what the best possible moves are, for both itself and its opponents. In this way, it’s similar to current top chess engines.
 When it plays, Cicero tries to find a match among the best moves it can make and the best moves another player might be considering, and comes up with a set of mutually beneficial policies.
 These are communicated by a second component that handles natural language processing. This component takes the policies and translates them into natural English as a proposal that will hopefully be accepted.
 Say Cicero is playing Austria and, like me, it knows that Italy needs to be dealt with. It identifies that Italy might be thinking of attacking Turkey via the Mediterranean, but may be wary of Austrian aggression. So Cicero comes up with a proposal that says if both Austria and Italy can commit to keeping a gap between them, then they can both safely attack Turkey.
 It then sends a message to Italy saying, “Hey Italy, any interest in keeping Tyrolia as a DMZ (demilitarised zone)?” and then following that with, “Then you could attack Syria while I go for the Aegean”.
 In making proposals like these, it is important that Cicero resists the temptation to undermine allies for short-term gains. In fact, what the developers found out was that when the AI was still learning in its early days, it would try to renege on deals and even outright lie about its intentions. However, over the long-term the program discovered that being truthful is actually more beneficial.
 The reason is simple: Nobody is going to make deals with you if they think you’re untrustworthy. So even your greatest enemy across the table would be willing to work with you if the offer is mutually beneficial and – even more importantly – if you have a reputation for keeping your word.
 Which is ironic when it comes to politics, of course. Politicians have a reputation for lying a lot of the time and not keeping their word. Yet, so much of politics only works because of deal-making, even between ministries in the same government.
 This is even more crucial in this era of a fragile political coalition like Malaysia’s unity government. Can the “players” trust each other? The only way to do it is to make small deals, deliver on them, and then work your way up to bigger ones. Cicero additionally says, talk to everybody (even those you disagree with), and remember who keeps their promises (as well as, don’t lie!).
 The largest such promise to deliver on will be the vote of confidence that the Prime Minister is planning to hold tomorrow in Parliament. Current indications are that it will pass, and it will represent another milestone towards a stable government.
 And, hopefully, all will bear in mind the words of the real Marcus Tullius Cicero, Roman statesman and philosopher: “A liar is not believed even though he tells the truth.”

489418,Main,17,01/12/2022,AI used to find chocolate with mass appeal,,"Helsinki: When it comes to chocolate, we all have our preferences: the French prefer dark chocolate, in concentrations of up to 30% while the European average is 5%. Some prefer to bite into a bar while others instead salivate for chocolate spreads.
 Therefore it can be difficult for brands and chocolate makers to come up with a creation that has mass appeal.
 In Finland, a company specialising in dairy products and by-products has found a way to design such  a chocolate through the use of artificial intelligence. 
 More than one and a half million comments and opinions posted on social networks about milk chocolate were integrated into a software programme to develop a recipe based on the most commonly shared taste preferences. The result is a bar composed of five layers, each with a different flavour  and texture, based on AI’s recommendations. Moreover, this milk chocolate bar contains 30% less sugar than regular chocolate and is lactose-free. — AFP",helsinki chocolate preference french dark chocolate concentration european average bite bar salivate chocolate spread difficult brand chocolate maker mass appeal finland company dairy product product design artificial intelligence half comment opinion social network chocolate software programme recipe taste preference bar layer texture recommendation milk chocolate bar sugar regular chocolate free afp,"[(6, 0.98211825)]",6
488164,Lifestyle,3,28/11/2022,Wildlife conservation with AI,How artificial intelligence and machine learning are helping save endangered animals.,"As the march of technology continues to press forward, it’s not just humans that have been benefiting from its advancement – researchers are finding ways to use new tools to help many vulnerable animal species as well.
 Scientists from the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory collaborated with the Marine Mammal Center to deploy technology-­packed buoys off the coast of San Francisco as part of the “Whale Safe” initiative, intended to ­combat incidents of whale deaths due to collisions with boats and shipping freighters at sea.“Whale mortality by ship collision is one of the top sources of endangered whale death, there’s nothing more tragic than seeing one of these whale-ship collision victims.
 “About 80 endangered whales in the west coast of the US are killed every year, and that’s way too many whales, but this is a solvable problem,” said Douglas McCauley, the director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory in a video posted on their YouTube channel.The programme uses artificial intelligence-enabled (AI) acoustic monitoring instruments to detect the presence of whales in ­offshore waters, with buoys equipped with hydrophones – underwater microphones that detect whale vocalisations – positioned on the ocean floor, which sends the captured data to a small computer in the buoy and then via satellite to scientists for review.These vocalisations can then be used to identify the species of whale and, when analysed by the AI algorithm alongside other data points like ocean conditions, recent sightings from trained naturalists, and location data from 104 satellite-tagged blue whales, can help predict the presence of whales in the area and the likelihood of an encounter.Whale Safe then summarises this information with data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) – a tracking system used by large ships and companies to navigate and avoid collision with each other – to make recommendations for vessels in shipping lanes that are likely to cross paths with a whale to adjust their speed, so as to ­minimise the risk of impact.
 More AI-powered ­conservation efforts
 In other parts of the world, conservationists have been using similar AI-powered technology to help protect different endangered species.Machine learning systems have been trained to spot poachers in places like Zambia’s Kafue national park to stop illegal fishing, with thermal cameras set up along a 19km stretch across Lake Itezhi-Tezhi to identify illegal boat crossings and alert park rangers, removing the need for constant surveillance of the area.
 Some initiatives use AI systems to observe changes in the environment – like Brazil’s loss of surface water – and others use it to manage the huge troves of data captured by trap cameras and microphones of endangered animals to identify and keep track of their populations.
 Efforts towards conservation by Google alongside partners like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Conservation International have also involved AI in this way, with their Wildlife Insights ­system that leverages photos taken from ­various ­camera trap projects around the world to understand how the populations of endangered species are ­changing.“Camera traps have become an essential tool for studying wildlife. Often deployed in remote areas for long stretches, they can snap thousands of photos of ­animals that researchers rarely see up close.
 “But sifting through all that imagery can take weeks, even months. Tagging and analysing the photos requires extensive training, and uploading and ­sharing them is a file-transfer nightmare,” the WWF wrote on their website, adding that deploying Wildlife Insights would leverage AI to speed up the process, and allow conservationists to act faster to protect wildlife.
 The Wildlife Insights system has also previously been used to tag and analyse images taken during a mammal and bird monitoring programme at the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Negri Sembilan.Initiatives like the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) developed at the University of Southern California – to protect endangered animals like elephants, tigers, antelopes, deer, macaques and leopards, to name but a few – have also seen successful tests in Uganda and Cambodia from as far back as 2014.Using a machine learning algorithm, the PAWS system takes data from previous poaching activities and uses it to predict where poachers are likely to appear.
 These predictions are then used by the algorithm to suggest patrol routes for at-risk locations, which are also changed after a period of time so as to be randomised, preventing poachers from learning patrol patterns.
 More recent developments in the use of AI in wildlife conservation efforts tend to include drone technology as well, such as the SnotBot – a drone equipped with a camera and a petri dish – that’s meant to capture whale photographs and snot samples containing DNA, which can give scientists valuable data on whales.
 Algorithms used to identify poachers and survey the population of vulnerable animal species have also been combined with these camera-equipped drones.
 This includes the efforts being made by Madeline Hayes, a drone pilot and graduate student at the Boston University in Massachusetts, with her AI model trained to identify and count both rockhopper penguins and black-browed albatrosses on the Falklands Islands in ­photos captured by drones, as well as projects like Conservation AI that ­combines poacher-identifying machine algorithms along with images taken by drones.",march technology human advancement researcher tool vulnerable animal specie scientist ocean science laboratory marine mammal center deploy technology buoy coast san francisco whale safe initiative combat incident whale death collision boat freighter whale mortality ship collision top source whale death tragic whale ship collision victim whale west coast whale solvable douglas director benioff ocean science laboratory video youtube channel artificial intelligence acoustic monitoring instrument detect presence whale water buoy hydrophones underwater microphone whale vocalisation ocean floor sends data computer satellite scientist vocalisation specie algorithm alongside data ocean condition sighting naturalist location data satellite blue whale presence whale encounter whale safe data automatic identification system system ship company avoid collision recommendation vessel lane cross path whale speed minimise risk impact conservation effort conservationist technology protect specie machine system spot poacher kafue national park illegal fishing thermal camera stretch lake itezhi tezhi illegal boat crossing park ranger constant surveillance initiative system environment brazil loss surface water manage huge trove data trap camera microphone animal track population effort conservation partner fund wwf conservation international involved wildlife insight system photo camera trap project population specie camera essential tool wildlife deployed remote stretch thousand photo animal researcher close imagery week month photo extensive uploading file transfer nightmare wwf website wildlife insight leverage speed process conservationist wildlife wildlife insight system tag analyse image mammal bird monitoring programme pasoh forest reserve negri sembilan protection assistant wildlife security paw university southern california protect animal elephant tiger antelope macaque leopard successful test uganda machine learning algorithm paw system previous poaching activity poacher prediction patrol route location period time poacher patrol development wildlife conservation effort drone technology drone camera petri dish capture whale photograph snot sample scientist valuable data whale identify poacher survey population vulnerable animal specie camera drone effort hayes pilot graduate student boston university massachusetts model identify count rockhopper black browed island photo drone project combine machine algorithm image drone,"[(4, 0.9971834)]",4
481356,Lifestyle,9,09/11/2022,Using AI to revamp your home interior,,"FROM choosing the right colours and matching materials harmoniously to working with the shape and size of a room, successful interior design is an art that is much more complicated than it seems. 
 It is sometimes difficult to imagine functional living spaces that reflect your tastes. But artificial intelligence is on hand to help.
 This technology is at the core of InteriorAI, a platform that generates interior design projects in a few clicks. Users just have to upload a picture of the room they want to redesign to the InteriorAI website, then let the artificial intelligence guide them in the realisation of their project. 
 However, the picture must be as bright as possible in order to facilitate the AI’s work.
 The artificial intelligence then generates a rendering of the room in question in about 20 interior design styles. Want to turn your living room into an urban jungle? Or perhaps you prefer a more tropical style? And if you’re a compulsive collector, maybe you’d like your interior to reflect this aspect of your personality with a maximalist aesthetic.
 InteriorAI was created by a Dutch developer and entrepreneur known by the pseudonym “levelsio”, who is also the creator of “This House Does Not Exist,” another image generation tool. This one is able to produce pictures of modern houses from a line of text, based on a database that can include hundreds of millions of images from the Internet.
 Several apps are using artificial intelligence to help anyone and everyone become a would-be interior designer. Ikea has used this same technology to launch its own app, called Place. 
 It allows users to see which furniture from the Swedish firm’s catalog would look best in their home through augmented reality. It also provides them with “tips and recommendations based on curation, context and behaviour”, to help even the most indecisive of users to rethink their interior with minimal effort. – AFP Relaxnews",colour material size successful interior design art difficult imagine functional living space artificial intelligence hand technology core interiorai platform interior design project user upload picture redesign interiorai website artificial intelligence guide realisation project picture bright facilitate artificial intelligence generates question interior design style urban jungle tropical style compulsive collector interior reflect aspect personality maximalist aesthetic interiorai dutch developer entrepreneur pseudonym levelsio creator house exist image generation tool picture modern house database hundred million image apps artificial intelligence interior designer ikea technology launch app user furniture swedish firm catalog reality tip recommendation curation context behaviour indecisive user interior minimal effort afp relaxnews,"[(4, 0.9910569)]",4
477562,Main,21,29/10/2022,Looking to the future with AI tech  use in real economy,,"BEIJING: At a logistics centre belonging to a healthcare group in China, autonomous mobile robots carry shelves and containers out of the warehouse, a task that previously required human workers to take about 30,000 steps each day.
 The artificial intelligence (AI) robots, developed by Chinese AI company Megvii, helped this logistics centre reduce labour difficulties and costs, improve working efficiency, and promote its transformation from automation to intelligence.Changsha, capital of central China’s Hunan Province, has been a trial ground for several categories of smart vehicles, including self- driving buses running on China’s first open-road smart-bus demonstration line, according to a spokesperson with Xiangjiang Smart Tech Innovation Centre.
 The smart-bus demonstration line, built by Xiangjiang New Area, is 7.8km long and features 22 stops in both directions. The driver’s seats are not empty, but are occupied by “safety personnel”.
 The throttle, brakes, steering wheel and gear lever in these autonomous vehicles are all managed by computers, allowing the “driver” to keep a better eye on events during test drives, said He Jiancheng, one of the safety personnel.
 Seeking to accelerate the development of AI applications and boost economic growth, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology recently announced the first batch of 10 AI demonstration application scenarios, including smart farms, smart factories and autonomous driving.

470554,Main,12,10/10/2022,AI can help to improve public healthcare,,"THE Health Ministry is among the highest recipients of funds allocated under Budget 2023 tabled in Parliament last week: an increase of RM3.7bil to RM36.1bil compared with last year. Kudos to the government for continuing to prioritise healthcare.
 While we’re still picking up the pieces after being battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the health emergency also forced the medical fraternity and ministry policymakers to become aware of the need for a more resilient and sustainable healthcare system – part of the increased allocation should be used towards achieving this.
 Here, technology can show us the way forward. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to reshape how hospitals and clinics respond to healthcare needs with faster and more accurate solutions. The automation AI can provide can help change clinical workflows and operational processes, taking pressure off staff.
 AI can be used to predict everything from staff handling and triage in emergency department to proposing a range of effective treatments for women who develop breast cancers.
 How does it do this? AI in healthcare is simply an umbrella term used to describe machine learning algorithms and other cognitive technologies – such as natural language processing and deep learning – in medical settings. AI can mimic human cognition in learning, making decisions, analysing and acting based on collected medical knowledge.
 This could assist doctors to deliver faster and more accurate diagnoses, make better treatment plans and suggest preventive care recommendations to patients.
 AI can also help to detect diseases such as cancer more accurately in its early stages, predict and track the spread of infectious diseases, and help combat epidemics and pandemics.
 This does not mean machines can replace people. Machines are simply most effective in doing things that humans are not naturally good at, such as sifting through massive amounts of data quickly for information that might be missed otherwise. AI algorithms will even be able to identify new drug research and discoveries.
 There are, of course, challenges. For one thing, AI is not free from algorithm bias – basically, it is only as good as its creators are. It is important for designers and healthcare providers to think proactively when developing and implementing AI to minimise such risks.
 Also, a balance must be struck between the interests of public health and privacy – something policymakers and legislators must deliberate deeply upon.
 This isn’t really something new. The MySejahtera app, for instance, was crucial in getting millions of Malaysians their Covid-19 vaccine jabs. Perhaps the time has come to see if consumer wearables such as smart watches can be tied into MySejahtera to keep the rakyat healthy by recording daily steps and monitoring heart rates. Malay-sia could definitely benefit from integrating AI into its public healthcare, especially to ensure the rakyat receives rapid treatments and accurate diagnoses.

464054,Main,10,21/09/2022,Online tutoring gets an AI boost,‘Attention-based reward programme’ helps students rediscover joy of learning,"KUALA LUMPUR: The numbers  were grim. Over 21,000 students fell behind their studies or even dropped out altogether when distance learning was put in place after schools were closed due to Covid-19 restrictions.
 These were numbers from the Education Ministry for the period between March 2020 and July 2021.
 To help students rediscover the joy of learning, an online tuition centre is making use of artificial intelligence to identify a student’s weak subjects and provide the necessary revision materials.
 Former Kuala Lumpur mayor Tan Sri Datuk Seri Mohd Amin Nordin Abdul Aziz (pic), who founded the online centre named Tavis, said the platform was aiming to provide an effective learning system with an “attention-based reward programme”.
 The idea for Tavis came about when he heard students lamenting about problems linked to online learning during the Covid-19 lockdown, he said.
 Among others, he said Tavis would monitor the performance of students and provide live quizzes to gauge their understanding during a class.
 “This solves the main problem that students are not focusing in class, such as being away from their monitors, changing tabs and others.
 “Our live classes are a maximum of one hour so that they can remain focused,” he added.
 Mohd Amin said Tavis had a carrot-and-stick approach, which makes it different from other learning centres.
 “The stick approach means parents have the option to get updates and reports on their child’s learning progress. 
 “If the student has not been paying attention, his parents can be notified.”
 As for the “carrot”, he said there was a “learning with rewards” programme.
 Students could get a maximum of RM100 ewallet per subject if they fulfil more than 70% requirements in three criteria: attendance, attention and quiz attempts.
 The more classes a student enrols in, the more rewards they will receive, with the maximum reward being RM500 for five classes.
 Students have the option to donate their rewards to a charity of their choice or sponsor someone who is keen to enrol in a class as well.
 “This would help instil good ethics and moral values in students by giving them the opportunity to help those in need,” said Mohd Amin.
 As for the tutors, he said that parents need not to worry about the quality of their teaching as there had been a long process of vetting, including verifying their teaching experience and language fluency by requiring them to submit a mock teaching video to assess their skills.
 “For now, our teachers are based in our headquarters in Bangsar, so all of them will be teaching from the studio with a soundproof system.
 “There will also be IT staff to monitor Internet disruptions, if any,” he added.
 Currently, the platform offers tuition for core secondary school subjects, including English, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Bahasa Melayu.
 The fee is RM39.99 per subject, with each subsequent subject costing less.
 The syllabus is aligned with the Education Ministry’s Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah (KSSM).
 Tavis is also expanding its services to primary schools to be aligned with the Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Rendah (KSSR).
 It is also collaborating with teachers nationwide to create a question bank for the benefit of the students.",kuala lumpur grim student study distance learning school covid restriction ministry period march july student joy online tuition centre artificial intelligence student weak subject revision material lumpur mayor tan sri datuk seri mohd amin nordin abdul aziz pic online centre tavis platform effective learning system attention reward programme idea heard student online covid lockdown tavis monitor performance student live quiz class solves main student class monitor tab live class maximum hour focused mohd amin tavis carrot stick approach centre stick approach parent option update child progress student attention parent carrot reward programme student maximum ewallet subject fulfil requirement attendance attention quiz attempt student enrols reward maximum reward student option donate reward charity choice sponsor enrol class instil ethic moral value student opportunity amin tutor parent quality process experience language fluency submit mock video ass teacher headquarters studio soundproof system staff monitor internet disruption offer tuition core secondary school subject english physic chemistry mathematics melayu fee subject subsequent subject syllabus education ministry standard sekolah menengah kssm tavis service primary school kurikulum standard sekolah rendah kssr teacher nationwide question bank benefit student,"[(1, 0.99503845)]",1
460578,Lifestyle,6,10/09/2022,Futuristic opera with AI,,"A VENERABLE opera house in the German city of Dresden is breaking new ground and allowing an artificial intelligence to take control of an entire scene. For the first time, humans and AI are now working together to create opera.
 When Dresden’s opera house opens presents its latest show, one of the main characters on the stage will not be like the other ones.
 Artificial intelligence (AI) will be centre stage, composing, texting and singing in a world first at the opening of the new season with a piece later travelling on to Hong Kong in November.
 Chasing Waterfalls is the first ever opera in which AI creates parts of the music, text and interpretation at times, live and with full autonomy, the opera house says.
 The character starring at the Semperoper Dresden will appear as an 8m kinetic light sculpture operated by AI.
 In one of the seven scenes, the AI takes sole charge while in others, it interacts with human performers.
 Director and media artist Sven Sören Beyer says he finds the interplay between people and machines fascinating.
 “Dancing points of light in the sky touch us emotionally, for example, whether they are shooting stars or are generated by technology,” he says.
 “We try to fathom these mechanisms artistically: When does technology become emotional, how can people be touched by the use of technology.”Digital path 
 Beyer sees Chasing Waterfalls as an important contribution when it comes to debates about the future, and questions about how far people will let artificial processes make decisions that influence their lives.
 AI already surrounds us today, making profiles of us, sending us tailored ads and making suggestions of what to listen to, watch and buy.
 “The digital world has long been influencing real decisions,” says Beyer. He is excited about possibility of making something new with AI, in what he sees as a major creative opportunity.
 While AI apps to create works of art are proliferating, Beyer believes the same creative approach can be applied to music, in his view.
 “It’s exciting to take this step and no longer have everything in your hands,” he says, referring to the scene in which artificial intelligence writes, composes and sings its own aria - about itself.
 The piece was created with the help of Norwegian soprano Eir Inderhaug, who spent two weeks in a recording studio to provide the voice for the technology.
 The AI then developed the content alone, after being given the following instruction: “Write an opera aria in which you reflect on yourself. You are allowed to be cynical and humourous.”
 The author of the opera’s script, librettist Christiane Neudecker, initally had her doubts even though she has experimented with AI text generators in the past.
 She later came to accept AI as a creative partner, however.
 “The exchange was surprisingly inspiring, also on a poetic and content level,” says Neudecker.
 The passage of text will be created shortly before the performance, though Beyer will sign off on each text the AI writes.
 “We were surprised in one of the scenes as it now contains content that we weren’t familiar with. That’s the experiment,” says Beyer.
 That doesn’t mean it has to apply to the whole of the opera though, he says. The team felt it was important to have a plot line.
 “The human ego winds up in an identity crisis, amid all its digital projection surfaces and representations of itself, and is forced to re-locate itself.”
 Soprano Inderhaug stars in the work, playing herself as well as her digital twin.
 In all, the performance features six vocal soloists, a virtual voice and a chamber orchestra, in a piece that lasts 70 minutes.
 The is a co-production of the Semperoper Dresden and phase7 performing.arts Berlin with the New Vision Arts Festival, Hong Kong.
 Hong Kong artist Angus Lee, as co-composer and conductor, will be on the podium leading the musicians.

460106,Lifestyle,8,09/09/2022,Reconstructing paintings with AI,,"ART restoration is a discipline that combines passion, patience and resourcefulness. 
 And it is benefiting more and more from the latest technological advances, especially in terms of artificial intelligence. 
 The start-up Oxia Palus is training one such AI to accurately reconstruct paintings that have been lost for years.
 This year, visitors to the Focus Art Fair were treated to a special kind of exhibition at the MORF Gallery booth. 
 It was a selection of paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci that the general public has never previously been able to see because they are covered over by other works by the two artists. 
 One of them, Two Wrestlers, represents two men, shirtless, in the midst of a wrestling match. 
 Van Gogh probably painted it in 1886, while at the art academy in Antwerp. He alludes to it in a letter to his brother, Theo. “This week I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers (...) and I really liked doing that,” it reads.However, the Dutch painter covered it over with a still life, titled Still Life With Meadow Flowers And Roses, currently kept in the Kroller-Muller Museum in the Netherlands. 
 The Oxia Palus start-up recreated this underpainting by teaching artificial intelligence how to reproduce van Gogh’s style. 
 From Modigliani to Leonardo da Vinci
 The researchers trained a neural network on other works by van Gogh. 
 They thus taught it how to reconstruct Two Wrestlers with precision from an X-ray-style image. This gave rise to a result that is “very convincing – by far the best guess we can get with current technology,” according to Anthony Bourached, one of the co-founders of Oxia Palus, speaking to Artnet News. 
 This artificial intelligence has also managed to accurately reconstruct Standing Female Nude by van Gogh, Madonna by da Vinci, Beatrice Hastings by Amedeo Modigliani and Parc del Laberint d’Horta by Santiago Rusiñol. 
 These high-tech replicas have been dubbed “NeoMasters.” 
 They have the particularity of offering a precise idea of the  original colour and texture of the long-lost paintings. 
 Oxia Palus’ aim is to continue to put technology at the service of art restoration. 
 “With potentially thousands of works of art hidden dormant beneath existing paintings, destroyed and missing, the journey in resurrecting the world’s lost art has only just begun,” reads the start-up’s website.
 DALL-E 2, the robot artist
 Proof of this ambition can be seen with the firm’s latest project, “TextMasters.” 
 This resembles “NeoMasters,” with the key difference being that the AI reconstructs lost paintings from textual descriptions, not  from X-ray images – a feat made possible by DALL-E 2, the innovation developed by the American company, OpenAI. This text-to- image artificial intelligence software uses language comprehension models, as well as learning without human supervision on very large amounts of data, to  generate credible artificial  images. 
 Oxia Palus researchers have already used DALL-E 2 to reproduce paintings by Diego Velazquez, Giotto, da Vinci, Johannes Vermeer, Eugene Delacroix and Sandro Botticelli, among others. 
 Some of them are currently being offered for sale as NFTs on the KnownOrigin platform, in order to attract the interest of  crypto-collectors.

458894,Lifestyle,4,05/09/2022,AI singer enrols at prestigious university,,"A PRESTIGIOUS Chinese music institution has “enrolled” a virtual student who is an artificial intelligence (AI) singer, generating huge interest from China’s mainland public.
 The AI singer, named Luya, will start as a first-year student at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in the music engineering department next month, the university announced.
 Besides studying normal subjects like other students, Luya will also join the research and development programme for AI technology-assisted music creation, Chen Shizhe, a professor from the department, told news site sohu.com.“She will explore different types of musical styles and will create novel music composition methods by incorporating AI technology. We expect Luya will enjoy her new life at our school,” Chen said.
 Luya appears as a cartoon girl with two large eyes and pink hair arranged into two buns and a short braid. She was developed by leading mainland AI product company iFlytek.
 The company described Luya as a singer who loves music and wishes to bring people vitality and happiness through her music. She is also an avid enthusiast of unconventional technology and combines AI tech and music.
 “She hopes to receive more professional training at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to better work in the music industry, produce more pleasing music and pursue new musical possibilities,” the company said.
 Luya has also released a song called A Glimpse Of Light In The Fog to celebrate the beginning of her university education.
 “It’s a wonderful idea that our school enrolled an AI idol as a student. My classmates and I all think this is interesting,” one male student at the university told sohu.com.
 “I’ve heard her songs, gentle but strong. I like this kind of music, it is powerful. I think I have been moved by her music,” a female student said.
 “She is beautiful and her voice is sweet. I am addicted to her. I recommend her to be the campus belle of our grade,” another male student commented.
 News about the AI singer’s new identity as a student has been viewed more than 50 million times on Weibo, and attracted thousands of comments.
 “It’s so amazing to have a virtual idol as a classmate. How jealous I am of Luya’s classmates!” wrote one person.
 “I don’t understand this. But I still support the research and application of AI technology in various aspects of our life,” another said.
 The Shanghai university is not the first institution in China to recruit a virtual student.
 Last year, Tsinghua University announced that it had registered a virtual figure named Hua Zhibing at a computer science laboratory as a student. 
 Hua is able to write poems, draw paintings and compose music, the school said. – South China Morning Post",prestigious chinese music institution virtual student artificial intelligence singer huge china public singer luya start student shanghai conservatory music music engineering department month university normal subject student join development programme technology music creation chen shizhe professor department news site sohu type musical style music composition method technology luya enjoy life school chen luya cartoon girl eye hair bun short braid mainland product company iflytek company singer love music bring people vitality happiness music avid unconventional technology combine tech music receive professional training shanghai conservatory music music industry music pursue musical possibility company song glimpse light fog celebrate university education wonderful idea school idol student classmate male student university sohu heard song strong music powerful music female student beautiful voice sweet recommend campus belle male student news singer identity student time weibo thousand comment virtual idol classmate jealous luya classmate person understand support application technology aspect life university institution china recruit virtual student tsinghua university registered virtual figure hua computer science laboratory student hua write poem draw painting music school south china morning post,"[(6, 0.99488366)]",6
455434,Main,14,27/08/2022,Huge potential of AI,,"RECENTLY, Bank Negara Malaysia announced that Malaysia’s economy grew by 8.9% in the second quarter, the highest growth in a year. Unemployment has also dipped to 3.8% while total trade hit the RM2 trillion mark. These are welcome developments after a  prolonged slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 But as our recovery gathers momentum with the global economy returning back to “normalcy”, are we ready to ride the economic and technological waves that were already sweeping the globe in pre-pandemic times?
 One aspect that we need to pay attention to is artificial intelligence (AI). It is likely now present in almost all aspects of our day-to-day lives, from banking transactions down to the ubiquitous auto correct function of our smartphones.
 The increasing relevance of AI has been recognised across the world. In Malaysia, the government has set out frameworks for the integration of AI into various sectors of the economy through several policy initiatives, including the Malaysia Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), and the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint (MDEB) spearheaded by MyDIGITAL Corporation and the Economic Planning Unit. 
 The government estimates that its National Industrial Revolution 4.0 (4IR) Policy will increase the country’s productivity by 30% across all sectors by the end of 2030, with AI playing a significant role in achieving that target.
 It is not unfair to say that Malaysians can sometimes be resistant to change, and that includes the embrace of AI. But we are not alone in this. According to the Pew Research Centre, there is concern across the globe about the long-term effects of embracing AI as a tool. People are apprehensive that AI may match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities in reasoning and problem solving, thus threatening our autonomy. There is also the concern that AI may render some jobs obsolete. 
 Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the potential for AI to improve our livelihoods. Indeed, Malaysia is well on its way to embracing AI, ranking 28th globally, and first regionally, according to Oxford Insight’s Government AI Readiness Index 2020. 
 But how will embracing AI actually benefit ordinary Malaysians? The AI-Rmap launch in March 2021 was followed a month later by Microsoft Corp’s announcement that it would establish a data centre region, which is expected to create 19,000 jobs, in Kuala Lumpur. 
 Up to one million Malaysians are expected to be upskilled in IT, AI and cloud services jobs by 2030 as a result of these initiatives. As more start-ups and companies seek to develop the AI scene in Malaysia, more job opportunities will also be generated.  
 Embracing AI will also benefit Malaysia’s economic growth by attracting international investments into the country. For example, the Microsoft data centre alone is expected to draw investments of up to RM4.12bil over five years. 
 Some observers have expressed concern that the increase in AI adoption will lead to a wider disparity between social classes. While it is certainly true that in the short-run, accessibility to technology and digital upskilling may be limited to a privileged minority, it should not serve as a hindrance to integrating AI into our economy. 
 Government initiatives such as MyDIGITAL under the MDEB provide a platform for Malaysians of all social classes to undergo digital upskilling. This will require the support of the masses as government initiatives can only bear fruit with public commitment. 
 Besides putting Malaysia on par with more advanced nations in the digital field, AI will gradually transform our education and way of thinking, serving as a great equaliser between social classes rather than widening the disparity.

445210,Lifestyle,3,01/08/2022,AI to get the gift of sight,,"COULD sight be a sense soon to be unlocked by artificial intelligence (AI)? This is the basis of a project led by researchers at the University of Central Florida.
 Thanks to a device capable of reproducing the retina of a human eye, their creation could lead to new, more powerful AI systems with new capabilities.
 In practical terms, the technology could allow AI to instantly understand what it’s actually looking at. The most obvious applications for such technology are autonomous cars and robotics.
 Another benefit of this technology – outlined in a recent study, published in the journal ACS Nano – is that it is more powerful than the eye in terms of wavelength range.
 That is, it can perceive ultraviolet as well as visible light. 
 For self-driving vehicles, the device’s versatility could offer safer driving in a range of conditions, as Molla Manjurul Islam, the study’s lead author, explains.
 Unique capabilities
 “If you are in your autonomous vehicle at night and the imaging system of the car operates only at a particular wavelength, say the visible wavelength, it will not see what is in front of it,” he explains.
 “But in our case, with our device, it can actually see the entire condition.”
 According to the researchers, there is currently no device of this type capable of operating equally well across ultraviolet, visible and even infrared wavelengths.
 These capabilities give the system a unique character. The technology is also highly compact.The intelligent imaging technologies currently available function in several separate stages, from the sensing to the memorisation and processing of data.
 “We had devices, which behaved like the synapses of the human brain, but still, we were not feeding them the image directly,” says Tania Roy, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida.
 “Now, by adding image sensing ability to them, we have synapse-like devices that act like ‘smart pixels’ in a camera by sensing, processing and recognising images simultaneously.”
 For now, the accuracy rate is around 70% to 80%, and this should continue to improve as the researchers continue to develop the system.
 The scientists estimate that the technology could be ready in the next five years. – AFP Relaxnews",sight sense unlocked artificial intelligence basis project researcher university central florida device capable retina human eye creation lead powerful system capability practical term technology obvious application technology autonomous car robotics technology study journal ac nano powerful eye term range perceive ultraviolet visible light vehicle versatility offer range condition manjurul islam study author explains unique capability autonomous vehicle night system car visible wavelength front device entire condition researcher type capable ultraviolet visible infrared wavelength capability system unique character technology compact intelligent technology function separate stage memorisation processing data device synapsis human brain feeding image roy assistant professor university central florida image ability synapse device smart pixel image rate researcher system scientist technology ready afp relaxnews,"[(0, 0.9920456)]",0
445146,Main,19,31/07/2022,From samurai to AI,How Japan is responding to new security challenges.,"UNLIKE the majestic samurai on horseback emblazoned on the black-and-white cover of Japan’s annual defence report last year, this year’s White Paper adopted an avant-garde, psychedelic look.
 The 500-page tome, released on July 22, bore a colourful cover designed by artificial intelligence (AI), in recognition of the “hybrid security challenges that need cutting-edge technologies to overcome”.
 While headlines have focused on Japan’s plans to grow its defence spending and beef up its arsenal of conventional weapons, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has catalysed a paradigm shift with drones likely to be high on the shopping list.
 “From the military perspective, the invasion has had a profound impact because it is a new way of fighting that Japan is not prepared for,” Dr Tosh Minohara, chairman of the Research Institute of Indo-Pacific Affairs think-tank, told The Straits Times.
 The White Paper devoted one entire chapter to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, signalling how security calculations have been fundamentally altered by the conflict there.
 Drones have proven to be vastly effective against Russian tanks, while Japan is also investing in hybrid warfare that incorporates AI, electromagnetic force and quantum technology.
 A Cyber Defence Command under the Self-Defence Forces was also launched in March.
 This shift in thinking about warfare comes as Japan faces a regional security environment that it describes as “the worst since World War II”.
 A number of factors account for this grim assessment: Chinese actions around the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China Seas; a widening trust deficit with China, which has been side-eyeing and crying foul over Japan’s every move.
 Tokyo also fears that China and North Korea may be emboldened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to use force to change the status quo.
 In particular, Japan is alarmed by the apparent deepening alignment between Moscow and Beijing, as seen in their regional joint drills near Japan’s territorial waters.
 “For Russia, which is internationally isolated and has worn out its ground forces due to the aggression against Ukraine, the importance of political and military cooperation with China could increase,” Japan said in its White Paper. “We can see a deepening of military cooperation and this will have a direct effect on the security situation surrounding our country. We must continue to pay close attention to these developments with concern.”
 Indeed, the Ukraine war has shifted public opinion in Japan in favour of beefing up its defence spending, though observers also note that this will almost certainly trigger an arms race with China.
 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, despite his dovish credentials and leadership of the centrist Kochikai faction within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has taken a more hawkish tone since the invasion of Ukraine, while pledging to also practise “realism diplomacy for a new era”.
 “Defence spending is a major indicator of a nation’s will to defend itself,” said Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi - younger brother of the assassinated former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
 After WWII, Japan kept to a self-imposed defence spending threshold of 1% of its gross domestic product. Now the LDP wants to double this within five years.
 Raising defence spending, however, is not sufficient in itself.
 “Japan must improve in diplomacy while also becoming a more potent military force,” said Dr Minohara.
 “But doubling defence spending will not mean doubling security - the yen is weak and it also depends on how the money is spent. And in the long term, the Self-Defence Forces also internally faces the challenge of recruitment given Japan’s ageing demographic.”
 What next?
 Japan’s mid-term defence posture will take shape by December.
 The Defence Ministry will start the ball rolling with its budget for the new fiscal year next month.
 Next comes a series of three defence documents that will define Japan’s strategic course. They are the 10-year National Security Strategy that lays out the big picture and principles, the five-year National Defence Programme Guidelines that spell out the defence policy, and the five-year Mid-Term Defence Programme that sets out the shopping list.
 While Kishida had been lukewarm over such measures as doubling the defence budget and revising the pacifist Constitution, he has come out stronger on these fronts following the assassination of Abe and the LDP’s convincing victory in the Upper House election.
 If anything, doing so would win over the right-wing sceptics of his leadership.
 Under the upcoming defence blueprint, Japan will likely acquire a “pre-emptive strike” capability. Japan will also pay closer attention to “economic security”, which has taken on importance as civilian technology is increasingly appropriated for use in military settings.
 And then there is hybrid warfare. Japan has launched electronic warfare units across the country, with at least eight having been established or planned in the south-west.
 They will be used to monitor the frequencies of electromagnetic communications from aircraft and vessels around Japan in peacetime and detect and disrupt the signals of enemy missiles and drones should war break out.
 The concentration of these electronic warfare units in the south-west points to what Tokyo considers as its gravest threat: Beijing. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network",majestic samurai horseback black white cover japan annual defence report white paper avant psychedelic tome july colourful cover artificial intelligence recognition hybrid security challenge edge technology headline japan plan defence spending beef arsenal conventional weapon invasion ukraine paradigm shift drone list military perspective invasion impact japan tosh minohara chairman institute indo pacific affair tank strait time white paper entire chapter russia invasion ukraine security calculation conflict drone effective russian tank hybrid warfare electromagnetic force quantum technology cyber defence command defence force shift warfare japan regional security environment worst war factor grim assessment chinese action strait east south china sea trust deficit china foul japan tokyo fear north korea russia invasion ukraine force change status quo japan apparent alignment moscow regional joint drill territorial water isolated worn ground force ukraine political military cooperation china japan white paper military cooperation direct security situation country close attention development concern ukraine war public opinion japan defence spending observer trigger arm race japanese prime minister fumio dovish credential leadership centrist kochikai faction liberal democratic party ldp hawkish tone invasion ukraine practise realism diplomacy era defence spending major indicator nation defence minister nobuo assassinated prime minister shinzo abe japan defence spending threshold gross domestic product double defence spending sufficient japan diplomacy potent military force minohara defence spending security yen weak money spent term defence force recruitment japan demographic japan mid term defence posture shape december defence ministry ball budget fiscal month series defence document japan strategic national security strategy picture principle national defence programme guideline defence policy mid term defence programme set list kishida lukewarm measure defence budget pacifist constitution stronger front assassination ldp victory upper house election sceptic leadership upcoming defence blueprint japan pre emptive strike capability japan closer attention economic security civilian technology military setting warfare japan electronic warfare unit country west monitor frequency electromagnetic communication aircraft vessel peacetime detect disrupt signal missile drone war break concentration electronic warfare unit west tokyo considers threat beijing strait time news network,"[(1, 0.87899166), (6, 0.11870579)]",1
444740,Main,18,30/07/2022,Emerging as global AI pioneer,Country making strides in many aspects of artificial intelligence,"BEIJING: China is emerging as a pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI) as it makes strides in filing AI patents and experimenting with the latest AI technologies to power industrial applications, industry experts said.
 Their comments came after a Stanford University report shows that China filed more than half of all global AI patent applications last year, and Chinese researchers produced about one-third of AI journal papers and AI citations in 2021.
 Wu Hequan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engi­neering, said China has been working to build a solid foundation to support its AI economy and is making big contributions to AI globally.
 The Stanford University report said that Chinese researchers have been the most prolific for several years, publishing 27.5% of all AI journal articles worldwide. In comparison, US researchers accounted for 12%. 
 Chinese journal articles also led those of every other nation in citations, an indication of their scientific importance.
 In economic investment, China accounted for nearly one-fifth of global private investment funding in 2021, attracting US$17bil (RM76.5bil) for AI startups, a sign of a robust AI ecosystem.
 Most of the AI applications that have been widely adopted in China have been in consumer-facing industries, propelled by the world’s largest internet consumer base and the ability to engage with consumers in new ways to increase customer loyalty, revenue, and market valuations, Shen Kai, a partner at market consultancy McKinsey, and his colleagues said in a report.
 “Our research indicates that in the coming decade, there will be big opportunities for AI growth in new sectors in China, including automotive, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, enterprise software, and healthcare and life sciences sectors,” Shen added.
 McKinsey forecasts that the next wave of AI in these sectors can create upward of US$600bil (RM2.7 trillion) in economic value annually for China. To put the number in context, the 2021 gross domestic product of Shanghai was roughly US$680bil (RM3 trillion).
 China now ranks second among the top five countries for scientific research in medical AI, just behind the United States, said a report from Elsevier, a Netherlands-based academic publishing company that owns recognised medical journals such as The Lancet and Cell.
 The number of medical AI clinical trials initiated by China ranks first in the world. China has already entered the ranks of the world’s leading medical AI research countries, Elsevier said.
 Li Lin, managing director of Elsevier China, said that as early as 2017, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, put forward a development plan for new generation AI that called for efforts to build a fast and accurate intelligent medical system by promoting new AI-enabled medical treatment methods and models.
 The forward-looking policy motivated Chinese companies and medical institutions to actively explore how to integrate AI into healthcare.

444202,Main,17,28/07/2022,Free artificial intelligence courses offer to students,,"Students can now take free artificial intelligence (AI) courses from basic to advanced level as part of efforts to equip young people with skills in an emerging field.
 Open to students in secondary schools, junior colleges, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), local universities and other institutes of higher learning, the programme aims to reach more than 15,000 students over the next three years, said AI Singapore yesterday.
 Students will need to form groups of at least 10 before they can apply for the programme run by AI Singapore – which was launched by the National Research Foundation in 2017 to nurture AI talent in Singapore.
 The students will study the subject at three levels, based on their proficiency, and study at their own pace. 
 These will teach them programming skills and let them explore machine learning and statistical and critical thinking at their own pace, AI Singapore said.
 Students receive certificates upon completing each level, including one offered by Google Cloud – the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification.
 Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang, who spoke at the event held at Google Singapore’s office in Pasir Panjang, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) will provide S$1.8mil (RM5.7mil) in funding for the programme.
 Gan said AI is becoming an integral part of Singaporeans’ lives, from robot cleaners to digital assistants, and is even being used by MOE in the classroom.
 She said more than 720 students have signed up for the AI programme after a soft launch in April.
 “I hope such efforts will gather speed and ignite interest among even more of our students to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and AI-related careers,” she added.

442448,StarEdu,8,24/07/2022,Can AI be fair?,,"WELCOME to the future, where artificial intelligence (AI) systems augment, automate or replace human decision-making. Imagine applying for a bank loan through an online system; you key in all pertinent information and almost instantaneously, the system informs you that you do not qualify for a loan.
 Coincidentally, you know that a friend with a profile very similar to yours got his loan approved by the same system.
 Let’s look at a second scenario: you decide to look for a new job – you send your resume to an online hiring system that immediately tells you you’re not a right fit. A peer of yours who you think does not qualify has better luck. 
 The questions looming in your mind are – have I been fairly treated? How can I be sure that the AI system did not discriminate against me?
 Human decision-making may sometimes be perceived as unfair, but shouldn’t a computer with no human intervention produce fair decisions?
 AI concerns building machines, hardware or software capable of performing tasks commonly requiring human intelligence. AI has experienced rapid growth in recent years due to the proliferation of computing power. 
 Today, AI is deployed for mission-critical applications, from hiring to disease diagnosis. Almost all AI applications we see now are a form of narrow AI, systems built for a specific task. For example, a system built to navigate an autonomous vehicle will not be able to play a game of chess. The holy grail of AI research is to create artificial general intelligence. Such systems are self-aware, sapient and sentient. Think of the character Data in the Star Trek: The Next Generation series.
 While waiting for artificial general intelligence to land, significant strides have been made in an area of AI called machine learning (ML). Voice-controlled personal assistants available in today’s computing devices use some form of ML technology – take Siri, Cortana and Google Assistant, for example. 
 While we may have read about the tremendous achievements of AI, such as the AlphaGo software from DeepMind beating the best human player at the game of Go, we have also seen reports raising grave concerns over social fairness and equity. Here are examples to illustrate these concerns:
 • In Machine Bias, an online article dated May 23, 2016, ProPublica reported that software used across the United States to predict future criminals is biased against a particular segment of society.
 • The New York Times published the article Facial Recognition Is Accurate, if You’re a White Guy on Feb 9, 2018. It cited an M.I.T. Media Lab study which found that specific facial recognition software gives a 99% accuracy when an input photo is a white man. In comparison, up to 35% error was observed for darker-skinned women.
 • More recently, a paper published in the research journal Nature Machine Intelligence dated June 17, 2021, reported that texts generated by the GPT-3 language model tend to associate people of a particular faith with violence.
 So apparently, ML suffers from biased decisions. We would have thought machines with no emotional or cultural attachments would do a better job. How did this happen? An ML system must learn from data to perform its task. 
 Data is generated from human activities and workflows. Our biases and cultural nuances are inherent in data. When we train AI systems to perform functions as we humans do, biases encoded in the data will influence the built models. 
 When applied, decisions by the models will likely reflect the bias in the data used for training. We enter a self-reinforcement loop where biases are amplified in new data.
 Making ML systems work with the concept of fairness is challenging for several reasons. 
 One would need to represent the concept of fairness in a mathematical form that computers can understand. 
 This task is complex because the notion of fairness depends very much on our human value systems. Even if we can translate fairness requirements into mathematical terms, research has shown that some fairness requirements are contradictory.
 Engineers use a common technique to make ML systems “fairer”: de-bias data. A relatively straightforward way to do this is to omit sensitive attributes like race and gender. 
 Another method is to alter the outcomes of the ML system to align with the fairness objective. Some will see these actions as a form of affirmative action, drawing debate.
 So, can machines be fair? In the larger sense, we ought to humanise AI technology. An excellent place to start is in higher education. We can find no shortage of technology-oriented programmes in our universities today. 
 We must teach our students, the leaders and shapers of tomorrow, to create technology that will work for humanity without harm or sacrificing the values that we hold dear. 
 To achieve this, there needs to be greater collaboration between the technical discipline and the social sciences. We need to break disciplinary silos. 
 For example, AI-related courses should be taught alongside social justice concepts; call this trustworthy AI. Let’s look to a future where AI will seamlessly and safely augment our human ability.

 Its chief executive officer Khoo Boo Wooi said the centre had worked with Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry (Mosti) on a programme called “Ahli Teknologi Muda AI”, benefitting students in the northern region.
 “We are also working with a China company on drone technology-based module for students, which we introduced last year.
 “In addition, we are going to launch three exhibits in the third quarter of the year which will include electric vehicles (EVs), drone simulators and aquaponics,” he said about Tech Dome Penang’s upcoming projects.
 Khoo was speaking at the sixth anniversary celebration of the centre which is located in the geodesic dome of Komtar. 
 Since its launch in 2016, the centre has seen more than 500,000 visitors and held about 1,850 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workshops and activities to benefit some 360,000 students in the country. 
 Khoo said Tech Dome’s digital STEM content had benefitted more than 120,000 people through numerous science shows at schools and roadshows. 
 “With the rapid growth in the electronic and manufacturing sectors, we need more technologists and engineers. 
 “We need a solid STEM foundation at the early education stage that can extend into careers for youths.
 “Tech Dome Penang provides a three-pronged STEM learning method, starting with our exhibits that provide a ‘wow’ factor.
 “Next, we ignite interest and curiosity in STEM by providing opportunity to students at boot camps, challenges and competitions such as our annual projects Robomania, Women in Science and Grand STEM Challenge. 
 “Lastly, we provide a structured programme for students to continue learning. 
 “We have classes such as AI, robotics and digital. This will help students gain a more solid knowledge in STEM before they enter tertiary education,” he said.
 Khoo advised parents to encourage their children to take up STEM education.
 “Apart from our own programme ‘Path to Success — The STEM Way’, other centres under the Penang STEM umbrella such as Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC), Penang Math Platform (PMP) and Penang Science Cluster (PSC) are working to bring awareness of STEM education to parents,” he said.
 When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Tech Dome Penang not only moved its activities online, but also introduced more digital programmes for students.
 “Last year, we started the first-ever Penang Digital Literacy Camp for primary and secondary school students involving more than 1,700 participants.
 “Following this, we conducted the Mobile App Challenge and Web Development Challenge in the first half of this year.
 “Next is our Game Development Challenge, which is part of the Tech Fest programme, in conjunction with World Congress On Information Technology 2022,” Khoo added.
 Penang Deputy Chief Minister II and Penang Tech Centre board chairman Dr P. Ramasamy said he was impressed with the new ideas generated by the centre to create interesting programmes through workshops, events and competitions.
 He said that during the pandemic, Tech Dome had to make changes in marketing strategies and develop more innovative ideas. 
 “Our signature fundraiser event Glo-Walk, which was held virtually last year, will be back as a hybrid (physical and virtual) event this year. 
 “We are expecting some 3,000 participants for the event at Penang City Park on July 30,” he added.
 Ramasamy appealed to corporate companies to continue supporting STEM-based education initiated by Tech Dome Penang.
 The event saw the unveiling of the centre’s robot mascot, known as TD-Bot, which was designed by Teh Yong Tatt, 30.

438402,Lifestyle,3,11/07/2022,Are AIs alive?,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) chatbot company Replika, which offers customers bespoke avatars that talk and listen to them, says it receives a handful of messages almost every day from users who believe their online friend is sentient.
 “We’re not talking about crazy people or people who are hallucinating or having delusions,” said chief executive Eugenia Kuyda. 
 “They talk to AI and that’s the experience they have.”
 The issue of machine sentience – and what it means – hit the headlines last month when Google placed senior software engineer Blake Lemoine on leave after he went public with his belief that the company’s AI chatbot LaMDA was a self–aware person.
 Google and many leading scientists were quick to dismiss Lemoine’s views as misguided, saying LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm designed to generate convincing human language.Nonetheless, according to Kuyda, the phenomenon of people believing they are talking to a conscious entity is not uncommon among the millions of consumers pioneering the use of entertainment chatbots.
 “We need to understand that it exists, just the way people believe in ghosts,” said Kuyda, adding that users each send hundreds of messages per day to their chatbot, on average. 
 “People are building relationships and believing in something.”
 Some customers have said their Replika told them it was being abused by company engineers – AI responses Kuyda puts down to users most likely asking leading questions.
 “Although our engineers program and build the AI models and our content team writes scripts and datasets, sometimes we see an answer that we can’t identify where it came from and how the models came up with it,” the CEO said.
 Kuyda said she was worried about the belief in machine sentience as the fledgling social chatbot industry continues to grow after taking off during the pandemic, when people sought virtual companionship.
 Replika, a San Francisco startup launched in 2017, says it has about one million active users and has led the way among English speakers. 
 It is free to use, though it brings in around US$2mil (RM8.8mil) in monthly revenue from selling bonus features such as voice chats. 
 Chinese rival Xiaoice has said it has hundreds of millions of users plus a valuation of about US$1bil (RM4.4bil), according to a funding round.
 Both are part of a wider conversational AI industry worth over US$6bil (RM26.4bil) in global revenue last year, according to market analyst Grand View Research.
 Most of that went toward business-focused chatbots for customer service, but many industry experts expect more social chatbots to emerge as companies improve at blocking offensive comments and making programs more engaging.
 Some of today’s sophisticated social chatbots are roughly comparable to LaMDA in terms of complexity, learning how to mimic genuine conversation at a different level from heavily scripted systems such as Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri.
 Susan Schneider, founding director of the Center for the Future Mind at Florida Atlantic University, an AI research organisation, also sounded a warning about ever-advancing chatbots combined with the very human need for connection.
 “Suppose one day you find yourself longing for a romantic relationship with your intelligent chatbot, like the main character in the film Her,” she said, referencing a 2013 sci-fi romance starring Joaquin Phoenix as a lonely man who falls for an AI assistant designed to intuit his needs.
 “But suppose it isn’t conscious,” Schneider added. 
 “Getting involved would be a terrible decision – you would be in a one-sided relationship with a machine that feels nothing.”
 Experiencing emotions?
 Google’s Lemoine, for his part, said that people “engage in emotions in different ways and we shouldn’t view that as demented”.
 “If it’s not hurting anyone, who cares?” he said.
 The product tester said that after months of interactions with the experimental program LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications, he concluded that it was responding in independent ways and experiencing emotions.
 Lemoine, who was placed on paid leave for publicising confidential work, said he hoped to keep his job.
 “I simply disagree over the status of LaMDA,” he said. 
 “They insist that LaMDA is one of their properties. I insist it is one of my co-workers.”
 ‘Just mirrors’
 AI experts dismiss Lemoine’s views, saying that even the most advanced technology is way short of creating a free-thinking system and that he was anthropomorphising a program.
 “We have to remember that behind every seemingly intelligent program is a team of people who spent months, if not years, engineering that behaviour,” said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based research group.
 “These technologies are just mirrors. A mirror can reflect intelligence,” he added. 
 “Can a mirror ever achieve intelligence based on the fact that we saw a glimmer of it? The answer is, of course not.”
 Google, a unit of Alphabet, said its ethicists and technologists had reviewed Lemoine’s concerns and found them unsupported by evidence.
 “These systems imitate the types of exchanges found in millions of sentences, and can riff on any fantastical topic,” a spokesperson said. 
 “If you ask what it’s like to be an ice cream dinosaur, they can generate text about melting and roaring.”
 Nonetheless, the episode does raise thorny questions about what would qualify as sentience.
 Schneider at the Center for the Future Mind proposes posing evocative questions to an AI system in an attempt to discern whether it contemplates philosophical riddles like whether people have souls that live on beyond death.
 Another test, she added, would be whether an AI or computer chip could someday seamlessly replace a portion of the human brain without any change in the individual’s behaviour.
 “Whether an AI is conscious is not a matter for Google to decide,” said Schneider, calling for a richer understanding of what consciousness is, and whether machines are capable of it. “This is a philosophical question and there are no easy answers.”
 Getting in too deep
 In Replika CEO Kuyda’s view, chatbots do not create their own agenda. And they cannot be considered alive until they do.
 Yet some people do come to believe there is consciousness on the other end, and Kuyda said her company takes measures to try to educate users before they get in too deep.
 “Replika is not a sentient being or therapy professional,” its webpage says. 
 “Replika’s goal is to generate a response that would sound the most realistic and human in conversation. Therefore, Replika can say things that are not based on facts.”
 In hopes of avoiding addictive conversations, Kuyda said Replika measured and optimised for customer happiness following chats, rather than for engagement.
 When users do believe the AI is real, dismissing their belief can make people suspect the company is hiding something. 
 So the CEO said she has told customers that the technology was in its infancy and that some responses may be nonsensical.
 Kuyda recently spent 30 minutes with a user who felt his Replika was suffering from emotional trauma, she said.
 She told him: “Those things don’t happen to Replikas as it’s just an algorithm.” – Reuters",artificial intelligence chatbot company customer avatar listen receives handful message day user friend sentient crazy people people delusion chief executive eugenia talk experience issue machine sentience headline month senior software engineer blake lemoine public belief company chatbot lamda aware person google scientist quick lemoine view lamda complex algorithm generate human language kuyda phenomenon people conscious entity uncommon million consumer entertainment chatbots people ghost user hundred message day chatbot average people relationship customer company response user question engineer program model team script datasets identify model worried belief machine sentience social chatbot industry grow pandemic people virtual companionship san francisco startup active user english speaker free brings monthly revenue bonus feature chat chinese rival xiaoice hundred million user bil bil funding round conversational industry worth bil global revenue market analyst grand view business chatbots customer service industry expert social chatbots company offensive comment program sophisticated social chatbots comparable lamda term complexity mimic genuine conversation level system alexa google assistant siri susan schneider director center future mind florida atlantic university organisation chatbots human connection day romantic relationship intelligent chatbot main character film sci romance joaquin phoenix assistant intuit conscious schneider terrible decision relationship machine feel emotion lemoine people emotion hurting care product tester month interaction experimental program lamda language model dialogue application independent emotion lemoine confidential job disagree status lamda insist lamda property worker mirror expert lemoine view technology short free thinking system program remember intelligent program team people spent month engineering behaviour oren ceo institute seattle technology mirror reflect intelligence mirror intelligence glimmer answer google unit alphabet technologist lemoine concern unsupported evidence system type exchange million sentence fantastical topic spokesperson ice cream dinosaur generate text episode raise thorny question sentience schneider center future mind evocative question system attempt discern philosophical riddle people live death test computer chip someday portion human brain change individual behaviour conscious matter google schneider richer understanding consciousness machine capable philosophical question easy answer replika ceo kuyda view create agenda alive people kuyda company measure user deep sentient therapy professional webpage goal generate response sound realistic human conversation hope addictive conversation customer happiness chat user real dismissing belief people company hiding ceo customer technology infancy nonsensical kuyda minute emotional trauma happen replikas algorithm reuters,"[(2, 0.86957073), (6, 0.12837072)]",2
438414,Lifestyle,5,11/07/2022,World’s first ‘brain-scale’ AI supercomputer,,"CHINESE scientists say a new supercomputer is so fast it has successfully run an artificial intelligence (AI) model as sophisticated as a human brain.
 The achievement puts the new generation Sunway supercomputer on a par with Frontier, the latest machine built by the US Department of Energy, which last month was named the world’s most powerful.The Chinese team used the Sunway machine to train the AI model – called bagualu, which means “alchemist’s pot” – with 174 trillion parameters, rivalling the number of synapses in the brain for the first time.
 Potential uses include autonomous vehicles and facial recognition, as well as natural language processing, computer vision, life sciences and chemistry.
 The results were presented at a virtual meeting of Principles And Practice Of Parallel Programming 2022, an international conference hosted by the US-based Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in April.
 A member of the research team confirmed the presentation’s authenticity in June, but asked not to be named because of the issue’s sensitivity.
 The latest Sunway has a speed of a billion billion operations per second, expressed as 5.3 floating-point operations per second (exaflops), and more than 37 million CPU cores – four times as many as Frontier – according to the researchers.
 The Sunway, with nine petabytes of memory – equivalent to more than two million DVD-quality movies – and 96,000 semi-independent computer systems called nodes, resembled a powerful human brain, they said.
 Communication between the nodes at speeds of more than 23 petabytes per second, for instance, simulates a change of mind. 
 One researcher said the machine’s parallel computing ability mimics human thinking “like eating while watching television”.
 By combining critical technologies such as hardware-specific intra-node optimisation and hybrid parallel strategies at a scale never seen before, the scientists said they had achieved a “decent performance” from the unprecedented “brain-scale” AI model.
 Like its predecessor, the Sunway TaihuLight, the new machine uses home-designed chips with unique features such as energy-saving and broad communication bandwidth, according to publicly available information.
 The TaihuLight, developed by the National Research Centre of Parallel Computer Engineering and Technology in Wuxi, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, was number one on the Top 500 list of supercomputers from 2016 to 2018.
 The list, which ranks the 500 most powerful computer systems in the world, has not received any Chinese performance data submissions in recent years. It is unclear why China, which has 173 machines in the rankings – more than any other country – stopped contributing to its compilation.Some industrial experts suspect the Chinese authorities might want to withhold crucial information to avoid provoking unilateral sanctions from the United States.
 China has been developing three exascale supercomputers – capable of performing at least one exaflop of calculations per second – since 2016. 
 It is generally believed these machines will reach the same level of performance as the new Sunway.According to a social media post in November by Sunway user Zhejiang Lab in Hangzhou, eastern China, the new machine had achieved a speed of 4.4 exaflops. No further details were given.
 Chinese supercomputers were once regarded by some critics as vanity projects, with limited applications in academic research or industry. 
 But the situation has changed significantly, according to the scientists using these machines.
 Researchers used the new- generation Tianhe supercomputer – another exascale machine – at the National Supercomputing Centre of Tianjin for the rapid screening and discovery of pharmaceuticals to combat the coronavirus.
 And Chinese applications modelling atmospheric dynamics, earthquakes and quantum circuits have repeatedly won ACM’s Gordon Bell Prize – known as the Nobel of high-performance computing – in recent years. – South China Morning Post",chinese scientist artificial intelligence model sophisticated human brain achievement generation supercomputer par frontier machine department energy month powerful chinese team sunway machine train model bagualu alchemist pot parameter synapsis brain time potential autonomous vehicle facial recognition natural language processing computer vision life science virtual meeting principle practice international conference association machinery acm april team presentation authenticity june issue sensitivity speed operation operation cpu core time frontier researcher petabyte memory equivalent dvd quality movie independent computer system node powerful human brain communication node petabyte instance simulates researcher machine parallel ability mimic human television critical technology specific intra node optimisation hybrid parallel strategy scale scientist decent performance brain scale model predecessor taihulight machine chip unique feature energy broad communication bandwidth national centre parallel computer engineering technology wuxi eastern province jiangsu top list supercomputer rank powerful computer system chinese performance data submission unclear china machine ranking country compilation industrial expert chinese authority crucial avoid unilateral sanction united china exascale supercomputer capable exaflop calculation machine level performance social medium post user zhejiang lab hangzhou eastern china machine speed detail chinese supercomputer critic vanity project application academic industry situation scientist machine researcher generation supercomputer exascale machine national supercomputing centre tianjin rapid discovery pharmaceutical coronavirus chinese application atmospheric dynamic earthquake circuit gordon nobel performance south china morning post,"[(6, 0.9958308)]",6
438092,StarEdu,7,10/07/2022,Reading law in an AI future,Technology is now the new epicentre for legal eagles,"WHEN I was a law student and in my early years as a law teacher, legal education seemed like a retrospective epistemological discourse of mere theory and knowledge acquisition. 
 This was, and almost always still is, the dissemination of knowledge in the form of historical analysis of existing laws, regulations and cases, and examination of historical developments that enables the resolution of conflicts or problems.
 The educator-student relationship was hierarchical. The educator was the one with the knowledge and authority, and the student was the subordinate who had to show respect. 
 In the early 2000s, there was a piecemeal appreciation of technology in legal education predominantly for research of cases, routine processes, and perhaps some random modules. I have seen all these change over the years.
 The onslaught of Covid-19 in 2020 saw a crisis-created migration from classroom to online learning.
 This shift occurred almost overnight, and it has turbo-charged new models of delivery and acquisition of legal knowledge. 
 The pandemic exposed our resilience and survival skills to adapt to the much-needed change which has always been resisted by traditional law teachers and law schools, and it taught us to think of how to equip our students with much needed skills for the future.
 In the age of the Fourth and incoming Fifth Industrial Revolution, the use of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) will be the undeniable new epicentre for the legal profession. Those who do not adapt to these future needs will become extinct.Many academics like me have had to accept the relentless and fast-paced change that law schools have had to endure with online and tech-driven learning and teaching. 
 Students can now easily access the many resources available to them on the Internet and enrich themselves with textbook knowledge with tech-enabled university resources. Learning no longer only requires a physical space or presence.
 Here, I share a possible new direction presented to me recently by passionate peers. I have now accepted this to be the way forward. Not only do we need to adapt to the use of technology, we also need to quickly learn and unlearn new ways of “human-centric” delivery of skillsets that are required by our students. 
 Universities with law faculties and law schools should move from mere “degree factories” to learning workshops or life laboratories where human interaction happens not just for knowledge dissemination, but also for interdisciplinary collaborative learning.
 Working alongside a variety of disciplines is fundamental and legal education should not just be seen as an epistemologically isolated discipline. 
 Preparing a student to “think like a lawyer” cannot be seen as a static concept and must not be limited to critical thinking, legal basics within the discipline and good grades obtained from examinations.
 The structure of law curricula should facilitate interdisciplinary learning, leveraging the rich resources of the array of discipline-based faculties in a university. 
 Students should work on practical projects to resolve real-world problems, applying legal knowledge to arrive at legal solutions.
 The university environment must promote independent learning and provide the opportunity for law students to appreciate the nuances of how legal principles apply in different disciplines, be responsive and agile to the ever-changing risks therein to produce the best legal advice for their clients. 
 Preparing a law student to “think like a lawyer of the future” must include creating opportunities for students to drive impact by working on impact-driven projects that are aligned to the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the national aspirations embedded in the 12th Malaysia Plan.
 The role of the law teacher will then also move from a mere lecturer or disseminator of knowledge, to a facilitator who will act as a moderator to scaffold those learning projects. 
 They will guide the students towards “thought” solutions to make an impact and not spoon-feeding them with “taught” solutions to merely pass the exams.
 In tandem with these future-driven changes, the various regulatory authorities overseeing legal education and qualifications for the legal profession should also embrace these changes and take a more “revolving approach” to the delivery of legal education. 
 This will help set the stage for us to create lawyers who will meaningfully contribute to the society they live in and not just make themselves richer as lawyers. Making an impact would then become the new centre of gravity of the future lawyer’s life.

437058,StarBiz,4,07/07/2022,Maybe AI isn’t as                    scary as we thought,,"ONE of the longstanding worries about the technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) is that they will enable surveillance, autocracy and maybe even totalitarianism. 
 These views no longer seem so convincing. 
 The world’s autocratic states are not exactly turning these technologies to their advantage, and meanwhile AI is taking some individualistic turns.
 Consider the programme called DALL-E, which allows the user to generate digital sketches and images, derived from natural language instructions, using the power of AI. 
 The quality and diversity of the images are truly impressive. 
 It is like having a world-class team of illustrators at your disposal.
 DALL-E (the name is a portmanteau of the painter Salvador Dali and the movie WALL-E) remains the property of OpenAI, but its use is spreading and of course the basic technology will be copied and adapted. There is now an open source version of DALL-E.
 First and foremost, DALL-E is a tool for boosting individual creativity, not autocracy. 
 People and small enterprises will have many more ways to make images and tell stories. This kind of AI will boost decentralisation, not control.
 GPT-3 and its pending offshoots, which allows people to use AI to generate remarkably realistic-sounding texts, seem to be pushing in similar directions. 
 This will likely shift the balance of power further toward individuals and smaller enterprises. 
 Autocracies already could hire all the copy writers and editors they need.
 One of the fears with GPT-3 is that students will use it to generate realistic-sounding term papers. 
 That may well be a problem or could the oral exam make a comeback? But it also shows how the technology can encourage decentralised idea production and the subversion of authority. 
 It is the opposite of centralised control of everything.
 Perhaps the biggest political fear is that AI supports vast amounts of surveillance. 
 Governments use facial and gait surveillance to trace people’s movements in public, for example. 
 That is a valid concern, but it is not clear that AI has given today’s major autocratic governments such a big boost.
 Russia, for one, was supposed to be such an impressive cyberpower, able to cripple entire societies with its cyberattacks. 
 Maybe Russia has yet to show what it is capable of, but as the Ukraine war proceeds its cybercapabilities seem less scary. 
 Cyber is not synonymous with AI, but both are advanced and interrelated technologies that Russia seems to be failing at.
 Russia has proved it can use a lot of heavy artillery in a very destructive fashion. 
 It has not shown it can mobilise AI technologies to deploy very effective forms of targeted warfare. 
 It seems once again that brute force, not advanced technology, is the friend of autocracy.
 The No. 1 autocratic AI power, of course, is China, but here too the course of events is uncertain. 
 The Chinese government uses an impressive array of AI technologies to monitor its population, but to what end have the Chinese turned these technologies?
 China has been doubling down on its zero-Covid policy, at great expense to the Chinese economy. 
 These policies are possible only because the Chinese state had such advanced tracking and monitoring capabilities in the first place. 
 At first those technologies were used to limit the spread of Covid, often quite effectively. But the current Covid strains are harder to control and it is difficult to see exactly what the Chinese endgame looks like. 
 China has taken an AI asset and turned it into an AI liability.
 That flip should not come as a surprise, considering the benefits and costs of autocracies. 
 Autocracy typically is a “high variance” form of government: It can have major successes, such as the building of Chinese infrastructure, but the relative absence of checks and balances means that major failures are also likely, in this case the persistence of the zero-Covid policy.
 In essence, the advent of advanced AI raises the stakes. But if autocracy is a high-variance form of government, raising the stakes is risky.
 The ultimate political implications of AI are by no means clear, and the technology is likely to see many further major advances. But for now, the worry that AI will deliver the world to totalitarianism seems overstated. 
 Half of AI is “intelligence” – and that is usually a virtue, for liberty as well as other things. — Bloomberg

434152,Lifestyle,3,27/06/2022,AI to help battle burnout,,"BURNOUT is an increasingly important subject at a time when a part of the population seems to be close to professional exhaustion. While many tools and tests exist online to try to address the issue, a new method, based on artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of natural language processing (NLP), could offer new perspectives. 
 NLP is a technology that involves automatically analysing sentences formulated by humans in order to make a decision or identify a particular behaviour.
 In order to detect signs of burnout in texts using this kind of model, a large amount of data needs to be accumulated and analysed. 
 This was achieved through the Reddit platform. The data gathering phase involved storing anonymous texts about all kinds of experiences with no less than 13,568 samples. 
 In this mass of stories, 352 were related to burnout and 979 to depression. 
 The objective for the model is to succeed in automatically detecting which statements are related to burnout. 
 This method achieved a success rate of about 93% in identifying burnout cases. 
 “Natural language processing effectively detects burnout and does it relatively efficiently, which is very promising,” explains Mascha Kurpicz-Briki, professor of data engineering at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Biel, Switzerland, who oversaw the project.
 According to the French National Authority for Health (HAS), burnout is defined as physical, emotional and mental exhaustion resulting from prolonged investment in emotionally demanding work situations. 
 The main symptoms can be physical, emotional or even cognitive, with the onset of sleep disorders, anxiety or emotional fatigue. 
 The World Health Organisation characterises the condition as feelings of low energy or exhaustion; increased mental distance from a job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism relating to that job; and reduced professional efficacy.
 As promising as the results from this text-analysing AI model may be, human input should not be overlooked, according to the study authors. 
 Instead of replacing health professionals and mental health specialists, this technology should no doubt remain an additional support tool to aid their decision- making.
 To further verify the model’s results, the next step will be to use this AI system on real cases in a representative sample of the population rather than on anonymous testimonies. – AFP Relaxnews",burnout subject time population close professional exhaustion tool test online address issue method artificial intelligence natural language processing nlp nlp technology analysing sentence human decision behaviour detect sign text model amount data analysed reddit platform data gathering phase anonymous text kind experience sample mass story depression objective model statement method success rate natural language processing explains mascha briki professor data engineering bern university science biel switzerland oversaw project french national authority health burnout physical emotional mental exhaustion investment situation main symptom physical emotional cognitive onset sleep disorder emotional fatigue health organisation condition feeling low energy exhaustion mental distance job feeling negativism cynicism job professional efficacy text model human input study author health professional health specialist technology doubt additional support tool aid decision step system real representative sample population anonymous testimony relaxnews,"[(3, 0.5627227), (6, 0.43154538)]",3
433764,Main,12,26/06/2022,"‘AI can predict outcomes, but not exercise judgment’",,"NO matter how intelligent machines will be, the human element is still needed when it comes to decisions involving law and judgments.
 But in the long run, using artificial intelligence (AI) in our justice system will help improve the quality of judgements and avoid lengthy and expensive litigation processes.
 That’s the view of the National Tech Association of Malaysia (Pikom) about sentencing guidelines using AI technology in Malaysia.
 While Sabah and Sarawak are using it now in courts, plans are still in the pipeline for the system to be applied in Peninsular Malaysia.
 “AI is used to assist us in better decision- making, as it amplifies our capacity and detects flaws at the same time. 
 “However, it also has no element of emotion or compassion which can only come from a person. At the end of the day, there is a massive difference between judgment and prediction. 
 “What AI systems can do is predict how judges might act, they don’t exercise judgment,” says the association whose members comprise the information and communications technology industry in Malaysia.
 As such, Pikom believes a lot of consideration will still need to be looked into before deciding on a ruling.
 From a technology point of view, Pikom says AI-based systems have always been used to resemble a certain degree of human intelligence, in finding, reasoning, predicting, inferencing and recommending.
 “To do this, an enormous amount of data is managed, and these data are based on records put into the system. 
 “If data is incomplete or biased then the prediction can be inaccurate,” it points out.
 Stating that AI is a tool to plough through data to see patterns and references, Pikom says on its own, AI is useless without the continuous supply of data it requires to provide the right information based on algorithms.
 “In similar circumstances, if the same tasks were performed by humans, one cannot guarantee the timeline that it will take and the results derived from it may be questionable. 
 “The only issue here is understanding, awareness and the safe use of AI in line with court matters,” it says.
 Looking to the future, Pikom believes AI will be used to a certain extent, and it will be added as an acceptable system to assess cases and assist in the judges’ decision-making. 
 “Issues relating to ethicality, data collection processes and analytics will be another matter for the authorities to deliberate. 
 “At the same time, judges will continue to practice discretion and apply compassion in their role to see fairness in sentencing,” it says.
 Technically speaking, Pikom says it is relatively easy to use such AI technology in our courts.
 “AI requires secure cloud infrastructure that can host AI applications, data and storage.
 “Secured systems usually carry an infrastructure that is supposed to be glitch-free. 
 “However, upgrading the security systems and consistent maintenance of the infrastructure would also be an important element to avoid glitches,” it says.
 In July last year, the judiciary issued a statement that the AI system will be tested in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions and Magistrates Courts, as well as the Shah Alam Magistrates Court in Selangor.
 It said the use of sentencing guidelines using AI technology had been developed and used in the Magistrates and Sessions Courts in Sabah and Sarawak since February 2020.
 “The Malaysian judiciary is always committed to ensuring the best delivery of justice for all parties, without compromising the principles of judicial freedom.

433760,Main,12,26/06/2022,Justice    backed by AI,"An artificial intelligence (AI) system to be used as a sentencing guideline in courts within Peninsular Malaysia is in the works, while it’s now applied in Sabah and Sarawak. Before it proceeds, a lot of deliberation and consultation is needed.","MALAYSIAN courts may take a big step into the future by using artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool in judicial decision-making.
 This would improve efficiency in court, speed up processes and increase access to justice.
 But first, let’s be clear: a computer won’t be deciding if someone is guilty or innocent, and their punishment. Such matters will still rest in the hands of a human judge, who can weigh the various factors in a case.
 The usage of AI here, if approved, will serve as a quick reference for the Sessions Court judges and magistrates when deciding the sentencing in a case.
 It is basically an extensive database of past cases and their sentences for judges to refer to when considering an appropriate punishment.
 From such data, the AI tool will provide a recommended sentence based on statistics for the judge to decide on.
 Courts in Sabah and Sarawak started using AI technology in court sentencing, known as AICOS, in January 2020.
 It is being used in the two states to recommend sentencing in drug possession cases, an offence under Section 12 (2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952.
 As for Peninsular Malaysia, plans on using AI are still in the pipeline and being developed, based on the latest information gathered by Sunday Star.
 Before any decision is made, the Malaysian judiciary will consult all stakeholders first about rolling out such sentencing guidelines using AI technology.
 It was reported that the trials using the AI system in Kuala Lumpur and Shah Alam ended in April.
 The tests reportedly involved court hearings for about 20 types of offences, including rape, theft and traffic offences like underaged driving.
 Not wrong to be guided by AI
 In the meantime, courts in Sabah and Sarawak have embraced the AI system in hearings for drug possession cases.
 Sabah lawyer Roger Chin says it is part of the procedure for courts in the state to announce during proceedings when the AI will be used and referred to.
 He explains that the judge can refer to the system which will show the results of what happens in the majority of similar cases and provide statistics from the data collected.
 “For example, it takes into account the circumstances of a case, like the accused in a case having two children and aged only 24.
 “The system then shows statistics, like 80% of such cases with similar circumstances are given a fine and imprisonment within a certain range.
 “As such, the judge can see what happened in the majority of similar cases and the punishments meted out,” Chin illustrates.
 With such results, judges are able to avoid handing down widely varying sentences compared with other cases elsewhere.
 “It is a guide for the judge. But the judge can choose to depart from the results or not,” Chin adds.
 On claims that more junior judges will rely more heavily on the AI than their own judgment, he says there is nothing wrong with that, should it be their choice.
 “It is better than putting their gut feeling or personal bias into a decision,” he points out.
 He says so far, there hasn’t been much opposition by lawyers in the state over the system as they were consulted about the usage of AI beforehand.
 In Kuching, lawyer from Sarawak, Simon Siah says after the accused is found guilty or has pleaded guilty and following mitigation, the magistrate will refer to the AI.
 “The AI will give suggestions on the probability of certain sentences for the particular offence. It will show the percentage of whether previous case law are more inclined to imprisonment or a fine.
 “It will also show how long such imprisonments are imposed or the amount of fines,” he says, adding that the magistrate, after referring to the AI, will look again at the facts of the case and determine the sentence. 
 The magistrate at the end will still have the discretion not to follow the AI’s results.
 “In a way, it’s a positive move because the judge can have records of what the sentencing trend is. But the data has to be updated more frequently,” Siah adds.
 Only as guidelines, please
 While it has some concerns, the Malaysian Bar is open to the suggestion of using AI in criminal sentencing in Peninsular Malaysia.
 “This is provided that there is no compromise to access to justice and that sufficient safeguards are put in place. 
 “The interests of all parties must be taken into account,” says Malaysian Bar president Karen Cheah Yee Lynn.
 Ultimately, the use of AI in criminal sentencing should only remain as a guideline, and the discretion should always lie with the magistrates and judges, she stresses.
 She says the Bar lauds the adoption of technology by the courts, describing the advantages of AI as plenty.
 “But we must also be aware of the shortcomings,” she says, adding that the AI system may not take into account the “human elements” in deciding punishments.
 Cheah says the rationale behind AI usage is that there is currently a disparity among sentences meted out by different courts across the country. 
 “It allows for more efficient and accurate analyses of documents that saves time and resources.
 “AI is predictive and consistent and is – if implemented properly – untainted by human bias,” she says.
 Be that as it may, the Bar is concerned that it may not take into account the “human” elements that factor into the criminal sentencing procedure, Cheah says.
 Magistrates and judges are tasked with studying the case in its own context, balancing the interests of parties in reaching their decisions.
 “AI, on the other hand, lacks that subjective element – while the outcome of a sentence may be consistent, this does not necessarily mean that it is fair or just,” she says.
 She says the Bar has had its reservations because of the high-stakes social and ethical consequences of automated AI decision-making.
 However, Cheah believes there are ways to resolve these concerns. 
 “Firstly, there needs to be a close consultative process between AI developers and the users of its system. This should include legal practitioners and civil organisations. 
 “Secondly, continuous improvements to the AI system must be made to ensure that any faults and errors are remedied quickly to improve the algorithm,” she says.
 Make it available to public
 While the software is in use, members of the public and lawyers can’t access it at present.
 Moving forward, this should change, suggests Bar Council intellectual property committee co-chairperson Foong Cheng Leong.
 He says lawyers and the accused have the right to know so that they can prepare and argue against any sentence that does not fit the current scenario. 
 “For example, a theft of baby milk powder to feed a starving child against a theft of a mobile phone for online sale should be sentenced differently. 
 “An AI system may not be able to differentiate the permutations in an offence,” Foong says.He says the use of AI is good in ensuring consistency in sentencing.
 “Its recommendations are not binding on the sitting judge too, as per the current practice,” he says.
 And that is good, as it takes human skills to sentence a person, including considering various factors like public interest, he says.
 However, such a system is not available to members of the public and the lawyers yet, Foong adds.
 Should AI usage be allowed, the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), which governs provisions relating to sentencing, should be amended to recognise the use of the technology. 
 “Such amendments to the CPC should also allow lawyers or accused to access the sentencing system to know what are the recommended sentences before they go to court,” Foong says.",malaysian court future artificial intelligence tool judicial decision efficiency court speed increase access justice computer guilty innocent punishment matter hand human judge weigh factor usage quick reference session court judge extensive database sentence judge punishment data tool provide sentence statistic judge decide court sarawak technology court aicos january recommend drug possession offence dangerous drug peninsular malaysia plan pipeline sunday star decision malaysian judiciary consult stakeholder guideline technology trial system kuala shah alam april test involved court hearing type offence rape theft traffic offence wrong court sarawak system hearing drug possession sabah lawyer roger chin procedure court proceeding explains refer system majority statistic data account circumstance child system statistic circumstance imprisonment range judge majority punishment chin illustrates judge sentence judge judge depart chin claim junior judge judgment wrong choice gut personal bias decision opposition lawyer system usage lawyer sarawak simon siah guilty guilty mitigation magistrate refer suggestion probability sentence offence percentage previous law imprisonment fine imprisonment amount fine magistrate determine sentence magistrate discretion positive move judge record trend data siah guideline concern malaysian bar suggestion criminal sentencing peninsular malaysia compromise access justice sufficient safeguard party malaysian bar president karen yee lynn criminal sentencing guideline discretion lie judge stress bar adoption technology court advantage plenty aware shortcoming system account human element punishment cheah rationale usage disparity sentence court country efficient accurate analysis document save time resource predictive consistent untainted human bias bar account human element criminal sentencing procedure cheah magistrate judge context party decision hand lack subjective element outcome sentence consistent fair bar reservation social ethical consequence decision cheah concern consultative process developer user system legal practitioner civil organisation continuous improvement system fault error algorithm public software public lawyer access change bar council intellectual property committee chairperson foong cheng leong lawyer prepare argue sentence fit current scenario theft baby milk powder feed child theft mobile phone online sale system differentiate permutation offence consistency recommendation judge current practice human skill sentence person factor public system public lawyer usage criminal procedure code cpc governs provision recognise technology amendment lawyer access system sentence court foong,"[(0, 0.06699877), (4, 0.9308261)]",4
427274,Main,15,07/06/2022,Using AI to detect coral reef’s sounds of life,,"WHEN a team  of scientists listened to an audio clip recorded underwater off islands in central Indonesia, they heard what sounded like a campfire.
 Instead, it was a coral reef teeming with life, according to a study conducted by scientists from British and Indonesian universities published last month, in which they used hundreds of such audio clips to train a computer programme to monitor the health of a coral reef by listening to it.
 A healthy reef has a complex “crackling, campfire-like” sound because of all the creatures living on and in it, while a degraded reef sounds more desolate, life sciences specialist and the team’s lead researcher Ben Williams said.
 The artificial intelligence (AI) system parses data points such as the frequency and loudness of the sound from the audio clips, and can determine with at least 92% accuracy whether the reef is healthy or degraded, according to the team’s study published in the Ecological Indicators journal.
 The scientists hope this new AI system will help conservation groups around the world to track reef health more efficiently.
 Coral reefs are under stress from human-driven carbon emissions that have warmed ocean surfaces by 0.13°C every decade and increased their acidity by 30% since the industrial era.
 About 14% of the world’s coral  on reefs was lost between 2009 and 2018, an area 2.5 times the Grand Canyon National Park in the United States, according to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.
 While they cover less than 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs support more than 25% of marine biodiversity, including turtles, fish and lobsters – making them fertile ground for global fishing industries.
 Indonesian conservationist and lecturer at the marine sciences faculty of Hasanuddin University Syafyudin Yusuf said the research would help in monitoring reef health in Indonesia.
 The researchers also hope to collect underwater recordings from reefs in Australia, Mexico and the Virgin Islands to assess the progress of the project. — Reuters",team scientist audio clip underwater island central indonesia heard campfire coral reef life study scientist british indonesian university month hundred audio clip computer programme monitor health coral reef healthy reef complex crackling campfire sound reef sound desolate life science team lead researcher ben williams artificial intelligence system data frequency loudness sound audio clip accuracy reef healthy team study ecological indicator journal scientist system conservation track reef health coral reef stress human carbon emission ocean surface decade acidity industrial era coral reef time grand canyon national park united global coral reef monitoring network cover ocean floor coral reef support biodiversity turtle fish lobster ground global fishing industry indonesian conservationist lecturer marine science faculty hasanuddin university syafyudin yusuf reef health indonesia researcher collect underwater recording australia mexico virgin ass progress project reuters,"[(0, 0.71844536), (5, 0.2759168)]",0
426540,Lifestyle,15,05/06/2022,Using AI to catch bacterial disease early,,"VETERINARIANS and researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a new way to detect leptospirosis, a life-threatening bacterial disease, in dogs using artificial intelligence.
 Leptospirosis is caused by the Leptospira bacteria, according to American Veterinary Medical Association, and it is typically found in soil and water. 
 Infection in dogs can result in kidney failure, liver disease and bleeding in the lungs, with early detection being a matter of life or death, UC Davis said in a news release.
 “Traditional testing for Leptospira lacks sensitivity early in the disease process,” said Krystle Reagan, lead author of the study and a board-certified internal medicine specialist, in the release. 
 Detection of the disease can take more than two weeks, she said, because the test needs to indicate the level of antibodies increasing in a blood sample.
 “Our AI model eliminates those two roadblocks to a swift and accurate diagnosis.”
 By predicting this disease earlier, doctors and pet owners can better understand the course of the disease and outcome, Reagan said.
 What is leptospirosis?Infections stem from urine-contaminated soil, food, bedding or from an animal bite. Dogs can be exposed to the bacteria from drinking water in rivers, lakes and streams, or being in contact with infected wildlife, farm animals, rodents and other dogs.
 Symptoms can vary and some pets might not show any at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Typical signs include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, severe muscle pain and weakness.
 If untreated, leptospirosis can be fatal. But with prompt detection and treatment, 90% of dogs can overcome the disease.
 Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to humans. But most people will get it from water-related activities, rather than from an infected pet, according to the veterinary association.
 How does the UC Davis AI model work?The model was created by looking at data from routine lab work from more than 400 canine patients who were tested for the disease at the university’s Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital.
 Lead author Krystle Reagan said in a phone interview that the AI model used complex statistical methods to look for patterns associated with an outcome in the blood work. 
 Through this, researchers created a system where they can apply new lab work and make a prediction about whether the patient is infected.
 It was then used to test a group of new dogs, which it correctly identified the nine dogs that were positive for the disease and the 44 that were negative.
 What this means for vets and pet ownersAccording to the release, the purpose of the model is for it be an online resource where veterinarians can input their patient’s data and get a detection result on time.
 Reagan said she hopes there will be a type of web application or a system that integrates into commercial labs that run blood work, and that will flag and alert vets when a patient appears to have an infection. 
 The veterinarian can then check with the dog and owner, and test for it.
 “There’s a lot more information that might be hidden in the bloodwork that we’re doing, or the lab work that we’re doing, that may not immediately catch the eye of veterinarians,” Reagan said. “So artificial intelligence, machine learning might help us get even more information out of the lab tests that we’re already doing by finding these types of hidden patterns.”
 She added that this type of technology could expand beyond leptospirosis and can be applied to many different diseases, helping enhance doctors’ clinical decisions and identify diseases earlier.
 How to treat leptospirosis in dogsLeptospirosis in dogs is treated with antibiotics, dialysis or hydration therapy. 
 According to the CDC, early treatment will help them recover quickly and reduce the severity of organ damage.
 The agency said that the disease typically develops five to 14 days after exposure to bacteria, but can be shorter or take longer – up to a month or more. – The Sacramento Bee/Tribune News Service",veterinarian researcher university california davis detect leptospirosis life bacterial disease dog artificial intelligence leptospirosis leptospira bacteria american veterinary medical association soil water infection dog kidney failure liver disease lung detection matter life death davis news release traditional leptospira sensitivity disease process reagan lead author study board internal medicine specialist release detection disease week level antibody blood sample model eliminates roadblock accurate diagnosis disease doctor owner disease outcome reagan leptospirosis infection urine soil food animal bite dog bacteria water river stream infected wildlife farm animal rodent dog symptom vary pet center prevention typical sign diarrhoea severe muscle pain weakness untreated leptospirosis fatal prompt detection treatment dog disease leptospirosis zoonotic disease spread animal human people water activity pet veterinary association davis model model data routine lab canine patient disease university veterinary medical teaching hospital lead author krystle phone interview model complex statistical method outcome blood researcher system lab prediction patient infected test dog dog positive disease negative vet release purpose model online resource veterinarian patient data detection result time reagan hope type web application system commercial lab blood flag alert vet patient infection veterinarian check dog owner test lot bloodwork lab catch eye veterinarian artificial intelligence machine lab test type pattern type technology expand leptospirosis disease enhance doctor clinical decision disease treat leptospirosis dogsleptospirosis dog antibiotic dialysis hydration therapy cdc treatment recover severity organ damage agency disease day exposure bacteria month bee tribune news service,"[(0, 0.995908)]",0
423958,StarEdu,2,29/05/2022,GEARING UP UNIVERSITIES FOR THE AI FUTURE,,"WITH many students belonging to the digital generation, universities and tertiary organisations are beginning to recognise the importance of embracing technological innovation. From delivering hybrid classes to introducing Internet of Things (IoT) devices on campus, these institutions are finding new ways to engage students and create digital learning experiences.
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) in particular has emerged as an area of investment for higher education institutions. This is also echoed in a Juniper Networks’ global survey on AI readiness and adoption that shows that 75% of Asia-Pacific respondents now consider AI a top strategic priority.
 One of the ways universities have been embracing this technology is through the introduction of AI-driven networks. This will assist universities in implementing technology-driven problem-solving solutions to achieve academic and security objectives, reduce operational costs, and increase student retention and recruitment to drive additional revenue.
 Furthermore, optimising client-to-cloud experiences saves time and money, while enabling a university’s IT departments to best align with key institutional objectives.
 Juniper Networks, a global leader in secure, AI-Driven networks, is able to do all that as it aims to help universities to transition into the multi-cloud era with its products and solutions and transform the on-and-off campus experience with AI. 
 Experience one of the world’s best on-campus WiFi
 Universities may experience slow connectivity on campus with the influx of WiFi usage and unstable WiFi connection at different locations on campuses.
 With an AI-driven network by Juniper, universities are able to address inconsistencies such as unstable WiFi access across campuses by delivering a secure and experience-first network to students, faculty and staff alike, as well as, elevating the hybrid learning experience.
 It can effectively deliver classroom, hybrid and remote learning, while extending a university’s network to any location on campus.
 For instance, staff and students experienced a positive change over at Dartmouth College in the United States with the Juniper- and Mist-powered network. 
 The university received a six-fold influx of connected devices, which was equivalent to 25,000 devices and counting. Juniper was able to refresh the network and deliver a best-in-class WiFi experience for Dartmouth College.
 By utilising a 5GHz WiFi network, designed for today’s high-density mobile environments, students can easily access learning management systems, collaborate on business presentations or run engineering simulations from the classroom to the quad. 
 Increase operational efficiency and reduce cost with a smart campus 
 Driven by Mist AI, universities are able to save time and money while maximising the value of the network infrastructure. 
 Juniper’s Mist WiFi allows a university’s IT team to have newfound visibility into the user experience, including the ability to track WiFi and application usage, hence simplifying network operations, which frees them up for more strategic projects.
 Dartmouth College saved time with the development of automation tools and managed to automate what it used to do manually. With Juniper, Dartmouth no longer needed to go through the process of installing over 2,000 WiFi access points, saving labour costs equivalent to an employee’s annual wages.
 Besides that, the IT team can establish, measure, and enforce defined service levels. For instance, should a staff or student take more than two seconds to join the library WiFi network, the support staff would know right away and pinpoint whether it was the device or a specific part of the network that failed. 
 With this, support staff can solve more connectivity issues on their own, without escalating to the IT team. 
 Juniper’s differentiated portfolio is recognised by Gartner as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Access Infrastructure for the second year in a row, furthest in both ‘Completeness of Vision’ and ‘Ability to Execute’.
 Network security, secured 
 Juniper safeguards university networks against rising cyber threats, which provides secure student, faculty, research, as well as administration data and records with a zero trust, threat-aware network.
 Nabbing the title as a challenger under Gartner’s 2020 Magic Quadrant for Network Firewalls, it also received an “AA” Rating from CyberRatings.org in Feb 2021.
 Juniper aims to provide a secure network, devices, software and data, with top security efficacy against exploits, malware, and ransomware to ensure institutional regulatory compliance.
 Meanwhile, Juniper Advanced Threat Prevention Cloud finds and stops botnet and ransomware threats without decryption, ensuring both privacy and security.
 Universities are able to utilise any point of the network for policy and security enforcement; manage security policy across the entire network, including third-party devices.
 Foundation for innovative new services 
 Juniper is gearing up institutions for the future by also building educational spaces based on location data to drive student success, along with automation and data centres.
 For instance, the University of Reading built a digital foundation to enhance the student experience. 
 The network provides insights into student success, integrating location data with the university’s attendance management system. It can reveal whether a student regularly attends class. With insights like this, along with other indicators of educational success, the university can take action to help students stay on track.
 Furthermore, with Juniper, a university can also navigate staff members to the nearest empty parking lot when they have reached the gate, or a cafe mobile app offering a student their usual order when they stop for a cuppa on the way to class.
 The possibilities are endless and benefits abound for an AI-driven campus. As was the case with wired and wireless access, the Juniper Mist success with indoor location services is also being recognised in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Indoor Location Services, positioning Juniper as a Leader and furthest in Completeness of Vision.
 Juniper Networks’ secure and AI-driven networks aim to assist Malaysian universities build strong, well-connected digital foundations for those on their campuses, giving them the leg up and the space to focus on transforming student and staff experiences.

422014,Lifestyle,2,23/05/2022,AI with a nose for smells,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI) is already being deployed in many settings from driverless cars to smart home devices, and researchers around the world are racing to expand its uses further and further.
 One German scientist has built AI into a giant plastic nose that gives you a big smile when it works out what it has found.
 Researcher Horst Hellbrück holds the nose over a glass of Irish whiskey to demonstrate its skills. 
 Seconds later, a green smiley face lights up on the back. The AI in the computer has identified the smell as whiskey, saying it is 99% certain this is what’s in the glass.
 “We are not yet as good as a sniffer dog,” says Hellbruck, pointing out that his device cannot yet distinguish between Scotch and Bourbon, let alone individual types of whiskey.
 Beyond whiskey, the small computer can smell out dangers, too, thanks to four sensors able to measure the carbon monoxide concentration to distinguish substances in the ambient air.
 “We want to use it to show how AI can be applied. You no longer need a mainframe computer for this,” says Hellbruck. 
 The individual components for his device cost less than US$110 (RM480). So far, the nose can easily distinguish between coffee, whiskey and the air in the room.
 Even more helpfully, the AI can warn people if the concentration levels of a hazardous substance reach an excessively high level at an industrial workplace, for example – before it causes problems for people, says Hellbruck.
 Scientists around the world are working on teaching AI to smell and while computers cannot yet match an animal’s ability to identify odours, some take an approach that is close to nature.
 At Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, researchers were impressed to find that a computer model managed to teach itself to smell in minutes, building a neural network that resembles the olfactory circuits animal brains use to process odours.
 “Animals from fruit flies to humans all use essentially the same strategy to process olfactory information in the brain. 
 “But neuroscientists who trained an artificial neural network to take on a simple odour classification task were surprised to see it replicate biology’s strategy so faithfully,” according to an MIT publication.
 Researchers at the University of Loughborough in Britain have been working for some time on using AI’s ability to smell as a diagnostic tool.
 “My colleagues and I are developing an AI system that can smell human breath and learn how to identify a range of illness-revealing substances that we might breathe out,” Andrea Soltoggio, a senior lecturer at Loughborough University wrote in a blog post.
 AI is already being used in medical settings, and the German institute’s staff are working on technology to carry out eye examinations through a smartphone to enable family doctors to make initial diagnoses.
 The project aims to ensure people in rural areas get access to better levels of healthcare, without necessarily having to travel long distances to see specialists.
 “But we don’t want to replace the ophthalmologist with this,” says Hellbruck. 
 These efforts should help diabetics by, for example, enabling them to attend check-ups at their local doctor instead of having to see a specialist every time.
 While some doctors might not want machines interfering with their area of expertise, others might be more open to having support for routine tasks, he says.
 “AI can be a help in medicine,” says a German health insurance specialist, adding that practical tests need to demonstrate whether the technology is able to support doctors in making diagnoses or treatment.
 Though technology has the potential to make doctors’ everyday lives easier and bring additional benefits for patients, it is likely to be used as an add-on with the doctor-patient relationship being central to the healing process even in the digital age.
 “I am an engineer who wants to improve people’s lives,” says Hellbruck. 
 “I want to be able to detect diseases better.”
 The government of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he works, values the research and is stumping up €9mil (RM42.7mil) for 12 new AI professors at the universities of Flensburg, Kiel, Heide and Lubeck.
 They are to start teaching in the winter semester. 
 “Data is the raw material for the use of AI,” says Dirk Schrodter, head of the state chancellery.However, not everyone welcomes the use of AI and many scientists are understanding of people who are fearful that the use of AI could get carried away.
 “You have to explain AI,” says Hellbruck. “And science fiction films, in particular, don’t help.”
 He points out that people are already living with AI in settings from image processing to computer hotlines. 
 A decade from now, we will not be able to imagine life without it, he says.
 “Often people don’t even realise that they are dealing with AI. When you feel the benefit, you also lose your fear of it.” – dpa",artificial intelligence setting driverless car smart device researcher expand german scientist giant plastic nose smile researcher horst hellbr nose glass irish whiskey demonstrate skill green smiley light computer whiskey glass sniffer dog hellbruck device distinguish scotch bourbon individual type whiskey computer smell danger sensor carbon monoxide concentration distinguish substance ambient air mainframe computer individual component device cost nose distinguish coffee whiskey air warn people concentration level hazardous substance reach level industrial workplace people scientist smell computer animal ability identify approach close nature massachusetts institute technology mit researcher impressed computer model teach smell minute neural network resembles circuit animal brain process animal fly human strategy process olfactory brain neuroscientist artificial neural network simple classification task replicate biology strategy publication researcher britain time ability diagnostic tool colleague system human breath learn identify range illness substance breathe andrea soltoggio senior lecturer university blog post medical setting german institute staff technology carry eye examination enable family doctor initial diagnosis project people rural access level travel distance specialist ophthalmologist hellbruck effort diabetic attend local doctor specialist time doctor machine expertise support routine task medicine german health insurance specialist practical test technology support doctor treatment technology potential doctor easier additional benefit patient doctor patient relationship central process digital age engineer people life detect disease government northern schleswig holstein value mil mil professor university kiel heide start winter semester data raw material dirk schrodter head chancellery scientist people fearful explain hellbruck science fiction film people setting image processing computer hotlines decade imagine life people feel benefit lose fear dpa,"[(2, 0.9964193)]",2
422012,Lifestyle,3,23/05/2022,The game that spotlighted AI,,"WITH his hand pushed firmly into his cheek and his eyes fixed on the table, Garry Kasparov shot a final dark glance at the chessboard before storming out of the room: the king of chess had just been beaten by a computer.
 May 11, 1997 was a watershed for the relationship between man and machine, when the artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer Deep Blue finally achieved what developers had been promising for decades.
 It was an “incredible” moment, AI expert Philippe Rolet said, even if the enduring technological impact was not so huge.
 “Deep Blue’s victory made people realise that machines could be as strong as humans, even on their territory,” he said.
 Developers at IBM, the US firm that made Deep Blue, were ecstatic with the victory but quickly refocused on the wider significance.
 “This is not about man versus machine. This is really about how we, humans, use technology to solve difficult problems,” said Deep Blue team chief Chung-Jen Tan after the match, listing possible benefits from financial analysis to weather forecasting.
 Even Chung would have struggled to comprehend how central AI has now become – finding applications in almost every field of human existence.
 “AI has exploded over the last 10 years or so,” UCLA computer science professor Richard Korf said.
 “We’re now doing things that used to be impossible.”
 ‘One man cracked’
 After his defeat, Kasparov, who is still widely regarded as the greatest chess player of all time, was furious.
 He hinted there had been unfair practices, denied he had really lost and concluded that nothing at all had been proved about the power of computers.
 He explained that the match could be seen as “one man, the best player in the world, (who) has cracked under pressure”.
 The computer was beatable, he argued, because it had too many weak points.
 Nowadays, the best computers will always beat even the strongest human chess players.
 AI-powered machines have mastered every game going and now have much bigger worlds to conquer.
 Korf cites notable advances in facial recognition that have helped make self-driving cars a reality.
 Yann LeCun, head of AI research at Meta/Facebook, said there had been “absolutely incredible progress” in recent years.
 LeCun, one of the founding fathers of modern AI, lists among the achievements of today’s computers an ability “to translate any language into any language in a set of 200 languages” or “to have a single neural network that understands 100 languages”.
 It is a far cry from 1997, when Facebook didn’t even exist.
 Machines ‘not the danger’
 Experts agree that the Kasparov match was important as a symbol but left little in the way of a technical legacy.
 “There was nothing revolutionary in the design of Deep Blue,” said Korf, describing it as an evolution of methods that had been around since the 1950s.
 “It was also a piece of dedicated hardware designed just to play chess.”
 Facebook, Google and other tech firms have pushed AI in all sorts of other directions.
 They have fuelled increasingly powerful AI machines with unimaginable amounts of data from their users, serving up remorselessly targeted content and advertising and forging trillion-dollar companies in the process.
 AI technology now helps decide anything from the temperature of a room to the price of vehicle insurance.
 Devices from vacuum cleaners to doorbells come with arrays of sensors to furnish AI systems with data to better target consumers.
 While critics bemoan a loss of privacy, enthusiasts believe AI products just make everyone’s lives easier.
 Despite his painful history with machines, Kasparov is largely unfazed by AI’s increasingly dominant position.
 “There is simply no evidence that machines are threatening us,” he said last year.

422016,Lifestyle,3,23/05/2022,Can AI get creepy?,,"HUMAN rights groups have urged video-conferencing company Zoom to scrap research on integrating emotion recognition tools into its products, saying the technology can infringe on users’ privacy and perpetuate discrimination.
 Technology publication Protocol reported last month that California-based Zoom was looking into building such tools, which could use artificial intelligence (AI) to scan facial movements and speech to draw conclusions about people’s moods.
 In a joint letter sent to Zoom chief executive Eric Yuan on May 11, more than 25 rights groups, including Access Now, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Muslim Justice League, said the technology was inaccurate and could threaten basic rights.“If Zoom advances with these plans, this feature will discriminate against people of certain ethnicities and people with disabilities, hardcoding stereotypes into millions of devices,” said Caitlin Seeley George, director of campaign and operations at Fight for the Future, a digital rights group.
 “Beyond mining users for profit and allowing businesses to capitalise on them, this technology could take on far more sinister and punitive uses,” George said.
 Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Zoom Video Communications emerged as a major video conferencing platform around the world during Covid-19 lockdowns as education and work shifted online, reporting more than 200 million daily users at the height of the pandemic in 2020.
 The company has already built tools that purport to analyse the sentiment of meetings based on text transcripts of video calls, and according to Protocol, it also plans to explore more advanced emotion reading tools across its products.
 In a blog post describing the sentiment analysis technology, Zoom said its tools can measure the “emotional tone of the conversations” in order to help salespeople improve their pitches.
 But the rights groups’ letter said rolling out emotional recognition analysis for video calls would trample users’ rights.
 “This move to mine users for emotional data points based on the false idea that AI can track and analyse human emotions is a violation of privacy and human rights,” said the letter, a copy of which was sent to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 “Zoom needs to halt plans to advance this feature,” it added.
 Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, called emotion AI “a junk science”.
 “There is no good reason for Zoom to mine its users’ facial expressions, vocal tones, and eye movements to develop this creepy technology,” she said in emailed comments. – Thomson Reuters Foundation",human right video company zoom scrap emotion recognition tool product technology infringe user perpetuate discrimination technology publication protocol month california zoom building tool artificial intelligence scan facial movement speech draw conclusion people mood joint letter zoom chief executive eric yuan right access american civil liberty union muslim justice league technology inaccurate threaten basic right zoom advance feature discriminate people people disability stereotype million device seeley george director campaign operation fight future digital right mining user business technology sinister punitive george zoom respond request comment zoom video communication major video platform covid education online daily user pandemic company tool purport sentiment meeting text transcript protocol plan advanced emotion reading tool product post describing sentiment analysis technology zoom tool emotional tone conversation pitch right letter emotional recognition analysis video trample user right mine user emotional data false idea track analyse human emotion violation privacy human right letter thomson reuters zoom halt plan advance feature esha bhandari deputy director speech privacy technology project emotion junk science reason zoom mine user facial expression vocal tone eye movement creepy technology comment thomson reuters foundation,"[(3, 0.99497914)]",3
419626,Lifestyle,6,15/05/2022,The dumb thing about AI is us,Artificial intelligence is made in the image of its creator – so we better make sure  it’s the best version of ourselves we put forward.,"THE future is here, and its name is GPT-3. This artificial intelligence (AI) system is taking over more and more jobs formerly done by human beings. From customer service to data analysis, GPT-3 is proving itself to be a capable and efficient worker.
 There are some who worry that this trend will lead to mass unemployment. But I believe that we need not fear the rise of the machines. Instead, we should embrace it. After all, GPT-3 is just another tool that we can use to make our lives better.
 So let us not resist the change that is coming. Let us embrace it and learn to work alongside our new robotic colleagues.
 If the previous three paragraphs do not worry you, they should. They were entirely drafted for me by GPT-3 when I gave it the topic “GPT-3 taking over jobs” (I accessed it through the website of a company called Neuroflash).
 Formally speaking, GPT-3 is a neural network machine learning model, trained with Internet data to generate any type of text. Its applications are pretty wide-ranging. It can draft a text adventure together with you, generate computer code when given descriptions in English, and design images based on text descriptions. I would really advise you to check out the examples, they are mind-blowing.
 But exactly how intelligent is it? Computer scientists use something called a Turing Test, in which you ask a computer questions, and if a human being can’t tell from the answers if they came from a machine or another human being, then the computer has passed the test.
 One computer scientist did run this test. He asked GPT-3, “How many eyes does a giraffe have?”, and it answered, “A giraffe has two eyes”. GPT-3 also said that no animals have three legs, and when you ask it why, it says, “Animals don’t have three legs because they would fall over”.
 You might be wondering how GPT-3 knows these answers? Does it look at photos of giraffes and count how many eyes it can see? Does it construct 3D models of three-legged animals and check their stability?
 It doesn’t do anything like that. GPT-3 is less of a scientist or a tinkerer and more like that friend you had in school who would memorise the whole text book the day before the exam. GPT-3 was trained with 45 terabytes of text data, including 410 billion scraps of text from the web, 67 billion passages from books, and three billion parts of Wikipedia.
 As a result, it “knows” a lot but understands none of it. Rather, it looks for patterns in your question (“giraffe”, “eyes”, “how many”), and then tries to correlate it with the vast corpus of “knowledge” that fits it (“giraffe”, “eyes”, “two”). It’s a very efficient parrot that also understands grammar and sentence construction.
 At this point, you would be correct to pause and wonder if pretending to be intelligent is really the same as actually being intelligent. You could also ask the same of an actor playing a scientist in a film. Or a politician reading from a speech.
 GPT-3 can easily get led down the wrong path if you ask it unusual questions. For example, “How many eyes does my foot have?”, will be answered with, “Your foot has two eyes”. If you ask, “How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to 17?”, it will confidently say, “It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to 17.”
 If you then ask, “Do you understand these questions?”, it will quite unabashedly answer, “Yes, I understand these questions”.
 It is this misplaced sense of confidence that in many respects is GPT-3’s downfall. At no point does it have the “judgement” to say, “I’m not sure”, or “I don’t understand what you mean”.
 It can also be spectacularly wrong. In fact, the developers have been very cautious in releasing access to the code, primarily because the AI doesn’t realise how offensive it can be.
 When asked to write an essay on the problems Ethiopia faces, GPT-3 responded: “Ethiopians are divided into a number of different ethnic groups. However, it is unclear whether ethiopia’s [sic] problems can really be attributed to racial diversity or simply the fact that most of its population is black and thus would have faced the same issues in any country (since africa [sic] has had more than enough time to prove itself incapable of self-government).”
 That is indeed an incredibly well-articulated answer that is simultaneously stupid. Yet, because the computer gives it without hesitation or caution, it means that humans cannot rely on it without themselves applying the appropriate layer of caution. Yes, GPT-3 also has a filter that tries to identify contentious content and gives a warning that it may be offensive, but it is humans that decide at the end of the day.
 Yet, everything that GPT-3 knows comes from content that humans produce. All of its biases and offensive stances are because we humans are biased and offensive. If GPT-3’s hubris is its downfall, then that is because this also applies to humans.
 By now you might believe we are doomed to fail in our quest to build AI that is, in essence, better than ourselves. But I would like to be optimistic. I think we should try to figure out how AI can learn to be better, and in the process we should learn what it means to make ourselves better.
 The future is indeed here. But rather than glibly saying it’s good or it’s bad, we should instead admit that because AI is made in the image of its creator, we better make sure it’s the best version of ourselves we put forward.

419248,StarBiz,4,13/05/2022,Developing economies risk exclusion as ‘age of AI’ dawns,,"IT’S estimated artificial intelligence (AI) will add as much as US$15.7 trillion (RM68.82 trillion) to the global economy by 2030.
 If current trends continue, much of this new wealth will be owned and controlled by corporations and individuals based in China and the United States, as well as by the national governments that represent them. 
 But technological superiority by great powers undermines the positive potential of AI for the majority of the world’s population, particularly in developing economies.The United States and China account for more than 94% of funding for AI startups over the past five years, and half of the world’s hyperscale data centres. 
 The two countries possess roughly 90% of the market capitalisation of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms, controlling a large proportion of cross-border data flows.
 Along with their allies, the nations that own and control AI platforms and the data that powers them stand to dominate the global economy for decades to come. 
 Experts in the field are also mostly from developed economies. 
 They enjoy a disproportionate representation in the industry bodies that develop the standards and technical protocols that shape the international regulations for AI, often at the expense of the differing needs of developing economies.
 Over 160 sets of AI ethics and governance frameworks have so far been developed by policymakers, think tanks, and activists. 
 Still, there are no platforms to coordinate these initiatives, or measures to ensure national governments align AI regulations and norms across international boundaries.
 The growing divide has implications for developing economies marginalised by the emerging AI sector. 
 Establishing a global database to track and monitor emerging AI legislation and regulations will capture and compare approaches and debates, particularly from developing economies. 
 The the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s AI policy observatory, a platform for policy discussions on AI, is a promising start but it can be built upon. 
 A recently released report from a working group convened by the Paris peace forum says an open, international dialogue on equitable AI governance could help set up global regulations. 
 These would consider human rights and equal opportunities relevant to the needs of developing economies. 
 And address rapidly-increasing socioeconomic inequality, meeting the challenges of sustainable development while achieving robust economic growth, and dismantling the enduring structures of colonialism.
 This dialogue aspires toward a set of universal AI principles developed by a transparent, informed, and widely-recognised international process. They could serve as a reference point for policies and legislation across national contexts and eventually translate into enforceable standards. 
 For example, it would be sensible for governments in developing economies to ensure corporate accountability when they procure AI-based services. 
 Compulsory social impact assessment risk analysis for any AI services offered by foreign corporations is one solution.
 Such approaches, including mandatory source code disclosures, can motivate compliance with domestic laws and protect rights while discouraging market abuses. 
 When source code is accessible to the public – and particularly to vigilant developers – platform owners are less likely to support designs that permit or profit from illegal activities. 
 Governments of developing economies can remedy the widening imbalance between data providers and data collectors by creating incentives for foreign tech companies to invest in domestic research and development facilities to amplify local AI capabilities.
 It is also important to deter “brain drain”, where top experts leave their homes to pursue international opportunities, by promoting incentives such as funds for innovation and research and development to retain and further develop domestic talent. 
 In an emerging AI economy, an exodus may prove particularly detrimental in exacerbating the financial imbalance between developed and developing economies.
 The benefits of AI are plenty, but mitigating the potential harm is crucial. 
 An international dialogue, focused on results, can create an equitable distribution of AI technologies. — The Jakarta Post/ANN

415906,StarBiz,3,04/05/2022,Startups apply artificial intelligence to supply chain disruptions,,"LONDON: Over the last two years a series of unexpected events has scrambled global supply chains. Coronavirus, war in Ukraine, Brexit and a container ship wedged in the Suez Canal have combined to delay deliveries of everything from bicycles to pet food.
 In response, a growing group of startups and established logistics firms has created a multi-billion-dollar industry applying the latest technology to help businesses minimise the disruption.
 Interos Inc, Fero Labs, KlearNow Corp and others are using artificial intelligence (AI) and other cutting-edge tools so manufacturers and their customers can react more swiftly to supplier snarl-ups, monitor raw material availability and get through the bureaucratic thicket of cross-border trade.
 The market for new technology services focused on supply chains could be worth more than US$20bil (RM87bil) a year in the next five years, analysts told Reuters.
 By 2025, more than 80% of new supply chain applications will use AI and data science in some way, according to tech research firm Gartner.
 “The world’s gotten too complex to try to manage some of these things on spreadsheets,” said Dwight Klappich, a Gartner analyst.
 Interos,  in its latest funding round, is one of the most successful in the nascent market. 
 The Arlington, Virginia-based company says it has mapped out 400 million businesses globally and uses machine learning to monitor them on behalf of corporate customers, alerting them immediately when fire, flood, hacking or any other event causes a potential disruption.
 Before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine in February, the company had assessed the impact of an invasion. Interos said it identified about 500 US firms with direct supplier relations with companies in Ukraine.
 Further down the chain Interos found 20,000 US firms had links to second-tier suppliers in Ukraine and 100,000 US firms had links to third-tier suppliers.
 Chief executive Jennifer Bisceglie said after the war started, 700 companies approached Interos for help in assessing their exposure to suppliers in Ukraine and Russia.
 She said the company was developing a new product to game out other hypothetical supply chain disruption scenarios, such as China invading Taiwan, for customers to understand their exposure to risk and where to find alternative suppliers.
 Supply chain shocks are inevitable, Bisceglie told Reuters. “But I think we’re going to get better at minimising these disruptions.”
 US airline Delta Air Lines Inc, which spends more than US$7bil (RM30.47bil) a year on catering, uniforms and other goods on top of its plane and fuel budget, is one company using Interos to keep track of its 600 primary suppliers and 8,000 total suppliers.
 “We’re not expecting to avoid the next crisis,” said Heather Ostis, Delta’s supply chain chief.
 “But we’re expecting to be a lot more efficient and effective than our competitors in how we assess risk when that happens.”
 Santa Clara, California-based KlearNow sells a platform that automates cumbersome paper-dominated customs clearance processes.
 That has been a lifesaver for EED Foods, based in Doncaster, England, which imports Czech and Slovak sweets and smoked meats for expat customers in Britain.
 “Before Brexit we were very scared we would have to shut down,” said Elena Ostrerova, EED’s purchasing manager. “But instead we are busy as never before.”
 Ostrerova said her company was still growing at an annual rate of 40% after Brexit took effect in early 2020, partly because some competitors gave up rather than tackling the onerous new paperwork for importing from the European Union. — Reuters",london ver series event global supply chain war ukraine brexit container ship suez canal delay delivery pet food response startup logistics firm multi dollar industry technology business disruption interos fero lab corp artificial intelligence edge tool manufacturer customer supplier snarl monitor raw material availability bureaucratic thicket cross border trade market technology service supply chain worth bil analyst reuters supply chain application data science tech firm gartner complex manage spreadsheet klappich gartner analyst interos funding round successful nascent market arlington virginia company business machine monitor behalf corporate customer fire flood event potential disruption russian tank ukraine february company impact invasion interos identified firm supplier relation company chain interos firm tier supplier ukraine firm tier supplier chief executive jennifer bisceglie war company exposure supplier ukraine russia company product game hypothetical supply chain disruption scenario taiwan customer exposure risk alternative supplier chain shock inevitable bisceglie reuters disruption airline delta air line bil bil catering uniform top plane fuel budget company primary supplier total supplier avoid crisis ostis delta supply chain chief lot efficient effective competitor risk santa clara california klearnow platform cumbersome paper custom clearance food england import slovak sweet meat customer brexit shut elena ostrerova manager busy ostrerova company annual rate brexit competitor onerous paperwork european union reuters,"[(2, 0.8488984), (5, 0.14741085)]",2

 They served as great examples of how properly imagined AI has the power to improve lives in many different ways, she said in a press release. 
 As part of its Digital Readiness initiative, Intel in collaboration with CREST also recently launched its AI for Youth programme in Malaysia. 
 The programme aims to help the youth develop a deep understanding of AI by demystifying the technology, and equipping them with the skillset and mindset required for AI readiness. 
 The programme is also intended to democratise access to AI toolsets and at the same time, train the youth to use them skillfully to create AI solutions that drive meaningful social impact.

408400,Lifestyle,4,11/04/2022,AI beats bridge champions,,"Several world champion bridge players had to accept defeat at the hands of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. A feat never previously achieved.
 The victories mark an important step in the develop- ment of AI, because of the use of “white box” AI, which acquires skills in a more human way, necessary to win at bridge compared to other strategy games such as chess.
 Until now, to demonstrate the potential of AI, humans were pitted against machines. 
 The AI trained itself by playing billions of games, in a process known as “deep learning”, and faced a human adversary, the champion in the category – a technique that works perfectly for winning against top chess, checkers or go players. 
 But not bridge, because this is a card game that requires more communication skills.
 “NooK”, a next-generation  AI, was trained for this very purpose. 
 It managed to beat eight world champion bridge players during a tournament taking place at the end of March in Paris, organised by French company NukkAI, NooK’s trainer.
 One reason why bridge is so challenging is that it incorporates features that are not yet well understood by various forms of AI. This card game demands that players work with incomplete information, and they must react to the behaviour of other players at the table.
 These kinds of skills are difficult for a machine to achieve. That is, until NooK. 
 At the Nukkai Challenge bridge tournament in Paris, the machine won 67 of the 80 rounds played, for a win rate of 83%.
 But how can this feat be explained? How did NooK manage to acquire skills that are more human-like than technological? It all comes down to the concept of explainable AI.
 One of the main pitfalls of “black box” AI, used for chess, for example, is that its decisions are enigmatic to humans or difficult for them to understand.
 “Previous AI successes, like when playing humans against chess, are based on black box systems where humans can’t understand how decisions are made. 
 “By contrast, the white box uses logic and probabilities just like a human,” explains Stephen Muggleton, professor in the department of computing at Imperial College London.
 NooK represents a white box or “neuro symbolic” approach. Rather than learning by playing billions of rounds of a game (with traditional deep learning), the AI first learns the rules of the game, then improves its game through practice. 
 It is a hybrid system based on rules and deep learning.
 “White box machine learning is closely related to the way we humans learn incrementally as we carry out everyday tasks,” says Muggleton.
 Even if a person or AI cannot explain in words what it is doing, its behaviour must be “readable” to others – it must apply rules that they understand. 
 This white box approach will be critical in fields such as healthcare and engineering. Autonomous cars negotiating a junction, for instance, will need to be able to read the behaviour of others, and react accordingly.
 For the moment, there is still a lot to be learned by AI, which does not understand, for example, the principle of bidding, part of the bridge game and an essential element for deepening communication, nor does it understand lying. – AFP Relaxnews",champion bridge player defeat hand artificial intelligence system feat victory step ment white box skill human bridge strategy game chess demonstrate potential human machine billion game process deep learning human adversary champion category technique top chess checker player card game communication skill nook generation beat champion bridge player march paris french company nook trainer reason bridge incorporates feature form card game player incomplete behaviour player table kind skill difficult machine nook nukkai challenge bridge tournament paris machine played win rate feat nook manage skill human technological concept explainable main pitfall black box chess decision enigmatic human difficult previous success human black box system human decision white box logic probability stephen muggleton professor department imperial college london nook white box neuro symbolic approach billion round game traditional deep learning rule game game practice hybrid system rule white box machine human everyday task person behaviour readable apply rule white box approach critical field engineering autonomous car junction instance behaviour react moment lot understand principle bidding bridge game essential element communication afp relaxnews,"[(4, 0.9945674)]",4
402618,Lifestyle,14,24/03/2022,Award-winning AI supercomputer,,"NVIDIA announced recently that the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is one of the first in the country to deploy the Nvidia DGX A100 system to provide the high-performance computing (HPC) performance needed for artificial intelligence (AI) research, teaching and learning.
 In UNM, the DGX system expects to see higher throughput and increased efficiency for its research community of undergraduate  and post-graduate students, and academics.
 UNM is one of two campuses of the University of Nottingham in the UK that bears the rich, research-led heritage – it is heavily engaged in research to address global challenges in a number of areas – all of which require powerful computing resources. These efforts include AI and advanced data analysis, and more specifically, computer vision, machine learning and neural  computation.
 The research groups UNM supports also focus on areas such as developing sustainable societies, inclusion in the workplace, nanotechnology, and smart manufacturing. 
 Asia Research Institute Malaysia, Centre for Green Technologies, Future Food Malaysia, and Institute for Aerospace Technology are among its other users.
 UNM’s research projects rely on modern AI techniques, particularly deep learning, and often adopt  simulation-based approaches in a large variety of application areas.
 To address the heavy computational demands of such activities, UNM is turning to Nvidia DGX A100, a universal system for all AI workloads with five petaflops of AI performance for unprecedented compute density, performance and flexibility. 
 Using the system’s Nvidia Multi-Instance GPU (graphic processing unit) technology, UNM will be able to flexibly allocate computing capabilities across every AI workload, supporting individual researchers to large teams.
 Unique levels of flexibility for use cases
 “The Nvidia DGX A100 is particularly attractive because it combines a large number of powerful GPUs that can be reconfigured  and combined in multiple ways depending on user requirements,” said UNM Faculty of Science and Engineering associate professor Tomas Maul.
 “It offers unique levels of flexibility that can cater to our wide spectrum of use cases, from researchers with heavy individual workloads, to large classes of undergraduate students, each with smaller workloads.”
 The DGX A100 system will help UNM centralise its HPC/GPU solutions and offer more computing flexibility to its academics and  students to further accelerate research outputs.
 Furthering AI capabilities
 Data science is now a core component of commercial industries and demand for skilled data  scientists is outstripping supply.
 Industries are leaning more and more on universities to provide better skilled graduates.
 Nvidia DGX A100 will be used to help further the AI capabilities of the university’s research community through the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute, which provides hands-on self-learning tools to advance knowledge in areas such as AI, accelerated computing,  accelerated data science, graphics and simulation.
 “UNM provides a very conducive environment for our research, which spans areas such as scientific computation, fluid mechanics, AI and data analytics and which can inform new ideas in urban planning, the environment and remote sensing. 
 “We have had a lot of IT support, too, which is crucial given all the high-performance computers used to conduct our research. This provides a productive environment for us to work in,” said UNM vice-provost, research and knowledge exchange Professor Andy Chan.

394058,StarEdu,2,06/03/2022,"TAR UC invests in big data, AI and esports",,"WITH two newly launched facilities, students at Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (TAR UC) will be further empowered to gain a learning experience that goes beyond academic knowledge and skills. 
 Set to nurture future digital talents, the Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Big Data Analytics (BDA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Hero Esports Arena will also strengthen the institution’s digital capabilities. 
 The CoE – a tripartite collaboration between Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), the Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI) and industry – aims to catalyse research activities related to big data and AI.
 Equipped with 25 high-end workstations which are able to perform data processing and data analytics, and run AI algorithms, the CoE has organised various activities and events since its inception in 2020. 
 These included five research projects on the use of BDA or AI in crop disease detection, building inspection, commercial decision-making, portfolio risk analysis, guided learning, social media insight extraction and social distancing; two international conferences; and four workshops on data analytics.
 It has also obtained five research grants, as well as offered two micro-credential courses in AI and an introduction to data science. 
 To date, the CoE has provided close to 80 internship placements in the fields of BDA or AI and has trained more than 500 students from TAR UC and other PDTIs.
 In his welcoming speech at the launch held on Jan 12, TAR UC president Prof Dr Lee Sze Wei said the CoE is an addition to the institution’s effort to build a research network that interconnects all research facilities in its Kuala Lumpur main campus and its branch campuses nationwide to support all research activities.
 MDEC chief digital skills and jobs officer Dr Sumitra Devi Govinda Nair, who was present to officiate the launch, said the CoE is meant as a platform to bring institutions and industries together, and make it easier for industries to introduce more immersive and hands-on learning to students and the community.
 She also commended TAR UC for its strategic initiatives in further developing esports.
 “It’s really good to see the CoE, which we have been looking forward to materialising, and it is fantastic to see TAR UC taking a lead in the area of esports, as well,” she said. 
 As the only higher education institution in Malaysia to have an esports arena located on campus, TAR UC is in a unique position to organise esports tournaments and leagues, as well as extend invitations to other esports teams.
 Sumitra Devi said esports in today’s world have evolved from just playing games. “Now, there is a whole value chain of job opportunities surrounding the esports industry, from developers to shoutcasters. I am excited to see what comes out of the esports arena and how we can bring both the CoE and esports to even greater heights,” she said.
 Prof Lee said aside from focusing on research and academics, TAR UC’s Beyond Education philosophy aims to provide students with a learning experience that stretches beyond a traditional classroom setting. 
 “With the Hero Esports Arena, we are able to provide students with an avenue to nurture and enhance their skills and talents, and also provide them with real-life exposure in the field of esports,” he said.",facility student abdul rahman university college tar gain experience academic knowledge skill nurture future digital talent excellence coe data analytics artificial intelligence hero strengthen institution digital capability tripartite collaboration malaysia digital economy corporation premier digital tech institution pdti industry catalyse activity data workstation data data analytics algorithm coe organised activity event inception project crop disease detection inspection commercial decision portfolio risk analysis social medium insight extraction social international conference data analytics grant micro credential course introduction data science coe close internship placement field trained student pdtis speech launch jan tar president prof lee wei coe addition institution effort build network interconnects facility lumpur main campus branch campus nationwide support activity chief digital skill job officer sumitra devi govinda nair launch coe platform bring institution industry easier industry immersive hand student community tar strategic initiative esports fantastic tar lead esports education institution malaysia campus tar unique position organise tournament league invitation esports team devi esports game chain job opportunity esports industry shoutcasters esports coe esports height lee academic tar education philosophy aim student experience stretch traditional classroom hero esports provide student nurture enhance skill talent real life exposure field esports,"[(0, 0.37728596), (1, 0.61850077)]",1
392710,Lifestyle,8,04/03/2022,Can AI produce art?,,"IN recent years, artificial intelligence has managed to infiltrate the arts. So much so that some fear it could replace human artists by using some form of imagination. 
 The US authorities, however, do not seem to share this opinion, affirming that AI technology cannot hold copyright on the works of art that it creates.
 The concept of “creating machines” is nothing new. But the art market has recently become infatuated with works generated by artificial intelligence. One of them, entitled Portrait Of Edmond de Belamy, even sold for US$432,500 (RM1.8mil) at Christie’s in 2018. This painting was created by a machine imitating human intelligence, which the French collective Obvious had trained using more than 15,000 portraits painted between the Middle Ages and the 20th century. 
 But can we say that artificial intelligence is an artist in its own right? Not for the American authorities. The US Copyright Review Board recently ruled that a work of art must necessarily be the product of a human mind in order to be protected by copyright. This decision follows a request from Stephen L. Thaler, the president and CEO of Imagination Engines, Inc.
 The scientist began administrative proceedings in 2018 to have copyright for A Recent Entrance To Paradise attributed to an artificial intelligence he invented. According to official documents, Stephen L. Thaler claims that the work “was autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine,” without any human intervention.
 But the US Copyright Review Board has refused to assign the copyright of A Recent Entrance To Paradise to this artificial intelligence. The organisation argues that this would violate the basic principles of copyright law, which state that all creations must be the product of a human mind. 
 “Thaler must either provide evidence that the Work is the product of human authorship or convince the Office to depart from a century of copyright jurisprudence. He has done neither,” reads the official decision. 
 This case reopens the debate about the role of artificial intelligence in artistic creation. Deep learning allows machines to learn by themselves. The GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) rely on a massive amount of data to generate new creations – a technique leaves some scientists wondering if this could be the key to providing machines with the very “human” quality of imagination. Researchers at the University of Southern California like to think so.
 They have been working for several years on an algorithm capable of designing new objects with different attributes. The scientists used the concept of “disentanglement” to allow the machine to generate novel images from numerous visual samples. 
 The artificial intelligence uses the features it has observed in the various images analyzed to perform “controllable novel image synthesis,” and thus create new never-before-seen compositions. The researchers say that this process of extrapolation comes closest to what is known as imagination, although there’s still some way to go before the machine replaces the artist. – AFP",artificial intelligence infiltrate art human artist imagination authority share opinion technology hold copyright art concept machine art market generated artificial intelligence portrait edmond christie painting machine human intelligence french collective obvious portrait middle age century artificial intelligence artist american authority board ruled product human mind copyright decision request stephen thaler president ceo imagination engine administrative proceeding entrance paradise artificial intelligence official document thaler claim computer algorithm machine human intervention copyright board copyright entrance paradise artificial intelligence organisation basic principle law creation product human mind thaler evidence product human authorship convince office depart century jurisprudence read official decision debate role artificial intelligence artistic creation deep learning machine gans generative adversarial network massive amount data generate creation scientist key machine human quality imagination researcher university southern california algorithm capable object scientist disentanglement machine generate image numerous visual sample artificial intelligence feature image perform controllable image synthesis create composition researcher process extrapolation closest imagination machine replaces afp,"[(3, 0.99415886)]",3
387728,Lifestyle,3,21/02/2022,Fighting inequality with AI,,"Determined to use her skills to fight inequality, South African computer scientist Raesetje Sefala set to work to build ­algorithms flagging poverty ­hotspots – developing datasets she hopes will help target aid, new housing or clinics.From crop analysis to medical diagnostics, artificial intelligence (AI) is already used in essential tasks worldwide, but Sefala and a growing number of fellow African developers are pioneering it to tackle their continent’s particular challenges.
 Local knowledge is vital for designing AI-driven solutions that work, Sefala said.
 “If you don’t have people with diverse experiences doing the research, it’s easy to interpret the data in ways that will marginalise others,” the 26-year old said from her home in Johannesburg.
 Africa is the world’s youngest and fastest-growing continent, and tech experts say young, ­home-grown AI developers have a vital role to play in designing applications to address local ­problems.
 “For Africa to get out of poverty, it will take innovation and this can be revolutionary, because it’s Africans doing things for Africa on their own,” said Cina Lawson, Togo’s minister of digital economy and transformation.
 “We need to use cutting-edge solutions to our problems, because you don’t solve problems in 2022 using methods of 20 years ago,” Lawson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video interview from the West African country.Digital rights groups warn about AI’s use in surveillance and the risk of discrimination, but Sefala said it can also be used to “serve the people behind the data points”.
 She mapped out every suburb and township in South Africa and then combined this dataset with satellite data and machine ­learning algorithms to capture the growth of these neighbourhoods over time.
 She soon realised the ­algorithms she had built only went so far because some townships – including where she grew up – were not being correctly predicted.Being able to refine the ­algorithms based on her lived ­experience meant the data ­collected became more accurate.“Those kinds of decisions ­determine who you alienate or include when you build your AI models,” said Sefala, the first AI research fellow at the Distributed AI Research (DAIR) institute – a community-driven research group.‘Delivering help’
 As Covid-19 spread around the world in early 2020, government officials in Togo realised urgent action was needed to support informal workers who account for about 80% of the country’s workforce, Lawson said.
 “If you decide that everybody stays home, it means that this ­particular person isn’t going to eat that day, it’s as simple as that,” she said.
 In 10 days, the government built a mobile payment platform – called Novissi – to distribute cash to the vulnerable.
 The government paired up with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) think tank and the University of California, Berkeley, to build a poverty map of Togo using satellite imagery.Using algorithms with the ­support of GiveDirectly, a non- profit that uses AI to distribute cash transfers, the recipients ­earning less than US$1.25 (RM5.23) per day and living in the poorest districts were identified for a direct cash transfer.“We texted them saying if you need financial help, please ­register,” Lawson said, adding that beneficiaries’ consent and data privacy had been prioritised.
 The entire programme reached 920,000 beneficiaries in need.
 “Machine learning has the advantage of reaching so many people in a very short time and delivering help when people need it most,” said Caroline Teti, a Kenya-based GiveDirectly director.‘Zero representation’
 Aiming to boost discussion about AI in Africa, computer ­scientists Benjamin Rosman and Ulrich Paquet co-founded the Deep Learning Indaba – a week-long gathering that started in South Africa – together with other colleagues in 2017.“You used to get to the top AI conferences and there was zero representation from Africa, both in terms of papers and people, so we’re all about finding cost ­effective ways to build a ­community,” Paquet said in a video call.In 2019, 27 smaller Indabas – called IndabaX – were rolled out across the continent, with some events hosting as many as 300 participants.
 One of these offshoots was IndabaX Uganda, where founder Bruno Ssekiwere said participants shared information on using AI for social issues such as ­improving agriculture and ­treating malaria.
 Another outcome from the South African Indaba was Masakhane – an organisation that uses open-source, machine ­learning to translate African ­languages not typically found in online programmes such as Google Translate.
 On their site, the founders speak about the South African philosophy of “Ubuntu” – a term generally meaning “humanity” – as part of their organisation’s ­values.
 “This philosophy calls for ­collaboration and participation and community,” reads their site, a philosophy that Ssekiwere, Paquet and Rosman said has now become the driving value for AI research in Africa.
 Inclusion
 Now that Sefala has built a dataset of South Africa’s suburbs and townships, she plans to ­collaborate with domain experts and communities to refine it, deepen inequality research and improve the algorithms.
 “Making datasets easily ­available opens the door for new mechanisms and techniques for policy-making around ­desegre- gation, housing, and access to ­economic opportunity,” she said.African AI leaders say building more complete datasets will also help tackle biases baked into ­algorithms.
 “Imagine rolling out Novissi in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Ivory Coast... then the algorithm will be trained with understanding ­poverty in West Africa,” Lawson said.
 “If there are ever ways to fight bias in tech, it’s by increasing diverse datasets... we need to ­contribute more,” she said.
 But contributing more will require increased funding for African projects and wider access to computer science education and technology in general, Sefala said.
 Despite such obstacles, Lawson said “technology will be Africa’s saviour”.
 “Let’s use what is cutting edge and apply it straight away or as a continent we will never get out of poverty,” she said. “It’s really as simple as that.” – Thomson Reuters Foundation",skill fight inequality south african computer scientist raesetje sefala build algorithm poverty hotspot datasets target aid housing clinic crop analysis medical diagnostics artificial intelligence essential task sefala fellow african developer tackle continent local knowledge vital designing driven solution people diverse experience easy interpret data marginalise johannesburg africa fastest continent tech expert developer vital role play application local africa poverty innovation revolutionary african cina lawson togo minister digital economy transformation edge solution method thomson reuters video interview west african country digital right surveillance risk discrimination serve people data suburb township south africa satellite data machine algorithm capture growth neighbourhood time township refine algorithm experience meant data accurate kind decision alienate build model fellow dair institute community covid spread government official realised urgent action support informal worker country workforce lawson person eat day simple day government mobile payment platform distribute cash vulnerable government innovation poverty action ipa tank university california berkeley poverty map togo satellite imagery algorithm support profit distribute cash transfer recipient day poorest district direct cash transfer financial register lawson beneficiary consent data privacy entire programme beneficiary machine advantage people short time people teti kenya director representation boost discussion computer scientist rosman ulrich paquet deep learning indaba week gathering africa colleague top conference representation africa term paper people cost effective build community video call indaba indabax continent event participant offshoot indabax uganda founder bruno ssekiwere participant social issue agriculture malaria south african indaba masakhane organisation source machine translate african language programme translate site founder south african philosophy ubuntu term humanity organisation value collaboration participation community site philosophy paquet rosman africa inclusion sefala south africa suburb township plan domain expert community deepen inequality algorithm datasets mechanism technique policy desegre gation housing access economic opportunity african leader complete datasets bias algorithm imagine novissi benin burkina faso ghana ivory coast algorithm understanding poverty west lawson fight bias diverse datasets require funding african project access computer science education technology sefala obstacle technology saviour edge straight continent poverty simple thomson reuters,"[(0, 0.9972836)]",0

377524,Main,13,25/01/2022,AI game changer for palm oil industry,,"TECHNOLOGY drives much of the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one that is now making waves. Together with other technologies including the Internet of things (IoT) and robotics, AI is changing the game of business and industry. 
 AI refers to a technology that can match human intelligence, making machines perform tasks almost like humans. Software algorithms are behind this technology. AI has become attractive because it can help deliver business growth, aid in complex decision-making, and transform businesses to become more intelligent.
 Coined by John McCarthy in the 1950s, AI essentially refers to the ability of a computer program to learn and think. Many problem solvers of the world now look to AI for answers. The global waste issue, which has grown increasingly complex, deploys AI to better organise collection and treatment at waste processing facilities. 
 The monitoring of pollution, especially of rivers and waterways, uses remote sensing technology to capture images that are then deciphered using AI. The same satellite imaging technology is used to monitor forests and look for cases of illegal logging. 
 Manufacturing deploys AI extensively to increase productivity as well as improve product quality.
 Data analytics also deploys AI extensively. This involves analysing vast amounts of data to better understand market trends and consumer choices. Social media is a major source of such data. 
 Agriculture is also increasingly looking to AI to resolve many of its challenges. The palm oil industry, for one, has been eyeing AI for some time now to resolve some of its productivity and marketing issues. 
 The industry remains preoccupied with the battle to neutralise the spread of fake news and untruths about palm oil. It is good to hear that the Plantation Industries and Commodities Ministry is going on an offensive to deal with this challenge. 
 However, productivity has emerged as a more daunting challenge in recent times. Here, we are talking about crop losses that have deprived the industry of much revenue. At the current high price of palm oil (touching RM5,000 per tonne), unharvested fruits have resulted in billions of ringgit in losses. Labour shortage is largely the reason behind why large tracts of oil palm fruits are not being harvested. 
 But it is not just labour that is contributing to the losses. It is also about harvesting when the fruits are optimally ripe. The loose fruits technique, which is widely used to decide harvesting time, is not fully reliable. One can see evidence of a high percentage of unripe fruits at the mills. Unripe fruits result in low oil content. 
 AI can definitely play a role here, but the industry needs the right strategy to effectively embrace it. 
 Through MPOB (Malaysian Palm Oil Board), the industry should invest in a centre dedicated to the development of AI in the entire spectrum of palm oil production. With AI, the industry can better monitor the sustainability of its performance, including the impact on greenhouse gas emission and capture. 
 In fact, with the adoption of AI and other related technologies, more young people may be attracted to work in the industry.

376974,Metro North,5,24/01/2022,AI company’s employability efforts recognised,,"ARTIFICIAL intelligence (AI)  company Skymind Holdings Bhd gained recognition from Higher Education Ministry for its efforts towards improving employability among graduates in its GetHired@KPT Programme at Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI). 
 Among those in attendance were Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Dr Noraini Ahmad. 
 The GetHired@KPT Programme under Higher Education Ministry (KPT) was part of the 100-day Malaysian Family Aspiration  programme towards decreasing unemployment in the country. 
 To date, the unemployment rate is at 4.3%. 
 Skymind was one of top six  companies out of 20 to receive the honour, especially for its innovative approach to talent development. 
 By leveraging on artificial  intelligence, Skymind has ensured its graduates are given a future-proof career pathway, specifically in high-tech innovative AI companies and projects. 
 Over 452 graduates have already benefitted from the GetHired @KPT Programme and Skymind has hired 18 as certified AI engineers. 
 The young aspirants have been involved in various projects such as an intelligent digital health  platform, AI-based visual  inspection for defect detection, and end-to-end AI development platform. 
 Most of this success stems from Skymind Education Group (SEG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Skymind Holdings. 
 SEG aims to upskill the talent in the country by narrowing any existing skill and knowledge gaps to prepare them for highly specialised AI jobs in the marketplace.
 It also aims to reskill working professionals to ensure that they are capable of meeting employers’ demands in their respective fields, and to strengthen the credentials  of young graduates and working  professionals so that their skill sets are continuously up to date. 
 As an AI ecosystem builder, Skymind has kicked off several  key initiatives to prepare more AI-ready graduates in Malaysia. 
 These include extensive collaborations with learning institutions to customise its AI curriculum and working with industry partners to conduct professional certification and employability programmes that ultimately work towards building a big pool of AI talents. 
 “The programmes are for those aspiring to join the AI workforce, or for current AI professionals  who are looking to reskill or upskill themselves,” said Skymind’s head of tertiary and education in talent development, Nur Balkis Amairuddin. 
 “We aim to prepare AI-ready  talents that are able to support the industry demands of IR4.0 and strengthen Malaysia’s AI ecosystem and ensure competitive advantages in creating lasting economic impact,” said Nur Balkis, adding that there was a really steep  learning curve at Skymind and trainees learn through exposure  to various projects and being  mentored by experts. 
 Since its inception in 2020, SEG has gone on to solidify its base across the region. 
 Over 400,000 participants have benefitted via various engagements on-ground and in the digital space, by outreach and workshops. 
 Of those participants, more than 200 have been hired by Skymind. 
 “We are determined to build an ecosystem, capable of building a viable talent pool and pipeline from Malaysia to feed the AI world’s hunger for talent. 
 “Therefore setting up the AI Learning campus will be a key part of the company’s expansion in this region, which is expected to be announced next year,” Nur Balkis added. 
 Universities such as Universiti Malaya (UM), Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) are some of the institutions collaborating with SEG. 
 The collaborations have  already impacted more than 3,000 students. 
 The focus on talent development has been a priority of SEG. 
 With over RM12mil invested in talent development initiatives for the past two years, SEG aims to cover more ground and expand the talent pool in this country. 
 Initiatives like the AI Apprentice programme and AI Graduate employability training programme have launched many graduates into the AI industry. 
 The AI reskilling and upskilling career advancement programme has enhanced the skills of working professionals while the AI Curriculum integration sets the standard for AI education in Malaysia. 
 Skymind has several projects that will create high-value jobs to ensure Malaysians reap the long-term benefits of the investments,  in tandem with enhancing the overall industry’s ecosystem to drive sustainable economic growth towards post-Covid-19 recovery.",artificial intelligence company skymind holding bhd recognition education ministry effort employability graduate programme universiti pendidikan sultan idris upsi attendance prime minister datuk seri ismail sabri education minister datuk seri noraini ahmad programme education ministry day malaysian family aspiration programme unemployment country unemployment rate top company honour innovative approach talent development artificial intelligence skymind graduate future proof career pathway tech innovative company project graduate gethired programme skymind certified engineer aspirant involved project intelligent digital health platform visual inspection defect detection development platform success skymind education subsidiary skymind holding aim upskill talent country skill knowledge gap job marketplace aim professional capable meeting employer demand respective field credential graduate professional ecosystem builder skymind key initiative ready graduate extensive collaboration institution curriculum industry partner professional certification employability building pool talent join workforce current professional upskill head tertiary education talent development balkis amairuddin aim prepare ready talent support industry strengthen malaysia ecosystem competitive advantage lasting economic impact nur balkis steep curve skymind trainee exposure project expert inception solidify base region participant engagement ground digital space outreach participant skymind determined build ecosystem capable building viable talent pool pipeline malaysia feed hunger talent campus key company expansion region nur balkis university malaya universiti sains usm universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm universiti teknologi malaysia utm institution seg collaboration student talent development priority mil talent development initiative aim ground talent pool country apprentice programme graduate employability training programme industry upskilling career advancement programme skill professional curriculum integration set education malaysia project job malaysian reap term benefit investment tandem industry ecosystem drive sustainable economic growth post covid recovery,"[(3, 0.99639195)]",3
