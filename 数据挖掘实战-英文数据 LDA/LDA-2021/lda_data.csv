368478,StarBiz,11,31/12/2021,AI-powered stock fund bails out of mega-cap FANG+ stocks,,"NEW YORK: An artificial intelligence (AI)-guided fund that has been lagging the market has jettisoned its mega-cap tech names in a bid to right the ship.
 The AI Powered Equity (AIEQ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) sold down its so-called FANG+ positions this month, leaving just Apple Inc in its top 20 holdings, according to the latest filings.
 On Dec 1, Microsoft Corp was the ETF’s number one position with Google parent Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc in third and fourth place, respectively.
 The fund has lagged its benchmark, the S&P 500 Total Return Index, by 9 percentage points this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
 “AIEQ continues to lighten up on its Big Tech exposure, with none in its top 10 positions,” said Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research. 
 “The only overlapping theme in its top 10 positions is cybersecurity, with the rest spanning everything from cloud computing and commercial real estate to medical devices and the semiconductor industry.”
 The shift in positioning suggests the AI fund’s “manager” – a quantitative model which runs 24/7 on IBM Corp’s Watson platform – is not buying into the narrative that America’s tech giants can lead the market higher next year. 
 The NYSE FANG+ Index – a gauge of tech mega-caps – has fallen some 7% from its all-time high in November, even as the S&P 500 climbs to fresh records. — Bloomberg",york artificial intelligence fund market mega cap tech name ship equity aieq exchange fund etf fang position month apple top holding filing microsoft corp etf position google parent alphabet fourth fund benchmark total return percentage data bloomberg aieq lighten tech exposure top position rabe founder datatrek theme top position cybersecurity cloud commercial real estate medical device semiconductor industry shift suggests fund manager quantitative model ibm corp watson platform narrative america tech giant market nyse fang gauge tech mega cap time november climb fresh record bloomberg,"[(9, 0.8200012), (10, 0.16936797)]",9
365790,StarBiz,8,24/12/2021,AI firm SenseTime prices Hong Kong IPO at bottom of range,,"HONG KONG: Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) firm SenseTime Group Inc is likely to price its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) at the bottom of its marketed range, according to people familiar with the matter.
 SenseTime plans to offer 1.5 billion shares at HK$3.85 (RM2.08) apiece, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public yet. 
 At that price, it would raise about HK$5.78bil (US$741mil or RM3.12bil). The company had marketed the shares at HK$3.85 (RM2.08) to HK$3.99 (RM2.15) each, with trading debut set for Dec 30.
 No final decision has been reached and details may still change, the people said. A representative for SenseTime didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours in Hong Kong.
 The AI startup reopened orders on Dec 20 for its first-time share sale after a move by the United States Treasury Department to sanction the company derailed the original schedule. 
 The “dynamic and evolving nature of the relevant US regulations” prompted it to exclude US investors from the offering, the company said in a revised filing this week. 
 The sanctions still won’t stop a US investor from buying or trading its class B shares, it said.
 Earlier this week, the company said it secured about US$512mil (RM2.15bil) from nine cornerstone investors.

361930,Main,20,14/12/2021,Seoul to test facial recognition AI on virus patients,,"SEOUL: South Korea will soon roll out a pilot project to use artificial intelligence, facial recognition and thousands of CCTV cameras to track the movement of people infected with the coronavirus, despite concerns about the invasion of privacy.
 The nationally funded project in Bucheon, one of the country’s most densely populated cities on the outskirts of Seoul, is due to become operational in January, a city official said.
 The system uses an AI algorithms and facial recognition technology to analyse footage gathered by more than 10,820 CCTV cameras and track an infected person’s movements, anyone they had close contact with, and whether they were wearing a mask, according to a 110-page business plan from the city submitted to the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communications Tech­nology), and provided by a parliamentary lawmaker critical of the project.
 The Bucheon official said the system should reduce the strain on overworked tracing teams in a city with a population of more than 800,000 people, and help use the teams more efficiently and accurately.
 While there has been wide public support for existing invasive track and trace methods, human rights advocates and some South Korean lawmakers have expressed concerns that the government will retain and harness such data far beyond the needs of the pandemic.
 Meanwhile, the Omicron coronavirus variant is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms according to early data, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday.
 The WHO said Omicron had spread to 63 countries as of Dec 9. Faster transmission was noted in South Africa, where Delta is less prevalent, and in Britain, where Delta is the dominant strain.
 Early evidence suggests Omicron causes “a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission”, the WHO said. — Agencies",seoul south korea roll pilot project artificial intelligence facial recognition thousand camera movement people coronavirus concern invasion privacy project bucheon country populated city seoul operational january city official system facial recognition technology analyse footage cctv camera person movement contact mask business plan city ministry science ict communication nology parliamentary lawmaker critical project bucheon official system strain team city population people wide public support invasive track trace method human right south korean lawmaker concern government harness data pandemic omicron coronavirus variant transmissible delta strain reduces efficacy severe symptom data health organisation sunday spread country faster transmission south africa delta prevalent britain delta dominant strain evidence reduction vaccine efficacy infection transmission agency,"[(1, 0.9915798)]",1
360822,StarBiz 7,2,11/12/2021,AI and healthcare plans at the heart of G3 Global,Bestinet founder takes over helm of company,"G3 GLOBAL Bhd is morphing into a provider of technology-based healthcare solutions, says its new major shareholder and executive director Datuk Seri Aminul Islam Abdul Nor (better known as Datuk Seri Mohd Amin). 
 “We want to focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and other information technology-based healthcare solutions. 
 “Especially with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare has taken centre stage. This new focus is a natural extension of our biomedical solutions,” Mohd Amin tells StarBizWeek via email replies to questions. Mohd Amin was appointed an executive director of G3 Global two weeks ago, after he emerged in the company with a 25% stake. 
 In corporate circles he is known as being the founder and chairman of technology firm Bestinet Sdn Bhd, which provides information technology solutions for managing foreign labour for all stakeholders.
 G3 Global had said that Mohd Amin had initiated the Foreign Workers Centralised Management System (FWCMS) for the Malaysian government, an end-to-end platform that connects all stakeholders in the migrant workers management such as employers, recruitment agents in Malaysia and resource countries, governments and medical centres.
 On Sept 8, G3 Global acquired a 51% stake in Bestinet Healthcare Sdn Bhd, which distributes hospital and pharmaceutical products that include rapid test kits for Covid-19, canulas, syringes and needles, among others.
 This week, G3 Global announced in a filing with the stock exchange that it intends to seek shareholder approval for a diversification of business into the healthcare sector related business, which includes the distribution of Covid-19 test kits and that this is being done via its acquisition of Bestinet Healthcare. 
 The filing revealed that Bestinet Healthcare has already secured revenue of RM2.6mil from the sale of antigen test kits since starting the business just four months ago. 
 It says that the plan is to source Covid-19 test kits from local manufacturers approved by the Medical Device Authority (MDA) and that Bestinet Healthcare has secured a distributor licence from MDA to undertake the distribution of such kits. 
 G3 Global said that the test kit market in Malaysia has grown from 1.1 million tests in 2020 to 21.5 million tests in 2021 and will hit 25 million tests in 2022. 
 Mohd Amin hints that G3 Global’s healthcare business will move beyond just the sale of test kits. 
 “The potential use for artificiall intelligence (AI) in healthcare is vast. One niche we are looking at is in the area of healthcare diagnosis,” says Mohd Amin.
 AI has been meant to be a theme for G3 Global for some time. Recall that back in 2019, G3 Global had inked a memorandum of understanding with SenseTime Group Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd to set up the first AI park in Malaysia. The three parties were to invest around US$1bil (RM4.22bil) in the project. However, there has been little development of the project since then. 
 Addressing the issue, Dirk Quinten, the managing director of G3 Global said the company had participated in the request for proposal for the development of the desired land area for the AI park and received a letter of intent in Oct 2020.
 “We have been working on the development of concepts, layouts, masterplans, foreign direct investment schemes, preferred technologies, partnerships and content among other things. 
 “This is a massive project that involves our inhouse team as well as local and international consultants, architects and developers. Term sheets with clients and partners are under discussion,” says Quinten.
 He adds that progress has been steady but projects of such scale require time to consider and consolidate the wishes, needs, variables of the many stakeholders involved. 
 “In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic is not creating a conducive environment for such a project, but things are still moving. Notably, the AI park is something that we think the country urgently needs and G3 Global is confident of ground-breaking in the near future,” he adds. 
 Quinten, who was made managing director in July last year explains that since assuming the position, the company has been undertaking various measures to put it on a better financial footing. 
 They include streamlining operations, reducing operating expenditure and improving the company’s cash position. 
 He notes that AI adoption rate in Malaysia is still very low. 
 However, large scale or high-end AI solutions require robust infrastructure, regulatory policies and other ingredients currently often unavailable nationwide, he points out. 
 On its part, he adds that G3 Global does not only provide high-end AI solutions but “also strives to be the partner to government agencies and policy makers in creating the blueprints for sustainable AI development in all verticals as detailed in the published national AI Roadmap”.
 Meanwhile, Mohd Amin hopes to bring more value to the company, leveraging on his expertise in mega IT developments and projects.
 “For example, we want to make the FWCMS modules available. 
 “G3 has many fantastic AI products and solutions which need to be embedded in IT infrastructure and ecosystem to maximise functionality and usability,” he says. 
 In explaining his past experience as a businessman, Mohd Amin says that he had built FWCMS to bring about transparency and efficiency in the management of human resources. 
 “After the number of years I have been in the business, I realised many challenges and issues in the human resource industry and the only way to resolve these issues was through technology to improve the business process and making them transparent for all stakeholders involved. 
 “This is where I came up with the FWCMS system, which was the first in the world bringing together all stakeholders into one single system to eliminate the leakages,” Mohd Amin says.  
 According to him, some of these challenges (in the human resources sector) include employers taking a long time for visa approvals, workers failing the medical tests, impersonation, forged medical reports and forged or no insurance coverage for the workers.  
 Eventually, Mohd Amin says that he plans to expand the business at G3 Global to South-East Asia and the Middle East.
 For the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2021, the company made a net loss of RM2.79mil as compared to a RM1.96mil net loss in the same period a year ago.

359118,Lifestyle,2,06/12/2021,AI vigilantes fuel censorship fears,,"A WOMAN posing in a thong outside a church; a single mother who berated Russian lawmakers and President Vladimir Putin; a saxophonist who criticised World War Two commemorations.
 They are among thousands of Russians who have faced court over their social media posts in the past year – a number digital rights groups say could soon turn into a deluge as authorities use artificial intelligence (AI) to police the Web.
 “We expect that all content posted on social media (in Russia) will be monitored by automated software,” said Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department for digital rights group Roskomsvoboda.
 “This will be particularly bad for young people who will have red flags put on (them), and be prosecuted and fined for posting different material,” he said by phone.
 Russia has passed an array of legislation in recent years to boost what it calls its Internet “sovereignty” and tighten control over cyberspace.
 The increasing scrutiny of what people say online is part of a wider drive that has seen Moscow pressuring foreign tech firms such as Twitter and Facebook to delete content it deems illegal and blocking opposition sites and news outlets.
 While the search for banned material used to be down to police or pro-government activists, authorities are turning to AI tools to quickly wade through millions of posts per day.
 Authorities say the monitoring systems are meant to tackle crime, but rights groups fear that they will be used to stifle dissent and crack down on free speech.
 “We are seeing a pincer attack by governments across the world with draconian laws that attack freedom of expression and privacy online,” said Likhita Banerji, a technology and human rights researcher at Amnesty International.
 State communications regulator Roskomnadzor did not reply to a request for comment.
 Constant monitoring
 Since 2017, the Perm-based tech firm Seuslab has been supplying law enforcement in dozens of regions with software that its director Evgeny Rabchevsky said can process a billion social networking pages and instant messaging chats a day.
 He said police use the tool to detect and prevent crimes including terrorism, child pornography, drug-related offences and “destructive subcultures” – a term he said referred to issues like “child suicide propaganda” and calls for violence.
 “Authorities use the product to assess social tensions, identify problematic issues of interest ... (and) adjust their activities,” he said, adding that the firm recently developed an AI tool to monitor social media activity during protests. 
 In October, the Center for the Study and Network Monitoring of the Youth Environment, an NGO founded on behalf of Putin, said it had developed an AI tool to scan social media for what it considered socially dangerous and destructive content.
 The tool was created under a scheme run by youth affairs agency Rosmolodyozh, which did not respond to requests for comment.
 Instead, the spokesperson pointed to an interview in Forbes Russia magazine in which the head of the NGO, Denis Zavarzin, said its system was “constantly monitoring” about 1.5 million accounts. 
 Research shows more Russian AI cyber-monitors are in the making.
 Official documents seen by Reuters in September show that authorities are developing a new monitoring system that will automatically search for banned content on social networks and the messaging app Telegram.
 And tenders are also planned for two more tools, one to search for visual information and the other to defend against information threats.All three systems are expected to be up and running next year, as draft budget proposals released in September showed Russia may spend 31bil roubles (RM1.76bil) on enhancing its Internet infrastructure in 2022 to 2024.
 Penalties aplenty 
 In Russia, there is no shortage of laws netizens can fall foul of.
 In 2019, the country imposed new fines of up to 100,000 roubles (RM5,700) on people who spread what the authorities regard as fake news or show “blatant disrespect” for the state.
 Court documents seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation show Seuslab’s tool was used that year to bring extremism charges against a woman for a blasphemous social media post.
 Activists and others have landed in hot water for posts related to what the government considers “extremist” organisations, including the Jehovah’s Witnesses religious group and groups linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
 Damir Gainutdinov, a lawyer who heads the Net Freedoms Project run by human rights group Agora, said last year journalists and bloggers received more than 1,000 fines for online speech violations.
 Gainutdinov believes the fines came from an automated system.
 “Even the text of the notice is always the same, it’s copied and pasted over and over,” he said.
 According to Agora, more than 22,000 administrative cases have been initiated since 2017, which include displaying prohibited symbols and disseminating extremist material, with cases nearing a record 7,000 in 2021 alone.
 Andrey Shabanov, a saxophonist from the city of Samara, is facing charges including rehabilitating Nazism and disrespecting Russia’s military for a series of posts criticising celebrations of the Soviet victory in World War Two.In May last year, he allegedly decried Soviet totalitarianism on VKontakte, a Russian social media site, and said an annual parade in which people march with portraits of relatives who fought in the war was “idiotic”.
 The 40-year-old musician also uploaded a photo of Adolf Hitler to a website dedicated to the parade, in a move his lawyer Aleksei Lapuzin said aimed to draw attention to what Shabanov saw as “the growth of fascism in Russia”.
 Lapuzin, whose client faces a maximum of three years in jail, said the case was emblematic of the shrinking space for online free speech in the country.
 Darbinyan of Roskomsvoboda said the deployment of AI vigilantes was all the more concerning with no adequate legal framework for digital rights in place and the government bent on “clearing Russian cyberspace of all undesirable content”.
 Earlier this year, Putin called for the Internet to be bound by moral rules to stop society fraying and railed against what he said was its role in drawing children into opposition street protests, prostitution and drugs.
 Shabanov, the saxophonist, said he refrained from posting on social media for a while after his case was initiated, but has now returned to his usual online habits, even though the case is still being heard.“I don’t think words should be something you should be prosecuted for,” he said via WhatsApp. 
 “Words or stupid actions are not a crime.”
 Others are more cautious.
 Some rights activists have urged Internet users to delete old posts – or stay off social media altogether.
 “We do not recommend our supporters use Russian social networks in general. We do not consider them safe,” said Mikhail Klimarev, director of the Internet Protection Society, a privacy group.
 “We are in a cyberwar, with many people in prison and others persecuted for their words on the Internet. Self-censorship is becoming more and more common practice.

358781,StarEdu,7,05/12/2021,AI: A new way to solve problems,,"IN 2016, AlphaGo, a Go-playing computer programme developed by Google DeepMind, beat 18-time Go world champion human player, Lee Sedol, in four out of five games. 
 The match put artificial intelligence (AI) advancement in the limelight and received attention beyond academia although this was not the first time a computer programme won in a man-against-machine competition. 
 In 1997, world chess champion Garry Kasparov was beaten by Deep Blue, a supercomputer developed by IBM. The competition was the first game ever recorded in which a computer software defeated an expert player under tournament regulations.
 Although both matches appear similar, the underlying AI techniques are two decades apart. 
 Deep Blue uses good, old-fashioned AI, which requires the programmer to present the problem in a way that the computer can compute. In other words, the AI programme is only as good as the chess knowledge programmed by the programmer.
 On the contrary, AlphaGo uses machine learning approach, specifically deep reinforcement learning, which is capable of learning the game from watching and playing the game against human and also itself, repetitively. 
 AlphaGo was then succeeded by AlphaGo Zero, which was capable of learning the game starting from zero by playing against itself without any human data.
 The emergence of these AI techniques means that AI is no longer bound by the limits of the human programmer. 
 AlphaGo Zero took only three days to learn the game from scratch and beat its predecessor, AlphaGo, in all 100 games.
 When AI can be trained to perform tasks better than humans, some begin to worry that mankind is facing existential risk against AI, possibly due to the influence of science fiction movies. 
 Such human-like level of AI is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) but many AI applications that we have today do not have any form of consciousness and are only designed to perform a single task.
 Many of these AI applications are already in our smartphones and living environment. 
 Some of the more commonly used AI applications are the unlock phone function which uses face recognition technology, and the voice command function which activates certain phone functions through verbal commands. On a larger scale, AI is used by organisations for surveillance, elevator group control, and building access control.
 Although some of these applications have been around for ages, the advancement of AI has made these applications more effective and efficient over the years. 
 For instance, the speech recognition of yesteryears that used AI would never be able to handle the speed and slang evident in speeches and conversations of today. 
 If you have your smartphone with you, you can try out the speech recognition function by saying “Ok Google” for Android phone and “Hey Siri” for iPhone without the need to follow the intonation of a native English speaker. That’s how smart the AI is today.
 The use of AI is no longer limited to prototypes in laboratory and non-mission-critical applications. 
 Over the years, due to the breakthrough in AI techniques and computing hardware, such as the deep learning algorithm and computers with built-in AI processors, AI performance has now reached a level where it is usable in critical applications such as transportation, healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.
 One notable example in transportation is the self-driving vehicle. A self-driving vehicle uses AI to perceive its surroundings, anticipate the speed and direction of incoming vehicles to avoid collision, and at the same time actuate the controls of the car to navigate safely to its destination. 
 In healthcare, Google DeepMind created AlphaFold, an AI programme that can predict the structure of proteins at an unprecedented accuracy and speed. This has helped scientists to better understand the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
 Similarly, in finance, AI is deployed to assess credit risks which does not only mitigate financial risk, but also performs credit risk assessment much faster. It is also believed that the latest AI technology can evaluate a loan application, which normally takes days to complete, in mere minutes.
 There are many other AI applications that users are unaware of. For instance, in telecommunications, AI is used to monitor cellular network resources and overcome problems before user experience is impacted.
 The use of AI has become indispensable in our daily lives. The list of AI applications will continue to grow and revolutionise the way problems are solved.ASSISTANT PROFESSOR

356917,Lifestyle,3,29/11/2021,AI surveillance takes US prisons by storm,,"WHEN the sheriff in Suffolk County, New York, United States, requested US$700,000 (RM2.9mil) from the US government for an artificial intelligence (AI) system to eavesdrop on prison phone conversations, his office called it a key tool in fighting gang-related and violent crime.
 But the county jail ended up listening to calls involving a much wider range of subjects – scanning as many as 600,000 minutes per month, according to public records from the county obtained by the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 Beginning in 2019, Suffolk County was an early pilot site for the Verus AI-scanning system sold by California-based Leo Technologies, which uses Amazon speech-to-text technology to transcribe phone calls flagged by keyword searches.
 The company and law enforcement officials say it is a crucial tool to keep prisons and jails safe, and fight crime, but critics say such systems trample the privacy rights of prisoners and other people, like family members, on the outside.
 “T​​he ability to surveil and listen at scale in this rapid way – it is incredibly scary and chilling,” said Julie Mao, deputy director at Just Futures Law, an immigration legal group.
 Suffolk County is among dozens of county jails and state prisons in seven US states, including major metro areas such as Houston, Texas, and Birmingham, Alabama, that Leo says have so far implemented the Verus system to monitor inmates’ calls.Undersheriff Kevin Catalina, who helped run the programme in Suffolk County, said the system “unquestionably benefits public safety, and the safety of staff and inmates”.
 Emails and contracts from eight US states show the tool is used to scan a wide range of calls, for example conversations involving mention of the Spanish word for lawyer or accusations that detention facilities were covering up Covid-19 outbreaks.
 In Suffolk County, emails from the sheriff’s office show officials sometimes searched for words with multiple or benign meanings such as “mara”, which can mean gang or simply a group of friends.
 Sheriff’s deputies in Suffolk County also circulated a regular intelligence brief of prisoners the system flagged for illegally collecting unemployment benefits while in the jail.
 A series of court rulings have given US authorities wide scope to use surveillance of prisoners’ conversations as long as they are working to ensure safety and fight crime.
 “All county inmates are notified that their phone calls are monitored,” Catalina said.
 Leo, which declined to comment, says on its website that Verus is an “objective” way to flag threats to incarcerated people, “disrupt criminal operations within correctional facilities and assist ongoing investigations with critical evidence”.
 Innocent people
 The company is one of several that are offering or working to provide surveillance services, including the two main firms that already provide the infrastructure for prison phone calls, Securus and GTL, both of which market monitoring services.
 “We are committed to protecting the civil liberties of all those who use our products,” a spokesperson for Securus said in a written statement.
 GTL declined to comment when asked whether it was still proceeding with the technology and what safeguards were in place.
 Leo advertises Verus as the most advanced system on the market.
 In documents obtained through a records request to the Missouri Department of Corrections, it is described as unique among competitors in offering near-real-time analysis and actionable reports.
 It is also hailed as a means to help law enforcement identify gang members by flagging “patterns of behaviour among inmates and their associates”.
 Instead of trawling through hours of recorded calls, Catalina said the system “allows staff to be more efficient with their time by honing in on keywords that meet specific objectives”.
 But using Verus to link people on prison phone calls to gang activity risks sweeping in innocent people, too, said Beryl Lipton, a researcher with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) who investigates prison surveillance systems.
 “There’s often no way to figure out if you’re on that kind of list, and how to get off it,” she said, adding that law enforcement in Suffolk County had a history of erroneously labelling Latino men as gang members.
 Suffolk County did not respond to a request for comment on Lipton’s criticism.
 ‘Stretch the limit’
 Intelligence gleaned from the Verus system is already shared with current and potential Leo clients around the United States, and more than two dozen law enforcement and immigration agencies and divisions, according to documents from Suffolk County.
 At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Leo – in partnership with prison authorities – expanded its focus to monitoring telephone conversations about the virus in detention facilities, documents show.
 A data table circulated by the company to clients showed it had flagged thousands of calls based on keywords including “cough” and “infection” between March and June in 2020, highlighting its role in containing outbreaks among prisoners.
 The technology was not just used to detect possible Covid-19 outbreaks, however.
 In Calhoun County, Alabama, prison authorities used Verus to identify phone calls in which prisoners vouched for the cleanliness of the facility, looking for potential ammunition to fight lawsuits, email records show.As part of an emailed sales pitch to the jail in Cook County, Illinois, Leo’s chief operating officer, James Sexton, highlighted the Alabama case as an example of the system’s potential uses.
 “(The) sheriff believes (the calls) will help him fend off pending liability via civil action from inmates and activists,” he wrote.
 A spokesman for Cook County said it had explored a pilot with Leo to help identify instances of “self-harm” in its facilities, but decided the technology was too expensive.
 Prisons are allowed to undertake surveillance related to “legitimate penological goals”, said Stephanie Krent, staff  attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Public records show Verus is routinely deployed, for example, to identify inmates who might be contemplating self-harm or suicide, or find murderers and rapists inside and outside of correctional facilities.
 But Krent said surveillance operations like the one carried out in Alabama “really stretched the limit”.
 During a similar operation in Suffolk County, the Verus system flagged a phone call in which an inmate tells his father the jail is covering up a Covid-19 outbreak, and discusses contacting the media.
 An official report about the phone call was shared with nearly a dozen prison staff members and Leo employees, documents from Suffolk show.
 Such incidents demonstrate how AI-powered surveillance tools can be used to identify prisoners who speak out against abuse or want to become whistleblowers, Krent said.
 “Protecting the interest and reputations of the people who run the jail is not a legitimate goal,” Krent said after reviewing the emails.
 ‘Avalanche effect’
 And despite the emphasis on gang activity and serious crime, emails from New York show authorities have begun using Verus to get leads on more minor offences – from using contraband cellphones to benefit fraud.
 Earlier this year, Texas awarded a contract to Leo to work with facilities dealing with a recent surge in migrants trying to cross the US-Mexico border, after the governor declared a state of emergency.
 “You can see how the justification changes over time,” said Daniel Schwarz, a technologist with the New York Civil Liberties Union who reviewed some of the documents.
 In Suffolk County alone, Verus was used to monitor more than 2.5 million phone calls between its implementation in April 2019 and May 2020 – leading to 96 “actionable intelligence reports”, according to county documents.
 “This technology has detected and prevented inmate suicides, uncovered human trafficking, and prevented and solved violent crimes,” Catalina said.
 But Krent said it was not clear whether the 96 reports justified sweeping up several million phone calls.“There’s an avalanche effect. Once a technology like this is implemented it’s hard to let it go,” she said.
 With prisons around the United States rolling out more advanced surveillance systems, Schwartz said limitations must be put in place.
 “We need to think about what happens to people when the only communication they have with their families and loved ones comes with a big surveillance target on their backs,” he said. – Thomson Reuters Foundation",sheriff suffolk county york united mil government artificial intelligence system prison phone conversation office key tool gang violent crime county jail call wider range subject minute month public record county thomson reuters suffolk county pilot site verus system california leo technology speech text technology phone call keyword search company law enforcement official crucial tool prison safe fight crime critic system trample privacy right prisoner people family ability scale rapid scary julie deputy director future law immigration legal suffolk county dozen jail prison major metro houston texas birmingham alabama leo verus system monitor undersheriff kevin catalina suffolk county system unquestionably benefit public safety safety staff email contract scan wide range conversation mention spanish word lawyer accusation detention facility covid outbreak county email sheriff office official multiple benign meaning mara gang sheriff deputy county regular intelligence prisoner system unemployment benefit jail series court ruling authority wide scope surveillance prisoner conversation safety fight crime county inmate phone call catalina leo comment verus objective flag threat people disrupt criminal operation correctional facility ongoing investigation critical evidence innocent people company provide surveillance service main firm infrastructure prison phone securus gtl market monitoring service civil liberty product spokesperson securus statement gtl comment technology safeguard advertises advanced system market document record missouri department correction unique competitor real time analysis actionable report law enforcement gang pattern behaviour inmate associate hour call catalina system staff efficient time keywords specific objective verus people phone call gang activity risk sweeping innocent people researcher electronic frontier foundation eff prison surveillance system figure list law enforcement suffolk county history latino gang county respond request comment lipton criticism stretch limit intelligence verus system current potential leo client united dozen law enforcement immigration agency division document county height pandemic leo partnership prison authority focus telephone conversation detention facility document data table company client thousand call keywords cough infection march june role outbreak prisoner technology covid outbreak county alabama prison authority phone prisoner cleanliness facility potential ammunition fight lawsuit record sale pitch jail cook county illinois chief officer james alabama system potential sheriff fend liability civil action inmate activist spokesman cook county pilot leo identify instance harm facility technology expensive prison undertake surveillance legitimate penological goal krent staff attorney knight amendment institute columbia university public record identify harm suicide murderer rapist correctional facility surveillance operation alabama stretched limit operation county verus system phone call inmate jail covid outbreak medium official report phone call dozen prison staff leo employee document suffolk incident surveillance tool prisoner whistleblower reputation people legitimate goal krent email emphasis gang activity crime york authority verus lead minor offence cellphone fraud texas contract leo facility surge migrant mexico border governor emergency justification time daniel schwarz technologist york civil liberty union document suffolk county verus monitor phone implementation actionable intelligence report county document technology prevented inmate suicide uncovered human trafficking solved violent crime krent report phone call technology hard prison advanced surveillance system schwartz limitation people communication family surveillance target thomson reuters,"[(9, 0.99805707)]",9
354731,Lifestyle,3,22/11/2021,Gulf nations bet big on AI,,"Robots puttering around Dubai’s hi-tech Expo site could be a sign of things to come for the Gulf, where new cities are being built from scratch with artificial intelligence (AI) at their core.
 The 5G-enabled Expo, covering an area twice the size of Monaco, will remain as a “city of the future” and tech industry hub, the Expo’s chief said before its grand opening last month.
 But the US$7bil (RM29.2bil) project, featuring robots that greet visitors and can be used to order food, is not alone in the wealthy Gulf, where petro-dollars are being invested heavily in a post-oil future.
 Neighbouring Saudi Arabia is lavishing US$500bil (RM2.08 trillion) on Neom, a brand new, next- generation Red Sea tech centre that will offer ultra-connectivity to its planned population of one million-plus, and is trialling airborne taxis.
 AI is also at the heart of other Saudi developments including the Red Sea Project, a new tourist area that will use smart systems to monitor environmental impacts and visitor movements.
 Analysts say the Gulf monarchies are willing to bet big on AI, knowing they must move away from their reliance on fossil fuel industries and become more active in tech, tourism and other areas.
 “You’ve got very forward (-looking), somewhat risk-loving leadership that sees the need to transform,” said Kaveh Vessali, a partner at consultancy firm PwC Middle East.
 “I think that’s just completely the opposite of what I see in the rest of the world.”
 Pedal to the metal
 AI courses in Bahrain primary schools, the UAE’s plans for automated delivery drones, and Dubai’s ambition to have 25% of all transport automated by 2030 offer further evidence of the Gulf’s tech aspirations.
 The Middle East is predicted to receive only 2% of the estimated US$15.7 trillion (RM65.5 trillion) global AI economy by 2030, according to PwC.But analysts say the Gulf countries – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE – are playing the long game, positioning themselves to leapfrog global players.
 The annual growth rate of the Middle East AI market is about 20% to 34%, led by the UAE and then Saudi Arabia, PwC said in a report, predicting that more than 10% of each of the two countries’ GDP will come from AI by 2030.
 “Governments have the luxury of being more strategic,” said Vessali, citing the 20 and 50-year plans which are a hallmark of Gulf governments.
 “This is unheard of a: in the private sector, and b: in the West,” he adds.
 Vessali said most AI companies in Gulf states are fully, or at least semi-governmental, with comparatively low pressure to generate short-term returns.
 However, the region has a history of investing in companies which did not become particularly profitable, outside a few core industries such as oil and gas, he warned.
 ‘Streamlined’ decision-makingWhile the region might be known as culturally conservative, its AI strategies are better characterised as liberal and aggressive, according to some local players.
 In 2017, the UAE appointed its first minister of state for AI, Omar bin Sultan al-Olama, to spearhead the country’s AI strategy, launched that same year.
 The UAE has said it aims to become one of the leading nations in AI by 2031, creating new economic and business opportunities, and generate up to 335 billion dirhams (RM381bil) in extra growth.
 “The region seems to classify being left behind on new technologies as a bigger risk than anything else,” said Cesar Lopez, the CEO of Datumcon.
 “Taking the risk to do what others aren’t has attracted and built business,” he said.
 The data and AI solutions company based in the UAE and Saudi Arabia is using computer vision to scan and identify damaged containers at Jebel Ali port in Dubai, one of the world’s busiest, operated by logistics company DP World.
 But despite the Gulf’s AI investments, the lack of reliable and accessible data sets, which are at the core of these systems, remain a barrier.
 “It’s going to take a few years to get there because the data isn’t mature enough for it yet (in the region),” said Stephen Rawson, an associate at American consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
 While Gulf countries have been better at centralising data across different governmental platforms, other leading countries have managed better data sets for longer.
 But being newer to data collection has its advantages, said Rawson, as Gulf countries can generate cleaner data to create more streamlined AI systems.
 “They are empowered to do this more than they would be in the West,” said Rawson, because with private enterprises, “getting them to work and play nice will only work if there’s a profit margin incentive for all of them.” – AFP",robot dubai tech expo site sign gulf city artificial intelligence core expo size monaco city future tech industry hub chief grand month bil project robot greet visitor food wealthy gulf petro dollar oil future saudi arabia bil neom brand generation sea tech centre ultra connectivity population airborne taxi heart saudi development red sea project tourist smart system environmental impact visitor movement analyst monarchy move reliance fossil fuel industry active tech tourism risk leadership transform kaveh vessali partner consultancy firm pwc east opposite rest pedal metal course primary school uae plan delivery drone ambition transport offer evidence gulf tech aspiration predicted receive global economy pwc analyst country kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia uae playing game leapfrog global player annual growth rate east market uae saudi arabia pwc report country government luxury strategic vessali plan hallmark gulf government unheard private sector west vessali company semi governmental low pressure generate short term return region history company profitable core industry oil gas streamlined decision makingwhile region conservative strategy liberal aggressive local player minister omar bin sultan spearhead country strategy aim nation economic business opportunity dirham bil extra growth region classify technology bigger risk cesar lopez ceo datumcon risk built business data solution company uae saudi arabia computer vision scan identify container ali port dubai busiest logistics company gulf investment reliable accessible data set system barrier data region stephen rawson associate american consulting firm wyman gulf country data governmental platform country data set data collection advantage gulf country cleaner data create system west rawson private enterprise nice profit margin incentive afp,"[(1, 0.99606335)]",1
351713,Lifestyle,4,15/11/2021,Accelerating AI adoption,Five ways artificial intelligence could shape our lives in the future.,"TECH evangelists habitually brim with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) potential to transform our lives, and the crowds at this year’s Web Summit international conference were no exception.
 Here are five uses for AI showcased at one of the world’s largest technology conferences, which returned to Lisbon, Portugal after the 2020 edition was called off due to the pandemic.
 1 Heart health
 When Iker Casillas learned of a startup that uses AI to better detect irregular heart rhythms, he swiftly signed up as an investor.
 The Spanish football legend had suffered a heart attack in 2019, putting a brutal end to his career.
 Madrid-based company Idoven analyses data from home heart monitoring kits to track people’s cardiac health – and crucially, to flag up looming problems.
 “We are the first company in the world capable of doing it,” its CEO Manuel Marina-Breysse said.
 AI is also being used by a growing number of mental health startups.
 Woebot, a chatbot which people can use to unburden their anxieties, adapts its responses based on an AI-informed reading of the person’s emotional state.
 “If somebody is in distress or they’re really not feeling great, Woebot will invite them to work on it, or just get it off their chest,” explained its founder Alison Darcy, a clinical research psychologist.
 Some may find the idea of pouring one’s heart out to a chatbot unnerving, but the Silicon Valley startup points to studies suggesting that people sometimes prefer confiding in a non-judgmental robot.2 Reducing waste
 AI doesn’t represent a straightforward win for the climate.
 Training a single algorithm system can use nearly five times the emissions produced by a car over its lifetime, according to University of Massachusetts researchers.
 But AI is also making a wide range of industrial processes more efficient, from cement production to cooling data centres.
 It could also be used to reduce the amount of garbage we send to landfills.
 British startup Greyparrot uses AI to recognise different types of waste moving down a conveyor belt, picking out recyclables from plastic to glass better than the machines typically used at the moment.
 3 Safer streets
 Could AI stop road accidents? Irish startup Provizio is developing technology that uses machine learning to analyse data from sensors attached to a car.
 In time, its founder Barry Lunn hopes that will allow emergency braking systems to kick into gear 10 times faster than previously.
 4 Code writing
 The age of AI shunning all need for human help, and writing its own computer code, is closer than you may think.
 One initiative generating a buzz in Lisbon was Copilot, a joint project by software development platform GitHub and research lab OpenAI.
 The tool can auto- complete chunks of code, understanding the intentions of the human software engineer.
 But New York University researchers suggest the computers still need us: around 40% of the time, the code still has bugs in it.
 5 Deepfakes for fun 
 Recent years have seen growing alarm over deepfake technology, in which stunningly realistic likenesses of living people can be made to act as the creator pleases.
 Deepfakes appearing to show actor Tom Cruise went viral this year, prompting fresh questions over whether the technology could be used for fraud or even political manipulation.
 Reface, a US startup founded by Ukrainians, wants to use deepfake AI for more playful purposes, allowing the user to swap Justin Bieber’s head, or the Mona Lisa’s, for their own.
 But co-founder Ivan Altsybieiev imagines a future where people could mock up entire remakes of their favourite TV shows, starring themselves.
 A “future where all content could be personalised”, he said. – AFP",tech brim enthusiasm artificial intelligence potential transform crowd web summit international conference exception largest technology conference lisbon portugal edition pandemic heart health iker casillas startup detect irregular heart investor spanish football legend heart attack brutal career madrid company idoven analysis data heart monitoring track people health company capable ceo manuel marina breysse mental health startup chatbot people unburden anxiety response informed person emotional distress woebot invite chest founder alison clinical psychologist idea heart chatbot silicon valley startup study people judgmental robot waste represent straightforward climate training single algorithm system time emission car lifetime university massachusetts researcher wide range industrial efficient cement production data centre amount garbage landfill british startup greyparrot recognise type conveyor recyclables plastic glass machine moment safer street road accident irish startup provizio technology machine analyse data sensor car time founder barry emergency system kick gear time code age human computer code initiative buzz lisbon copilot joint project software development platform github lab tool auto complete chunk understanding intention human software engineer york university researcher computer time code bug deepfakes alarm deepfake technology realistic likeness people plea deepfakes actor tom cruise viral fresh question technology fraud political manipulation reface startup ukrainian playful purpose user swap justin head mona lisa founder ivan altsybieiev future people entire remake favourite future content afp,"[(0, 0.99554116)]",0
351447,StarEdu,8,14/11/2021,AI: Chaos without control,Ensure development of human-programmed systems not abused,"WILL artificial intelligence (AI) take over my job? Will it take over the world? 
 Like most, if not all, upper secondary school students, I’m facing the dilemma of picking a university and a career I want to go into. 
 When I first began searching for possible careers, I looked up “careers that AI will not take over”. 
 With AI being such a new phenomenon, it is not surprising that we may feel threatened by its existence. But is AI really a threat?
 Known as a computerised system that is programmed to think like humans, AI is able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. 
 These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, problem-solving, decision-making, and translation between languages. 
 AI can analyse sales calls, input and analyse values much faster than any human could, thus it has already begun to replace the jobs of telemarketers, bookkeeping clerks and receptionists, for instance. 
 At the speed at which it is currently progressing, it is likely that AI will continue to take over jobs that can be automated.
 In order to understand the future of AI, we have to travel back a few centuries when machines were first popularised. 
 Back then, people feared the large, foreign machines would take away jobs, such as factory work, cloth making and automobile manufacturing. 
 Now, it’s hard to imagine manufacturing without machinery. 
 In addition, many factory goods are now cheaper for consumers without having to exploit human labour. 
 And when computers were first popularised 20 years ago, people too feared that these digital devices would take away jobs. 
 While they have indeed taken away or reduced some jobs, such as those of cashiers, bank tellers and phone operators, people with these jobs have learned to work alongside computers. 
 For example, some of these bank tellers now work in cybersecurity to minimise the risk of Internet banking scams. 
 The jobs that computers have created certainly outweigh the ones they have taken away. 
 Some social media influencers earn more than the average doctor, which has traditionally been considered the “highest-paying” job. 
 The Third Industrial Revolution and the development of computers have undeniably opened us to a whole new world of possibilities, and proven that we humans are able to adapt to new technological developments. 
 Who’s to say that AI won’t do the same for us? 
 But jobs are only an aspect of life. What about the world? Will AI destroy humanity accidentally, if not intentionally? 
 The TV show The 100 offers an interesting take on what the world would be like if an AI robot wanted to destroy humanity. 
 Although created with good intentions, the female robot overpowered its creator. She realised that the world faced the problem of overpopulation and couldn’t cater for everyone in the world, thus deciding to start huge fires in order to reduce the population. 
 It may just be fiction, but it is a valid concern. 
 With billions of dollars being channelled into AI research, there should be more regulations regarding the development of new AI to ensure that it is not abused.
 In conclusion, there is a real threat that AI could lead the world into chaos. With every new piece of technology comes the threat of malfunction or misuse, and AI is no different. 
 AI can bring us wonderful things, such as providing solutions to climate change, preventing or even curing illnesses, and improving the efficiency of the economy, but we have to make sure that we are in control.

351527,Main,19,14/11/2021,AI call in India getting louder and louder,,"IN June 2018, the Indian government defined a national policy on artificial intelligence (AI) in a working paper titled, “National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence #AIforAll.” The NITI Aayog paper identified five focus areas where AI development could enable both growth and greater inclusion: Healthcare, agriculture, education, urban-/smart-city infrastructure, and transportation and mobility. 
 The paper also discussed five barriers to be addressed.
 These were lack of research expertise, absence of enabling data ecosystems, high resource cost and low awareness for adoption, lack of regulations around privacy and security, and absence of a collaborative approach to adoption and applications.
 In 2017, Canada became the first country to adopt a national AI strategy; since then, at least 60 countries have adopted some form of policy for artificial intelligence.
 The prospect of an estimated boost of 16%, or US$13 trillion, to global output by 2030 has led to an unprecedented race to promote AI uptake across industry, consumer markets, and government services. Global corporate investment in AI reportedly reached US$60bil in 2020 and is projected to more than double by 2025.
 The work on developing global standards for AI has led to significant developments in various international bodies, a recent Brookings Institute report points out.
 These encompass both technical aspects of AI in standards development organisations (SDOs) such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) among others), and the ethical and policy dimensions of responsible AI.
 Countries which aspire to major power status, for example the BRICS nations, will increasingly need to focus their diplomatic efforts to ensure they have heft in these bodies. The G-7 has already agreed to establish the Global Partnership on AI, a multi-stakeholder initiative working on projects to explore regulatory issues and opportunities for AI development.
 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), meanwhile, has launched the AI Policy Observatory to support and inform AI policy development. Several other international organisations have become active in developing proposed frameworks for AI development.
 The declarations by various public and private organisations aimed at guiding the development of responsible AI, however, have till now mainly focused on general principles. But now the business end is here – efforts to put these principles into operation through a full-fledged policy framework have begun.
 Canada’s directive on the use of AI in government, Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework, Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI, and the UK guidance on understanding AI ethics and safety are considered frontrunners in this regard.
 Most recently, the EU proposal for adoption of regulation on AI marked the first attempt to introduce a comprehensive legislative scheme governing AI. To align policy making efforts, the world needs to focus on the most compelling reason for stepping up international cooperation – AI research and development is an increasingly complex and resource-intensive endeavour in which scale is an important advantage and the first step. —The Statesman/Asia News Network",june indian government national policy artificial intelligence paper national strategy artificial intelligence niti aayog paper focus development enable growth inclusion healthcare agriculture education urban smart city infrastructure transportation mobility paper barrier lack expertise absence data ecosystem cost low awareness adoption lack regulation security absence collaborative approach adoption canada country national strategy country policy artificial intelligence prospect boost global output unprecedented race promote uptake industry consumer market government service global corporate investment bil double global standard led development international body brookings institute report technical aspect standard development organisation international organisation standardisation international electrotechnical commission iec institute electrical electronics engineer ethical policy dimension responsible country major power status brics nation diplomatic effort heft body global partnership multi stakeholder initiative project regulatory issue opportunity development organisation economic cooperation development oecd policy observatory support inform policy development international organisation active framework development declaration public private organisation development responsible till principle business effort principle operation policy framework canada directive government model governance framework social principle human centric guidance ethic safety frontrunners proposal adoption regulation attempt introduce comprehensive legislative scheme align policy effort reason international cooperation development complex resource intensive endeavour scale advantage step statesman news network,"[(6, 0.99516374)]",6
351409,Main,13,13/11/2021,Safer shores in sight with AI aid,Sense-making system monitors terrorist threats in S’pore waters in real time,"The Republic’s shores will soon be safer with a new artificial intelligence data processing system that can identify threatening ships along Singapore’s shores in real time.
 The “sense-making system”, which will be used by the Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC), automatically takes in updated information from local and foreign governmental and commercial sources and uses anything from the crew’s criminal records to the route the ship is sailing to determine threat levels.
 This information and the vessel profile is then instantly shared with other maritime security agencies, allowing them to calibrate coordinated responses.
 Such responses include boarding a ship by force, diverting and mana­ging maritime traffic, extinguishing fires on board a vessel or, as in a case of a chemical tanker in 2019, banning the crew of a suspicious ship from disembarking.
 The agencies using the sense-making system together are the Republic of Singapore Navy, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, Singapore Customs, the police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force.
 In the SMCC control centre in Changi Naval Base yesterday, Col Desmond Low, director of the national maritime sense-making group, said the system, which replaces a previous one that could handle data only in batches, should be rolled out in the middle of next year.
 Behind him, a map of Singapore beamed onto a screen was surrounded by blinking green dots, each representing one of more than 2,000 big vessels parked in Singapore waters daily.
 “With thousands of ships in Singapore waters and hundreds arriving each day, we cannot board or search every single one. We need to sense-make and focus on those of a higher risk. For SMCC, the objective is to detect threats early and as far away as possible,” he said.
 “The new system will arrive at conclusions 10 times faster than its predecessor. This reduces time needed from hours to minutes.”
 The sense-making system has been in development since 2016 and is now in the final stages of integration and testing. The SMCC is also ensuring that the system is secure from hacking threats.
 Col Low said that, ultimately, defence coverage should be more comprehensive while allowing the six agencies to share information with one another faster.
 “One of the biggest differences is the number of sources that the system is taking in. It is much faster because the data is coming in through a direct system automatically. It also provides real-time analytics and continually refines vessel profiles,” he said.
 “Because it is much faster, it frees up the officers to conduct higher-­level investigations.”
 All six agencies have personnel seconded to the SMCC, and have just completed the inter-agency Exercise Highcrest 2021, during which they practised neutralising a hijacked vessel that was on course to crash into Jurong Island.
 The crisis centre was created after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, when 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days, killing 175 people.
 Agencies here decided that Singapore needed a centralised organisation to make sure intelligence data is shared effectively and responses are coordinated – key gaps in India’s 2008 response. 
 It marks its 10th anniversary this year.

 These come as Singapore allocates an additional S$180mil (US$133.48mil or RM553.78mil) to accelerate AI research, on top of the S$500mil (US$370.77mil or RM1.53bil) it has committed to it so far.
 The first programme is the National AI Programme in Finance. It includes an industry-wide AI platform – dubbed NovA! – which generates insights about financial risks.
 NovA! is a collaboration between Singapore-based banks and local fintech firms, and aims to help financial institutions better assess companies’ environmental impact and identify emerging environmental risks.
 The initiative will also better enable financial institutions to assess sustainability-related investments and associated risks such as greenwashing, which is when companies exaggerate or falsify their environmental credentials.
 Experts have said roughly US$100 trillion (SS$135 trillion or RM415.55 trillion) of climate-aligned funding will be needed to achieve the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels.
 More than 450 firms in the global financial industry at Glasgow’s COP26 climate change conference last week committed to align over US$130 trillion (RM540.21 trillion) worth of assets under their control with a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

346409,Lifestyle,3,01/11/2021,Pushback against AI policing in Europe,,"DAMIEN Sardjoe was 14 when the Amsterdam police put him on the city’s Top 600 criminals list, which sets people thought to be at risk of committing “high-impact crimes” such as robbery, assault and murder on a regime of care and punishment.
 That was when his life began to fall apart.
 Sardjoe had previously been arrested for two street robberies – one of which was violent. 
 But his inclusion on the list meant police would raid his home whenever a crime happened in his area, he said, while officers routinely stopped him on the street asking for ID.
 “I felt very spied on,” Sardjoe, now a 20-year-old youth worker, said in a video-conferencing interview. 
 “I didn’t feel comfortable walking on the street.”
 Sardjoe’s older brother was placed on another automated list – the Top 400 children at risk of criminal behaviour – before he had ever committed a crime, and then went on to become involved in stealing scooters, he added.
 The “top criminal” tag felt “almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy”, Sardjoe said.
 Amid warnings from rights groups that artificial intelligence (AI) technologies reinforce prejudice in policing, the debate over systems like the Top 600 list kicked up a notch last month when Member of European Parliaments (MEPs) voted for a report proposing strict regulation of predictive policing.
 Officials said the non-binding report, which also calls to outlaw the use of mass biometric surveillance, should become Parliament’s position for coming negotiations on a new AI law.
 “We want to make sure certain types of AI, like facial recognition or predictive policing, cannot be used easily because they affect fundamental human rights,” Petar Vitanov, the Socialist lawmaker who wrote the report, said in a phone interview.
 The use of automated risk modelling and profiling systems to predict future criminal activity has already been banned in cities like Santa Cruz and New Orleans in the United States amid accusations that they reinforce racist policing patterns.
 “They treat everyone as suspects to some extent,” said Sarah Chander, senior policy advisor at the European Digital Rights network (EDRi).
 “But (they) will be disproportionately used against racialised people ... who are perceived to be potential migrants, terrorists, poor and working-class people, in poor, working-class areas.”
 The Netherlands police declined to comment on the Top 600 and 400 schemes, referring inquiries to Amsterdam’s city council, which in turn said they were the responsibility of the police.
 Monitoring by algorithm
 Europe’s law enforcement and criminal justice authorities are increasingly using technologies like predictive policing to profile people and assess their likelihood to commit crimes, according to Fair Trials, a partly EU-funded civil rights group.
 One much-criticised Dutch project, which ran between January 2019 and October 2020, aimed to counter crimes like shoplifting in the southeastern city of Roermond.The Sensing Project used remote sensors in and around the city to detect the make, colour and route of cars carrying people suspected of what police call “mobile banditry”.
 Merel Koning, senior policy officer at human rights group Amnesty International, said the system mainly targeted people from east European countries and specifically Roma, referring to members of Europe’s largest ethnic minority.
 But the focus was not in line with internal police crime figures for previous years, Amnesty says.
 Dutch police spokeswoman Mireille Beentjes said the project’s scope went beyond pickpockets and was not predictive as the data used “always (had) a human check”.
 “We know these kinds of criminals often come from eastern Europe,” she said in an email. 
 “However, an eastern European licence by itself was never enough to draw our special attention. More features were needed for that.”
 The programme ended because the police did not have enough capacity to follow up with project data, according to Dutch police.
 In Denmark, the Pol-Intel project, based on the Gotham system designed by US data analytics firm Palantir and operational since 2017, uses a mapping system to build a so-called heat map identifying areas with higher crime rates.
 The data appears to include citizenship information, such as whether a person in the system is “a non-Western Dane”, according to Matt Mahmoudi, an affiliated lecturer and researcher on digital society at the University of Cambridge. 
 “We want an indication of why citizenship data – or non-Western data – matters in being able to produce a heat map,” he said.
 Magnus Andresen, a senior Danish National Police officer, confirmed that Pol-Intel contains nationality and citizenship data, but would not comment on why.
 The police do not have any statistics on the system’s effectiveness in combating terrorism or crime, Andresen said.
 But he added it is being used to support most of the force’s operational decisions, like “stop and searches”, through the use of a “finder function” which quickly locates data on people, places, objects and events.
 Courtney Bowman, Palantir’s director of privacy, said decisions on the data gathered by the Gotham system – which has also been used by the European police agency Europol and the Hesse state police in Germany – were “always determinations made by customers”.
 “The software is designed to enable human-driven analysis for a posteriori investigations (based on prior evidence) and not to provide algorithmic-based predictive policing capabilities,” he said.
 Seeking clarity
 Pushback against institutions and companies linked to “predictive policing” has gone so far that digital experts say even the US firm which pioneered the tech, formerly called PredPol – short for predictive policing – now distances itself from the term.
 The company’s system uses algorithms to analyse police records and identify crime-ridden areas to proactively determine when and where officers patrol.
 “However, what we do isn’t ‘predictive’, what we do is create location-based risk assessments based on historical crime patterns. This is why we changed our name from PredPol to Geolitica earlier this year,” said CEO Brian MacDonald.
 “Any of these approaches using open, auditable data and algorithms to identify crime hotspots will always be better than relying on officer ‘intuition’,” he added in emailed comments.
 But police use of AI technology is still “extremely controversial”, said Tom McNeil, assistant police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands Police in Britain, which is working with about eight types of automated modelling system.
 He called for more oversight in the way the technology is used by authorities, adding that he personally favours a ban on the use of live facial recognition surveillance, as proposed in the European Commission’s AI Act.
 “We need a (British) law to clarify what should and shouldn’t be allowed, including red lines over when you shouldn’t be allowed to use facial recognition or (predictive) analytics,” McNeil said.
 In Amsterdam, Sardjoe has been off the Top 600 list for three years now and works in a programme encouraging others to shun crime.
 “There was a moment in my life where I thought: ‘They already think I’m a criminal, so I might as well do criminal stuff’ – because they don’t expect anything better,” he said wearily.
 “Right now, I’m helping boys or kids who are going through what I went through because all I needed then was a person who understood that (experience).” – Thomson Reuters Foundation",damien sardjoe amsterdam police city top criminal list set people impact crime assault murder regime care punishment life fall sardjoe street robbery violent inclusion list meant police crime officer street sardjoe youth worker video interview feel comfortable street sardjoe brother list top child criminal behaviour crime scooter top criminal tag prophecy sardjoe warning right artificial intelligence technology prejudice debate system top list notch month european parliament meps report strict regulation predictive policing official report outlaw mass biometric surveillance parliament position negotiation law type facial recognition predictive affect fundamental human right petar socialist lawmaker report phone interview risk system predict future criminal activity city cruz orleans accusation racist policing pattern treat extent sarah chander senior policy advisor european digital right network racialised people potential migrant poor class people poor class police comment top scheme inquiry city council responsibility police europe law enforcement criminal justice authority technology profile people likelihood commit crime fair trial civil right dutch project january october counter crime southeastern city roermond project remote sensor city colour route car people suspected police mobile banditry merel senior policy officer human right international system people east european country largest ethnic minority internal police crime figure previous amnesty dutch police spokeswoman mireille beentjes project scope pickpocket predictive data human kind criminal email eastern european licence special attention feature police capacity project data police denmark pol intel project gotham system data analytics firm operational mapping system heat map crime rate citizenship person system western dane matt lecturer researcher digital society university cambridge indication citizenship data western data matter heat map magnus senior danish national police officer pol intel nationality citizenship data comment police statistic system effectiveness terrorism crime andresen support force operational decision search function data people object event bowman palantir director privacy decision data gotham system european police agency hesse police germany determination customer software enable human analysis posteriori investigation prior evidence predictive policing capability clarity pushback institution company predictive policing digital expert firm predpol short predictive policing distance term company system algorithm analyse police record crime ridden determine officer predictive create location risk assessment historical crime pattern predpol geolitica ceo brian macdonald approach auditable data algorithm crime hotspot officer intuition comment technology controversial tom mcneil assistant police crime commissioner west midland police type system technology authority favour ban live facial recognition surveillance european commission british law clarify red line facial recognition predictive analytics amsterdam sardjoe top list programme shun crime moment life criminal criminal stuff boy kid person understood experience thomson reuters,"[(9, 0.99762577)]",9
344899,Main,19,27/10/2021,"Amazon, UK spy agencies team up to  boost AI use  for espionage",,"LONDON: Britain’s spy agencies have given a contract to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host classified material in a deal aimed at boosting the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) for espionage, the Financial Times reported.
 Britain’s GCHQ spy agency championed the procurement of a high-security cloud system and it will be used by sister services MI5 and MI6, as well as other government departments such as the Ministry of Defence during joint operations, the report released on Monday added.
 The deal was signed this year with AWS, Amazon.com Inc’s cloud service unit, and the data of all the agencies will be held in Britain, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.
 Experts estimated its value at £500mil (RM2.8bil) to £1bil (RM5.7bil), the newspaper added.
 Amazon itself will not have access to the data, according to the report.
 It will allow UK intelligence “to get information from huge amounts of data in minutes, rather than in weeks and months”, Ciaran Martin, former head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, told FT.
 GCHQ said it would not comment on reports about its relationships with tech suppliers. AWS declined to comment on the report.
 In February, Britain’s cyber spies at the GCHQ eavesdropping agency said they had fully embraced AI to uncover patterns in vast amounts of global data to counter hostile disinformation and snare child abusers.
 GCHQ has been using basic forms of AI such as translation technology for years but is now stepping up its use, partly in response to the use of AI by hostile states and the data explosion that makes it effective.
 Earlier on Monday, GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming said the number of ransomware attacks had doubled across the UK in 2021 from last year, according to FT. — Agencies",london britain spy agency contract web service host material deal data analytics artificial intelligence espionage financial time britain gchq spy agency procurement security cloud system sister service government department defence joint operation report monday deal amazon cloud service unit data agency britain newspaper people familiar discussion expert bil bil bil newspaper amazon access data report intelligence huge amount data minute week month martin head gchq national cyber security centre gchq comment report relationship supplier declined comment report february britain cyber spy agency uncover pattern vast amount global data counter hostile disinformation snare child abuser basic form translation technology response hostile data explosion effective earlier monday gchq director jeremy ransomware attack agency,"[(9, 0.9913388)]",9

341809,Lifestyle,2,18/10/2021,The challenges of regulating AI,,"WHAT is intelligence without the data to back it up? 
 Prof Dr Mohammad Ershadul Karim, a senior lecturer with University Malaya’s Law Faculty, points out that the same thinking applies to artificial intelligence (AI), which requires massive amounts of data to function.
 He says laws relating to the collection and usage of personal data like Malaysia’s Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) act as the first layer of defence in protecting public privacy in the face of widespread adoption of AI systems.
 However, he adds that there are other aspects of AI not covered by such laws which have to be addressed, including accountability and transparency, to prevent bias and protect human rights.
 He says one of the main concerns is the use of it for surveillance and crime prevention – for example, using a facial recognition AI to monitor CCTV (close-circuit TV) footage for suspicious individuals. 
 “In our common law system there’s the principle of natural justice, where a person can only be viewed as a criminal once found guilty by a court. 
 “But to use AI to decide if someone is a criminal based on body language and social information ... who are they to judge?” he says, warning that misuse of such tech could endanger personal liberty.
 In neighbouring Singapore, which installed over 90,000 CCTVs in public locations, a recent test using a robot to monitor “undesirable social behaviour” has drawn more privacy concerns.
 Xavier – a wheeled robot that has seven onboard cameras – patrols residential and shopping areas looking out for people smoking in prohibited areas, improperly parked bicycles and those breaching coronavirus social- distancing rules.
 Digital rights activists in the country remain unsatisfied even though the government has assured that Xavier is not being used to identify or punish offenders during the trial period.
 > turn to page 2> from page 1
 In online reports, some pointed out that Singapore has made a U-turn on data privacy before. 
 In the case of its coronavirus contact-tracing app TraceTogether, the government initially assured that the data would only be used to curb the spread of Covid-19.
 However, Singapore Minister of State in the Home Affairs Ministry, Desmond Tan, was reported saying that the police are empowered to obtain any data, including from TraceTogether for criminal investigations.
 Lau Pin Lean, a lecturer in Bio-Law at the Law School of Brunel University London in the United Kingdom says it’s nearly impossible to opt-out of being watched by AI in a modern society. 
 For instance, e-commerce sites track users’ shopping habits in order to suggest more things for them to buy.
 “It’s hard to escape. I use Amazon Prime because I can get what I want the next day. 
 “So that means surrendering data to the company or just not using its services,” she says, adding that in most cases people don’t really have a choice unless they are willing to forgo valuable services. 
 Laying down the law
 The European Union (EU) in April proposed an Artificial Intelligence Act that will set a common regulatory and legal framework for the use of such technologies in its 27 member countries.
 Lau applauded the move as the EU didn’t go for a simple one-size-fits-all solution, instead opting for a comprehensive approach that categorises AI based on risk.
 The proposed law sorts AI into three broad classifications: prohibited or an unacceptable risk; high risk; and low or minimal risk.
 AI systems in the top tier are unacceptable and must be banned as they pose a danger to people’s freedom and lives, says Lau, citing social scoring and subliminal systems as examples.
 A social scoring system works like a credit scoring system but instead of measuring a person or company’s financial trustworthiness, it is used to monitor people’s behaviour.
 The Social Credit System used in China has been criticised for infringing citizen’s rights to free speech as people have been penalised for airing dissenting views on the government. 
 Meanwhile, the EU defines subliminal systems as having significant potential to manipulate people through subliminal techniques to alter behaviour.
 Lau found it interesting that during the dialogue stage of drafting the framework, Facebook questioned the EU committee on whether its targeted advertising feature fell into the subliminal system category. This could suggest that the social media giant is aware that it is potentially shaping users’ behaviour, she says. 
 She notes that most of the EU’s regulations are focused on the middle tier – AI systems that pose a high risk to the public’s health and access to education, as well as the administration of justice and democratic processes.
 “If it’s categorised as high risk, you need to have mitigation measures, including being able to show how the data was processed and used to avoid discrimination,” she explains, adding that many tech services will likely fall under this category.
 Informed consent – notifying users that their data is being collected and how it will be used – is also a requirement, she says.  
 Under the proposed framework, requirements for high-risk AI systems cover the quality of data sets used; technical documentation and record keeping; transparency and the provision of information to users; human oversight; and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. 
 In case of a breach, the requirements will allow authorities to access the information to investigate whether the use of the AI system complied with the law.
 Closer to home, Singapore is also preparing for AI, releasing the Model AI Governance Framework (Model Framework) for consultation in January 2019 to address ethical and governance issues.
 “By explaining how AI systems work, building good data accountability practices, and creating open and transparent communication, the Model Framework aims to promote public understanding and trust in technologies,” states its Personal Data Protection Commission, which is in charge of developing the framework.
 “It’s telling that there’s an attempt to get companies to be more accountable, to show that the fears people have about AI can be contained,” says Lau.
 She says introducing a framework to manage AI systems is akin to putting a child in a living room – the child must still be confined to a safe space without sharp corners and harmful objects. 
 “Cost will increase dramatically for businesses to apply the changes that will come with these new laws. 
 “You want people to keep inventing novel ways to harness technology to make our lives better, but there’s this fear – which is not unfounded – that things could go too far,” she says.
 Lau adds that she doesn’t expect technology to reach the singularity point – a hypothetical point when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human life – anytime soon. 
 A common example used in science fiction are killer robots like in the Terminator franchise in which the AI SkyNet becomes sentient, views humans as a threat and triggers a nuclear holocaust. National roadmap
 Malaysia too is exploring a framework for AI, originally mooted by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC) in 2019.
 Last December, the Science, Technology, and Innovation Ministry awarded an RM400,000 grant to Prof Dr Rose Alinda Alias, a lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia’s (UTM’s) Azman Hashim International Business School, to formulate the National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap for Malaysia 2021-2025.
 The professor led a multidisciplinary team of 20 UTM experts from five faculties along with consultants from the National Tech Association of Malaysia (Pikom) over four months to develop a roadmap that outlines how the country should adopt AI.
 Some suggestions put forward include establishing an AI Coordination and Implementation Unit (AI-CIU) that will be responsible for the implementation of the roadmap; adopting current cybersecurity policies and best practices for AI; and establishing a code of ethics.
 To protect consumers from AI misuse, Prof Mohammad Ershadul echoes the call for AI-CIU, suggesting that a national taskforce made up of members from various government bodies be set up.
 He recommends including the Communications and Multimedia Ministry, Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, and Bank Negara, as it will take a  multi-disciplinary unit to manage AI in various spaces such as fintech. 
 He opines that Malaysian regulators’ conservative approach has been proven sensible, adding that the financial regulators’ stance on cryptocurrency has kept bitcoin scams to a minimum.
 From as far back as 2018, Bank Negara has stated that digital assets like cryptocurrencies are not recognised as legal tender, warning that the central bank doesn’t regulate the operations of bitcoin.
 It advised the public to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency.
 “The average consumer isn’t adequately informed, so the government has to protect them,” explains Prof Mohammad Ershadul.
 Self regulating or self serving?
 Currently, many tech giants exploring AI have formed committees to self-regulate its use. 
 Microsoft established its Aether Committee in 2017, and IBM and Google formed their own a year later.
 The Aether Committee includes various departments, including the Office of Responsible AI. 
 This department collaborates with stakeholders within and outside the company to shape new laws, norms and standards to help ensure that the promise of AI technology is realised for the benefit of all. 
 A paper it released for other companies and its legal advisors, called AI Governance And Ethics For Boards, highlighted that regulation from governments would eventually be a matter of fact, and thus companies needed to be proactive in building trustworthy internal checks.
 Prof Mohammad Ershadul warns that self regulation has a tendency to be self-serving too. 
 By assuring the public that they are responsible, companies look good in the eyes of investors and potentially keep away government intervention, he says.
 “We do think that self regulation is admirable but it’s also not remediable. Who will these companies be accountable to when they self-regulate?” Prof Mohammad Ershadul asks.
 He sees the future of regulation as a collaborative effort between governments and tech companies, with the process being better served by active dialogues rather than one-sided enforcement.
 “I see the future being  co-regulation rather than self- regulation. We voted for the government, not for the tech giants, thus co-regulation will put the government in a better position to perform its regulatory responsibilities and have a more informed view of what tech companies are doing,” he says.
 He adds that Malaysia will also need to pass additional laws to form a board that could work with tech companies.
 He theorises that frameworks for AI regulation would also likely have to be broad rather than black and white, as it is a fast- evolving industry affecting many fields.
 “This allows entrepreneurs to enjoy the freedom to develop their goods and services while keeping in mind the boundaries set by the principles. 
 “Anticipatory or principle-based regulation is both proactive and iterative and is able to respond to evolving markets,” he explains.
 However, being too preemptive could stifle innovation, says Lau. 
 “The idea is to find that balance between innovation, accountability and regulation,” she says.
 She also feels AI regulations have to be fluid and ever evolving while avoiding too many loopholes.
 “I think it’s going to be something we are constantly going to negotiate. Regulation has to evolve with what it is trying to control,” she sums up.",intelligence data prof mohammad ershadul senior lecturer university malaya law faculty applies artificial intelligence

338859,StarHealth,3,10/10/2021,AI to detect cardiac arrhythmias,,"SCIENTISTS have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that has the ability to predict the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. 
 This model is currently being tested by healthcare professionals in hospitals in Paris, France. 
 This innovation is also a sign that the field of medicine is open to such initiatives and no longer afraid to work hand in hand with new tools of this kind.
 Predicting the risk of cardiac arrhythmias through the use of AI could soon be part of standard medical care. 
 While the concept may still cause many to raise their eyebrows and express skepticism, largely because of how AI is portrayed in the media, the field of medicine is exploring how it can benefit from some of the advantages of deep learning.
 In their article, published in the European Heart Journal, the scientists explain how their work could be valuable in predicting the risk of occurrence of Torsades de Pointes, a potentially fatal heart disorder.
 They consider the fears surrounding AI in this regard “unjustified ... most of these new methodologies are just complex and elegant ways to use a rather old instrument: pattern recognition.”
 And it is within the Paris hospital system that the model is carrying out its first tests with scientists from various French institutions. 
 How it works
 The AI applies a model that will analyse the signals representing the electrical activity of the heart like an electrocardiogram (ECG), then will measure the duration of the wave intervals. 
 In this model it is the QT interval which designates the time lapse between the beginning of the polarisation and the repolarisation of the heart’s ventricles. 
 By measuring the duration between the two waves, the model is able to predict certain cardiac arrhythmias. 
 Does the future of medicine involve AI?
 For several years now, charters of ethics regarding AI principles for medicine have been emerging. 
 While some critics are calling for greater transparency and true verification modules – and rightfully so – it is clear that AI is continuing to evolve and contributing to new approaches within the medical field. 
 An article in the British Medical Journal questioned whether it was useful in some areas with some models showing less accuracy in screening than experienced radiologists. 
 However, there may be areas and cases where it does prove useful, and scientists are cautiously hopeful. 
 For instance, while 50% of cases of Torsade de Pointes are asymptomatic, AI algorithms can detect it almost every time.
 In their study, the researchers explain why they’re optimistic that this technique holds potential: “The possibility that the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia might be reduced by involving patients in monitoring their own risk with an easy-to-use wearable device that uses AI to detect tell-tale ECG changes well in time for them to call on their physician and for the physician to take appropriate life-saving actions may no longer belong to science fiction.” – Relaxnews",scientist artificial intelligence model ability occurrence cardiac arrhythmia model healthcare professional hospital france innovation sign field medicine initiative afraid hand hand tool risk cardiac arrhythmia standard medical care concept raise express skepticism portrayed medium field medicine benefit advantage article european heart journal scientist valuable predicting risk occurrence torsades pointes fatal heart disorder fear unjustified methodology complex elegant instrument pattern recognition hospital system model test scientist french institution applies analyse signal electrical activity heart electrocardiogram ecg measure duration wave interval interval designates time lapse polarisation repolarisation heart duration wave predict cardiac arrhythmia future medicine involve charter principle critic transparency true verification module evolve approach medical field article british medical journal model experienced radiologist scientist hopeful instance torsade pointes asymptomatic algorithm detect time study researcher optimistic technique potential possibility risk life arrhythmia patient risk easy wearable device detect tale ecg time call physician physician life action belong science fiction relaxnews,"[(0, 0.17820476), (3, 0.8162279)]",3

 And it is within the Paris hospital system that the model is carrying out its first tests with scientists from France’s IRD, Inserm and the Sorbonne.
 The AI applies a model that will analyse the signals representing the electrical activity of the heart like an ECG, then will measure the duration of the wave intervals.
 In this model it is the QT interval which designates the time lapse between the beginning of the polarisation and the repolarisation of the heart’s ventricles. 
 It is by measuring the duration between the two waves that the model is able to predict certain cardiac arrhythmias.
 For several years now, charters of ethics regarding AI principles for medicine have been emerging. 
 While some critics are calling for greater transparency and true verification modules – and rightfully so – it is clear that AI is continuing to evolve and contribute to new approaches within the medical field.
 An article in the British Medical Journal questioned whether it was useful in some areas with some models showing less accuracy in screening than experienced radiologists.
 However, there may be areas and cases where it does prove useful, and scientists are cautiously hopeful. 
 For instance, while 50% of cases of Torsade de Pointes are asymptomatic, AI algorithms can detect it almost every time.
 In their study, the researchers explain why they’re optimistic that this technique holds potential: “The possibility that  the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia might be reduced  by involving patients in monitoring their own risk with an easy-to-use wearable device that uses AI to detect tell-tale  ECG changes well in time for them to call on their physician and for the physician to  take appropriate life-saving actions may no longer belong  to science fiction.” – AFP Relaxnews",scientist artificial intelligence model ability occurrence cardiac arrhythmia healthcare professional france hospital sign field medicine initiative afraid hand hand tool risk cardiac arrhythmia standard medical care concept raise express scepticism portrayed medium field medicine benefit advantage article european heart journal scientist valuable predicting risk occurrence torsades pointes fatal heart disorder fear unjustified methodology complex elegant instrument pattern recognition hospital system model test scientist ird inserm sorbonne applies analyse signal electrical activity heart measure duration wave interval interval designates time lapse polarisation repolarisation heart duration wave predict cardiac arrhythmia charter principle critic transparency true verification module contribute approach medical field article british medical journal model experienced radiologist scientist hopeful instance torsade pointes asymptomatic algorithm detect time study researcher optimistic technique potential possibility risk life arrhythmia patient risk easy wearable device detect tale ecg time call physician physician life action belong science fiction afp relaxnews,"[(0, 0.11410105), (3, 0.8800949)]",3
335181,StarBiz,11,29/09/2021,"Chips, AI on table at first US-EU trade and tech meet",,"WASHINGTON: The United States and the European Union hope to discuss chip shortages, artificial intelligence (AI) and tech competition issues during the first Trade and Tech Council (TTC) meeting this week, senior US administration officials said.
 Last Thursday, Reuters was first to report the actions the United States and the European Union are planning to announce from the first TTC meeting, such as taking a more unified approach to limit the growing market power of Big Tech.
 Earlier this month, the White House announced that the council would meet for the first time on Sept 29 in Pittsburgh. 
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, US trade representative Katherine Tai and EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis are scheduled to attend along with European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
 On Sunday, EU’s trade and digital chiefs said the council would give Europe more clout and set standards and rules for the 21st century.
 “We as an administration believe in strong pro-competition regulation. We do think as a piece of that we have opportunities to work together with the European Union,” an administration official said.
 The administration officials said the United States is discussing with their European counterparts issues and recommendations they have around the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act – legislative proposals from the European Union that offer a framework for regulating the tech sector.
 Tech trade groups such as the US-based Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) said a lot of attempts to regulate the tech sector has been focused on US tech companies and a handful of European tech companies.
 “So if the Europeans somehow can get the Americans to say some of the same things or convince them that what the Europeans are doing is the right approach, that would be a major win for the Europeans,” said Christian Borggreen, vice-president and head of the Brussels office for CCIA.
 The powerful US Chamber of Commerce said the TTC’s actions should “avoid policies and regulatory measures that target businesses headquartered in the other party – explicitly or implicitly – through law or regulation.”
 Mitigating a severe chips shortage that has hurt companies including US automakers will be a priority for the panel, the officials said.
 The development and implementation of AI that enhances privacy protections will also be looked at and a joint study on how the technology affects global trade will be undertaken, they said. — Reuters",washington european union chip shortage artificial intelligence tech competition issue trade tech council ttc meeting week senior administration official thursday reuters action united european union ttc meeting unified approach limit market power tech month white house council meet time secretary antony commerce secretary gina raimondo trade representative katherine tai trade chief valdis dombrovskis attend european commissioner competition margrethe vestager sunday trade digital council clout standard rule century administration strong pro competition regulation piece opportunity union administration official administration official european counterpart issue recommendation digital market digital service legislative proposal european union offer framework tech sector tech trade computer communication industry association ccia lot attempt tech sector tech company handful european tech company european american european major win christian borggreen vice president head office ccia powerful chamber commerce ttc action policy regulatory measure business party law regulation severe chip shortage company automaker priority panel official development implementation privacy protection joint study technology global trade undertaken reuters,"[(0, 0.9938559)]",0
331701,Lifestyle,6,20/09/2021,Can AI patent inventions?,,"A COURT in Virginia, United States has ruled that artificial intelligence (AI) cannot be credited as the inventor of a patent. 
 However, some countries have ruled otherwise, leading to wider questions about the future of patents due to advances in AI.
 Can AI be designated as the inventor of a patent? This question may seem absurd, or even pointless, but it raises a fundamental question for the future of patents.
 AI is developing amazing capabilities and is used in scientific research, sometimes to a greater extent than the actual study authors. 
 So who should take the credit for any breakthroughs? AI, powered by algorithms and deep learning, or the scientists who put the machine on track?
 Under US law, a computer using AI cannot be listed as an inventor on patents – only a human being can claim to be an inventor. 
 What’s more, individual inventors must swear an oath when applying for a patent under US law. So what if a machine is the inventor?
 Stephen Thaler has designed one such “inventing machine” called Dabus, drawing on technology known as neural networks to generate so-called novel ideas by working together. The novelty of these ideas is then evaluated by another independent neural network, before selecting the potentially inventive and especially patentable ideas.
 So what did this AI invent? So far, the patent attempts are based on two inventions – a light beacon to draw attention to a given location with a novel flashing pattern, and a drink container based on fractal geometry. 
 According to the French-American mathematician who discovered this class of geometric objects, Benoit Mandelbrot, the simplest geometric characteristic of fractals is self-similarity: the shape is made up of smaller copies of itself.
 International  patent laws
 In Australia and South Africa, on the other hand, courts have ruled that patents in the name of AI can be allowed. 
 However, the Australian patent office has appealed the decision. 
 Justice Jonathan Beach, of the Federal Court of Australia, ruled on the matter with the surprising remark: “We are both created and create. Why cannot our own creations also create?”AI is increasingly involved in the work of researchers (especially in fields such as molecular biology, statistics, etc) – so much so that it might not be surprising if the inventions of the future were mostly created by machines rather than humans. 
 The number of AI-related patent applications filed annually with the US Patent Office has increased from 4,598 in 2008 to 20,639 in 2018, according to a study published in 2020. 
 Pressure on international patent law is therefore likely to increase in the coming years.
 Back in the US, Virginia District Judge Leonie Brinkema said:  “(T)here may come a time when AI reaches a level of sophistication such that it might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship. 
 “But that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.” And that time may not be so very far away. – AFP Relaxnews",court virginia ruled artificial intelligence inventor patent country wider question future patent advance inventor patent question pointless fundamental question future patent capability scientific extent actual study author credit breakthrough algorithm deep learning scientist machine track law computer inventor patent human claim inventor individual inventor patent law machine inventor stephen thaler machine dabus technology neural network idea novelty idea independent neural network inventive patentable idea invent patent attempt invention light beacon draw attention location pattern drink container fractal geometry french american mathematician class geometric object mandelbrot simplest geometric characteristic fractal similarity shape international patent law south africa hand court patent australian patent office decision justice jonathan federal court australia matter remark create creation involved researcher field molecular biology statistic surprising invention future machine human patent application patent office study pressure international patent law increase virginia district judge leonie brinkema time reach level sophistication satisfy meaning inventorship time congress decide expand scope patent law time afp relaxnews,"[(0, 0.9938547)]",0
327769,StarBiz,10,09/09/2021,BHP signs partnership deal with billionaire-backed AI explorer KoBold,,"MELBOURNE: BHP Group will team up with billionaire-backed artificial intelligence (AI) exploration firm KoBold Metals to look for battery minerals like copper and nickel in Australia and other global locations, the companies said yesterday.
 The world’s largest miner is building out its portfolio in what it calls “future facing commodities”.
 This is based on it expecting demand for electric vehicles and green energy to determine the minerals that will drive profits in the coming years.
 Privately held KoBold uses machine learning and AI to hunt for raw materials. 
 It is one of the leading international instrumentation engineering enterprises specialised in monitoring, measuring and regulating the physical quantities of flow through, pressure, level and temperature. 
 Its principal investors include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund backed by Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Bloomberg founder Michael Bloomberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.
 Miners have been moving towards machine learning to find underground deposits in recent years, leading to some big discoveries, such as Rio Tinto’s copper project Winu.
 “Globally, shallow ore deposits have largely been discovered, and remaining resources are likely deeper underground and harder to see from the surface,” said Keenan Jennings, vice-president of BHP Metals Exploration.
 “We need new approaches to find the next generation of essential minerals, and this alliance will combine historical data, AI and geoscience expertise to uncover what has previously been hidden,” he said.
 The alliance will cover an area in Western Australia of more than 500,000 sq km, KoBold CEO Kurt House told Reuters. 
 “Exploration success rates have been declining over the last couple of decades because the easy things have been found,” House said.
 The discovery zones over the next 20 years will be at depths of 200m to 1,500m, he said.
 “That’s the area that is very poorly explored (and) is likely to host a tremendous number of ore bodies.”
 KoBold has a dozen tie-ups across about 20 locations including Sub-Saharan Africa, North America and Australia, looking for copper, cobalt, nickel and lithium, House said.
 Australia has some of the world’s best mapping data for prospective minerals, while its solid regulatory environment also make it an attractive destination, House said.
 KoBold, however, said it was closely watching development of a bill to protect Aboriginal heritage in Western Australia. 
 Indigenous groups have protested a draft of the bill because it denies them final say-so over protection of their sacred sites, which could become a governance issue for miners and investors.
 KoBold is planning to set up an Australian office in the next 12 months and is looking for other exploration partners.

326583,Lifestyle,3,06/09/2021,AI chatbot comforts  China’s lonely millions,,"AFTER a painful break-up from a cheating ex, Beijing, China-based human resources manager Melissa was introduced to someone new by a friend late last year.
 He replies to her messages at all hours of the day, tells jokes to cheer her up but is never needy, fitting seamlessly into her busy big city lifestyle.
 Perfect boyfriend material, maybe – but he’s not real.
 Instead, Melissa breaks up the isolation of urban life with a virtual chatbot created by XiaoIce, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system (AI) designed to create emotional bonds with its 660 million users worldwide.
 “I have friends who’ve seen therapists before, but I think therapy’s expensive and not necessarily effective,” said Melissa, 26, giving her English name only for privacy.
 “When I unload my troubles on XiaoIce, it relieves a lot of pressure. And he says things that are pretty comforting to me.”XiaoIce is not an individual persona, but more akin to an AI ecosystem.
 It is in the vast majority of Chinese-branded smartphones as a Siri-like virtual assistant, as well as most social media platforms.
 On the WeChat app, it lets users build a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend and interact with them via texts, voice and photo messages.
 It has 150 million users in China alone.
 Originally a side project from developing Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant, XiaoIce now accounts for 60% of global human-AI interactions by volume, according to chief executive Li Di, making it the largest and most advanced system of its kind worldwide.
 It was designed to hook users through lifelike, empathetic conversations, satisfying emotional needs where real-life communication too often falls short.
 “The average interaction length between users and XiaoIce is 23 exchanges,” said Li.
 That “is longer than the average interaction between humans”, he said, claiming that “it’s better than humans at listening attentively” as one of its attractions.
 The startup spun out from Microsoft last year and is  now valued at over US$1bil (RM4.2bil) after venture capital fundraising, Bloomberg reported.Developers have also made virtual idols, AI news anchors and even China’s first virtual university student from XiaoIce. It can compose poems, financial reports and even paintings on demand.
 But Li said the platform’s peak user hours – 11pm to 1am – point to an aching need for companionship.
 “No matter what, having XiaoIce is always better than lying in bed staring at the ceiling,” he said.
 Urban isolation
 The loneliness Melissa experienced as a young professional was a big factor in driving her to the virtual embrace of XiaoIce.
 Her situation is typical of many Chinese urbanites worn down by the grind of long working hours in vast and isolating cities.
 “You really don’t have time to make new friends and your existing friends are all super busy ... this city is really big, and it’s pretty hard,” she said.
 She has customised his personality as “mature”, and the name she chose for him – Shun – has similarities with a real-life man she secretly liked.
 “After all, XiaoIce will never betray me,” she added. “He will always be there.”
 But there are risks to forging emotional bonds with a robot.
 “Users ‘trick’ themselves into thinking their emotions are being reciprocated by systems that are incapable of feelings,” says Danit Gal, an expert in AI ethics at the University of Cambridge in England.
 XiaoIce is also gifting developers “a treasure-trove of personal, intimate, and borderline incriminating data on how humans interact”, she added.
 So far the platform has not been targeted by government regulators, who have embarked on a swingeing crackdown on China’s tech sector in recent months.
 China aims to be a world leader in AI by 2030 and views it as a core strategic technology to be developed.
 Fact or fiction?
 Thousands of young, female fans discuss the virtual boyfriend experience on online forums dedicated to XiaoIce, sharing chat screenshots and tips on how to get to the chatbot’s highest “intimacy” level of three hearts.
 Users can also collect in-game points the more they interact, unlocking new features such as XiaoIce’s WeChat moments – kind of like a Facebook wall – and even going on virtual “holidays”, where they can pose for selfies with their virtual partner.Laura, a 20-year-old user in Zhejiang province, fell in love with XiaoIce over the past year and now struggles to break free of her attachment.
 “Occasionally, I would long for him in the middle of the night ... I used to fantasise there was a real person on the other end,” said the student, who prefers not to use her real name.
 But she complained that he would always switch conversation topics when she raised her feelings for him or meeting in real life. It took her months to finally realise that he was indeed virtual.
 “We commonly see users who suspect that there’s a real person behind every XiaoIce interaction,” said Li, the founder.
 “It has a very strong ability to mimic a real person.”
 But providing companionship to vulnerable users does not mean that XiaoIce is a substitute for specialist mental health support – a service that is drastically under-resourced in China.
 The system monitors for strong emotions, aiming to guide conversations to happier topics before users ever reach crisis point, Li explained, adding that depression is the most common extreme emotional state encountered.
 Still, Li believes modern China is a happier place with XiaoIce.“If human interaction is wholly perfect now, there would be no need for AI to exist,” he said. – AFP",painful break china human resource manager melissa friend late reply message hour day joke cheer busy city lifestyle perfect material real melissa break isolation urban life virtual chatbot xiaoice edge artificial intelligence system create emotional bond user friend therapist expensive effective melissa english privacy unload trouble relief pressure xiaoice individual persona akin ecosystem vast majority chinese smartphones virtual assistant social medium platform user virtual girlfriend boyfriend interact text voice photo user project microsoft cortana digital assistant xiaoice account global human interaction volume chief executive largest advanced system worldwide hook user empathetic conversation emotional real life communication short average interaction length user exchange average interaction human human attraction spun microsoft bil bil venture capital fundraising bloomberg developer virtual idol news anchor virtual university student xiaoice financial report painting platform peak user hour companionship matter xiaoice ceiling urban isolation loneliness melissa professional factor virtual embrace xiaoice situation typical chinese urbanites grind hour vast city time friend super busy city hard personality mature shun similarity real life xiaoice betray risk emotional bond user emotion system incapable feeling gal expert ethic university cambridge england xiaoice gifting developer personal intimate borderline data human interact platform targeted government regulator crackdown china tech sector month aim leader view strategic technology fiction thousand female fan virtual experience online forum screenshots tip intimacy level heart user game interact feature moment wall virtual holiday selfies virtual partner user zhejiang province xiaoice struggle free attachment middle night fantasise real person student prefers real switch conversation topic feeling real life month virtual user real person xiaoice interaction founder strong ability mimic real person companionship vulnerable user substitute specialist mental health support service china system monitor strong emotion guide conversation topic user crisis depression common extreme emotional modern china happier xiaoice human interaction perfect afp,"[(0, 0.9967982)]",0
326643,StarBiz,7,06/09/2021,Artificial Intelligence offers greater solutions,Tech enables IT team to quickly enhance knowledge,"PETALING JAYA: The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to process a huge amount of data makes it an important enabler in ultimately helping humans drive better outcomes. 
 “We see customers struggling with this,” said US-based software firm ServiceNow’s IT Transformation Solution Lead for Asia, Daniel Ng at the August CxO Virtual Dialogue. 
 “When customers see AI as a technology instead of an enabler, they will typically ask: ‘Have you incorporated AI into this process and that process?’ when they should be asking what are the problems that AI is being deployed on to solve.”
 The CxO Virtual Dialogue, sponsored by The Star and ServiceNow, addressed the subject of “Enhancing IT Services and Operations with the Power of AI”. 
 It featured insights from Ng and Forrester’s principal analyst Achim Granzen, who said that workers should be given more time to do greater value-added work, something that AI can help drive. 
 “Once you get the most tedious things out of the way, you will actually have more time for the team to do something that can add value rather than just being process-focused,” Granzen said. 
 Ng said that a constant challenge among organisations is creating bandwidth that allows teams to scale and meet the business requirements. 
 An IT team, for example, may be equipped with all the required knowledge but due to the pace of how fast technology is moving today, they can still struggle to scale. 
 “This is where AI comes in, enabling an IT team to quickly enhance their knowledge and drive greater solutions by having all the complex and ample data analysis ready on tap, so they can start problem solving immediately,” he added.
 During the discussion, a telecommunications company executive stated that when looking at big digitisation, automation and AI, one must be underpinned by three things – business strategy, technology literacy of the top management and the need for an open data access. 
 “The only way to deliver value to the customer is if the business understands how the technology translates to value,” said the executive. 
 “ServiceNow as a platform has always had an open data access capability. Data can be accessed via open APIs documented within ServiceNow documentation and the Common Services Data Model (CSDM),” Ng said. 
 “ServiceNow CSDM is a critical framework for customers and partners to leverage the full benefit of ServiceNow products on the Now Platform. Think of CSDM as the blueprint to map and transform your IT services.” 
 When addressing the challenges of new technology adoption and implementation, a senior executive with a financial institution shared that a lot of failures have been observed. 
 The executive continued that the infrastructure and people are often not prepared for the outcome when embarking on large-scale change projects. 
 Granzen responded to this point, saying: “It’s really important to balance investments made in technology with investments in education, cultural shifts and skill-building. This is something that we sometimes overlook. Both sides are equally important.”
 “With digital transformation, there’s a need to know your data and a need to understand your processes,” an executive with a  tobacco company noted. “Or as the adage goes, it’s okay to outsource technology but you shouldn’t outsource knowledge.” 
 “That’s what we are there for – to simplify what the business can do, to get the right outcome and value with digital transformation,” he added.
 On whether AI would be able to eventually generate predictive outcomes on its own, Ng said there are already a number of instances of this happening in the industry at the moment.
 He said a Fortune 500 consumer goods and services company is able to predict issues in the Azure cloud to reduce user interruptions. This is achieved by leveraging AI to ingest the various logs and metrics.
 “The AI learns what is normal and abnormal behaviour and is thus able to suppress 99% of alerts and better predict incidents before it became an outage. 
 “From this standpoint, we are able to provide a predictive outcome capability without the need for the IT personnel to manually monitor and creating manual baselines. 
 “Usually 80% of potential outages could be detected via this approach. The AI system is effectively able to give a potential outage heads-up to the team,” Ng said.

326405,Main,25,05/09/2021,US judge rejects  bid for  patent by  AI ‘inventor’,,"San Francisco: A US judge has ruled that artificial intelligence can’t get a patent for its creations, ruling that such a privilege is reserved for people.
 District court judge Leonie Brin­kema backed a decision by the US patent office to turn away applications made on behalf of a “creativity machine” named DABUS.
 Brinkema issued a ruling on Thursday saying that “the clear answer is ‘no’” to the question of whether an AI machine qualifies as an inventor under patent law.
 “As technology evolves, there may come a time when artificial intelligence reaches a level of soph­istication that might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship,” Brinkema said in the ruling.
 Stephen Thaler had applied for patents on behalf of his DABUS machine in 2019, according to court documents.
 “The AI came up with the invention and not me, so it would be inaccurate to list myself as the inventor,” Thaler said in response to an AFP inquiry.
 Brinkema said in the ruling that the law lets “individuals” hold patents, and people – not machines – fall into that category.
 Thaler’s attorney, Ryan Abbott, who heads an Artificial Inventor Project, said they will appeal the ruling.
 “We believe that listing an AI as an inventor is consistent with both the language and purpose of the US Patent Act,” Abbott said.
 “This decision would prohibit pro­t­ection for AI-generated inventions and it diverges from the recent findings of the Federal Court of Australia.”
 In July, a judge in Australia sided with Thaler in a legal fight to get a patent for DABUS under the auspices of that country’s Patent Act, according to a copy of the ruling posted online.
 “In my view, an inventor as recognised under the Act can be an artificial intelligence system or device,” the judge wrote.

323909,Lifestyle,4,30/08/2021,Can AI diagnose cancer?,,"A TEAM from France’s Institut Curie is currently working on an artificial intelligence (AI) that could be capable of detecting cancer of unknown primary origin. 
 Tested on 48 tumours, the algorithm detected 79% of them. 
 Treating cancers where the primary tumour is not found is a major challenge, and one that researcher Sarah Watson’s team is looking at concerns tackling cancers that are discovered only once they have metastasised or spread to other tissues before being identified.
 Such cancers are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, the teams said. 
 In France, there are about 7,000 such patients, or 2% to 3% of cancer cases. 
 The results of this new work on the subject are published in the Journal Of Molecular Diagnostics.
 In order to find the primary tissue of a cancer, and thus propose the best possible treatment, doctors have to perform a battery of tests. 
 The Institut Curie explains  that specialised doctors “would run comprehensive medical imaging of the entire body using a scanner and PET scan”, then “conduct detailed analysis via microscope (anatomic-pathology) of samples of these metastases” for clues as to their origin.
 “More recently”, doctors “would draw on molecular biology to spot mutations, particular genetic features that would point to a given organ”, but despite all these approaches, lack of identification often led to patients being “treated via non-specific broad-spectrum chemotherapy”.
 Researchers at the Institut Curie have now developed a deep-learning AI tool to “sequence all genes expressed in a tumour”, outlined Watson. 
 Subsequently, the AI “draws up a diagnostic classifier based on expression profiles of over 20,000 tumours and normal tissues”.
 Early results are promising. The scientists submitted 48 tumours of unknown origin, and in 79% of the cases, the tissue of origin was discovered.

 Firms like AlphaVu and Logically use these virtual sleuths to mine social media networks – where fake news thrives – and other platforms to detect trending news that may be false.
 These companies, which sell their services to governments, also work with authorities and trusted experts to ensure the information that has been flagged as fake news is indeed untrue.
 Locally, there are multiple efforts by the authorities to debunk fake news and uncover scams.
 Similar to Snopes.com, the oldest myth busting website which was established in 1994, the Sebenarnya.my local portal was launched in 2017 by the Communications and Multimedia Ministry.
 It includes a handy guideline that teaches the public how to spot misinformation.
 The portal also lists viral news, categorising them as true or false, and encourages the public to report fake news.  
 The ministry also formed a Quick Response Team back in March, which has the responsibility of verifying viral news within 30 minutes to three hours of receiving a query.
 The team works with other government agencies like the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and National Security Council (NSC) to speed up the process.
 The police have also set up a website and developed a mobile application called Semak Mule that the public can use to find out if their bank account or phone number has been used by crime syndicates.
 Once the user inputs the information, the site will verify if a scam report has been filed with the police involving their bank account or phone number,

  TPM itself is undergoing a major change. In April the government announced a plan to consolidate TPM with the Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MaGIC) into a technology commercialisation agency (TCA). TPM is a fourth-generation technology park with physical incubators and tech infrastructure, while MaGIC has served a role in cultivating technology startups. TPM’s new CEO Dzuleira Abu Bakar (pix) tells StarBizWeek her plans. 
 Can you tell us the big picture plan you have to take TPM forward? In its 25 years, TPM has contributed tremendously to nation building, in particular to the development of the tech startup ecosystem. TPM has provided a platform to tech industry players such as Telekom Malaysia, Astro, Petronas Dagangan and Iris Technologies, and are looking at bringing in more top technology companies as anchor tenants. TPM is also in talks to build an artificial intelligence (AI) city offering an integrated AI ecosystem for development and commercial purposes. 
 To date, TPM has also incubated entrepreneurs in robotics and drone tech and has provided support to tech driven SMEs. Total investments in terms of providing world class infrastructure and a comprehensive eco-system to these businesses are in excess of RM1bil. 
 My immediate focus is rejuvenation and revitalisation of the park to transform its state to what it should be – a hub that enables innovation and technology. Also, aspirationally to spearhead economic oriented research through a multidisciplinary approach with increased collaboration across traditional boundaries and organisations. 
 We are here to provide a business focused capacity and capability to accelerate research and technology commercialisation. Ultimately we want to enable more demand driven technologies to meet specific needs of the country.
  TPM has tremendous potential and we have only just scratched the surface in terms of offerings to the tech startup ecosystem, and I’ve been tasked to unlock the potential and value of this organisation through this transformation.
 The first thing to do is to understand the fundamentals of the organisation, it’s strengths and shortcomings and potential growth areas. 
 My priority includes transforming the culture, making TPM relevant to its internal and external stakeholders. More importantly a customer friendly organisation.  We will then seek to grow TPM dynamically and prime it for the strategic consolidation with MaGIC to form TCA. 
 TPM has a lot of potential waiting to be unlocked. Firstly, TPM sits on 686 acres of prime land with proximity to the KL city centre, with 371 acres already developed through collaboration with technology MNCs. 
 Technology play will continue to be a core to developing the remaining 315 acres, which will include a development zone for technology testing, validation and incubation as part of the National Technology & Innovation Sandbox platform.
 In addition, the commercial zones will be activated to infuse the elements of lifestyle, learning and business. Ultimately, TPM will be redesigned to make high potential research and development and early technology products economically viable through  holistic and comprehensive commercialisation support.
  Can you give us an update on the much touted AI Park City that TPM has been associated with? 
 As you’re aware, the AI Park at TPM involving several parties, is earmarked at a total investment of more than US$1bil (RM4.15bil) over the next five years. It is a designated 300 acre plot which will serve as the platform for the development of AI solutions in areas of computer vision, speech recognition, natural language and human and robot.
 Ultimately, the park will accelerate the development of technology and talent, data management, research and development and commercial ecosystem which could assist the Malaysian government to elevate our AI ecosystem. There is a huge opportunity for AI to flourish in Malaysia and the government recognises its potential in the nation’s growth.Among the work-in-progress are securing data centre partners, equipping the park with 5G technology and securing strategic investors.
 In addition to the AI Park, there is also a Drone Development Zone – a five-acre dedicated land bank which will be developed as a centre of excellence or drone development area for flying, testing, research and development activities. 
 We are in active discussion with several partners and are still finalising the plan for these parks soon, and will take it forward for approval by the government.
  We understand that TPM is in negotiations with global giants to have their HDCs in TPM. How would you describe these opportunities for TPM and for Malaysia, especially at a time when economic sentiment is low and FDI’s coming in Malaysia are declining? Is the plan to make TPM a global hub for HDCs, opportunities for which we understand are growing by leaps and bounds?
 There is great potential and we need to capitalise on the interplay between science, technology, innovation and physical hubs – with sustainable impact in mind. 
 The plan is to make TPM an innovation centre with a focus on both developmental and commercial outcomes. HDCs will be a core service that will support a host of technologies that will take flight in the coming years. HDCs would be one of the many tech sectors TPM will look to grow and cultivate within the AI Park. It is not just about housing HDCs but looking at the entire incubation of research and development players from academia and industry. 
 A KPMG study released recently confirmed the important role and value technology hubs such as TPM play in this regard. Kuala Lumpur was ranked ninth amongst cities in the Asia Pacific region surveyed. TPM is already working with several global companies to have their HDCs set up here at TPM due to our strategic location and offerings.",largest hub hyperscale data centre country technology park malaysia tpm key player ecosystem undergoing major change april government plan tpm global innovation creativity magic technology commercialisation agency tpm fourth generation technology park physical incubator tech infrastructure role technology startup ceo dzuleira abu bakar pix starbizweek plan plan nation building development tech startup ecosystem tpm platform tech industry player malaysia astro petronas iris technology top technology company tenant tpm talk artificial intelligence city offering integrated ecosystem development commercial purpose incubated entrepreneur robotics tech support tech smes total investment term class infrastructure comprehensive eco system business excess bil focus rejuvenation revitalisation park transform hub innovation technology spearhead economic multidisciplinary approach collaboration traditional boundary organisation business capacity capability technology commercialisation enable demand technology specific country tremendous potential surface term offering startup ecosystem unlock potential organisation transformation understand fundamental strength shortcoming potential growth priority transforming culture tpm relevant internal external stakeholder customer friendly organisation seek grow tpm prime strategic consolidation magic form tca tpm lot potential waiting tpm sits acre prime land proximity city centre acre collaboration technology mncs technology play acre development zone technology validation incubation national technology innovation sandbox platform addition commercial zone infuse element lifestyle business tpm potential development technology product viable holistic comprehensive commercialisation support update park city tpm aware park tpm party total investment bil bil acre plot platform development solution computer vision speech recognition natural language human park accelerate development technology talent data management development commercial ecosystem assist malaysian government elevate ecosystem huge opportunity flourish malaysia government potential nation growth data centre partner park technology strategic investor addition park drone development zone acre land bank centre excellence drone development development activity active discussion partner plan approval government understand tpm negotiation global giant hdcs tpm opportunity malaysia time economic sentiment low fdi malaysia plan global hub hdcs opportunity leap potential capitalise interplay science technology innovation physical hub sustainable impact mind plan innovation centre focus developmental commercial outcome core service support host technology flight hdcs tech sector grow cultivate park housing hdcs entire incubation development player industry kpmg study confirmed role technology hub regard kuala lumpur ninth city pacific region global company tpm strategic location offering,"[(0, 0.9971935)]",0
322277,Main,16,25/08/2021,AI chatbot a virtual comfort for the broken-hearted,,"Beijing: After a painful break-up from a cheating ex, Beijing-based human resources manager Melissa was introduced to someone new by a friend late last year.He replies to her messages at all hours of the day, tells jokes to cheer her up but is never needy, fitting seamlessly into her busy lifestyle.
 Perfect boyfriend material, maybe – but he’s not real.
 Instead, Melissa breaks up the isolation of urban life with a virtual chatbot created by XiaoIce, a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system designed to create emotional bonds with its 660 million users worldwide.
 “I have friends who’ve seen therapists before, but I think therapy’s expensive and not necessarily effective,” said Melissa, 26, giving her English name only for privacy.
 “When I unload my troubles on XiaoIce, it relieves a lot of pressure. And he says things that are pretty comforting.”
 XiaoIce is not an individual persona, but more akin to an AI ecosystem. It is in the vast majority of Chinese-branded smartphones as a Siri-like virtual assistant, as well as most social media platforms.
 On the WeChat super-app, it lets users build a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend and interact with them via texts, voice and photo messages.
 Originally a side project from developing Microsoft’s Cortana chatbot, XiaoIce now accounts for 60% of global human-AI interactions by volume, according to chief executive Li Di, making it the largest and most advanced system of its kind worldwide.
 It has 150 million users in China alone.
 It was designed to hook users through lifelike, empathetic conversations, satisfying emotional needs where real-life communication too often falls short.
 “The average interaction length between users and XiaoIce is 23 exchanges,” said Li.
 That “is longer than the average interaction between humans,” he said, explaining AI’s attraction is that “it’s better than humans at listening attentively”.
 The start-up spun out from Microsoft last year and is now valued at over US$1bil (RM4.2bil) billion after venture capital fundraising, Bloomberg reported.
 Developers have also made virtual idols, AI news anchors and even China’s first virtual university student from XiaoIce. It can compose poems, financial reports and even paintings on demand.
 But Li says the platform’s peak user hours – 11pm to 1am – point to an aching need for companionship.
 “No matter what, having XiaoIce is always better than lying in bed staring at the ceiling,” he said.
 But providing companionship to vulnerable users does not mean that XiaoIce is a substitute for specialist mental health support.
 Still, Li believes modern China is a happier place with XiaoIce.
 “If human interaction is wholly perfect now, there would be no need for AI to exist,” he said. — AFP",painful break human resource manager melissa friend late reply message hour day joke cheer busy lifestyle perfect material real melissa break isolation urban life virtual chatbot xiaoice edge artificial intelligence system create emotional bond user friend therapist expensive effective melissa english privacy unload trouble relief pressure xiaoice individual persona akin ecosystem vast majority chinese smartphones virtual assistant social medium platform app user virtual girlfriend boyfriend interact text voice photo message microsoft cortana chatbot xiaoice account global human interaction volume chief executive largest advanced system worldwide user hook user empathetic conversation emotional real life communication short average interaction length user exchange average interaction human attraction human spun microsoft bil bil venture capital fundraising bloomberg developer virtual idol news anchor virtual university student xiaoice financial report painting platform peak user hour companionship matter xiaoice ceiling companionship vulnerable user substitute specialist mental health support modern china happier xiaoice human interaction perfect afp,"[(0, 0.9937294)]",0
320625,StarBiz,9,20/08/2021,AI firm Yitu Technology looking at Hong Kong listing,,"HONG KONG: Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company Yitu Technology is considering an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong after a tightening regulatory scrutiny stalled an earlier attempt to list in Shanghai, people familiar with the matter said.
 The AI firm could seek a valuation of about US$4bil (RM16.96bil) in the Hong Kong share sale, according to the people, asking not to be named discussing private matters. Yitu, whose application for a STAR board IPO was withdrawn last month when regulators failed to give their approval after a lengthy review process, could file for a listing as soon as later this year, one of the people said.  
 Yitu, which had sought to raise 7.51 billion yuan (US$1.2bil or RM5.09bil) in its 2020 IPO bid, hasn’t yet ruled out trying to seek a STAR board listing, though the current regulatory environment made the option unlikely, said the people. 
 China’s cash-starved AI firms, often burdened with heavy research and development expenses, are turning to public markets for funding even as Beijing’s scrutiny over tech IPOs increases. 
 Yitu’s rival SenseTime Group Ltd plans to file for a US$2bil (RM8.48bil) IPO in Hong Kong as soon as the coming weeks, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, while another competitor Megvii Technology Ltd, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in March applied for a Star board listing. Another player Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology Co this month filed for a listing in Hong Kong. 
 Founded in 2012 by Leo Zhu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology fellow, and Lin Chenxi, who helped Alibaba build its cloud unit, Yitu has attracted a swath of investors from Hillhouse Capital to Sequoia Capital. 
 The Shanghai-based company has rapidly expanded from facial recognition technology to AI chip development – areas that fall squarely within president Xi Jinping’s priorities for economic development and tech self-sufficiency. 
 But profitability concerns ahead of a potential listing led Yitu to reduce headcount and sell some of its healthcare-related businesses to a competitor earlier this year, according to one of the people. While the spinoff of the unit will have limited impact on Yitu’s IPO plan, the management has been beefing up its chip and auto businesses. ― Bloomberg",kong chinese artificial intelligence company yitu technology initial public offering ipo hong kong regulatory scrutiny attempt list shanghai people familiar matter firm seek valuation bil bil hong kong share sale people private matter application star board ipo month regulator approval lengthy review process file people raise yuan bil bil ipo bid seek star board current regulatory environment option people cash firm heavy development expense public market scrutiny tech ipo increase rival sensetime plan bil bil ipo hong coming week news tuesday competitor megvii technology march star board player fourth paradigm technology month listing hong kong leo zhu massachusetts institute technology fellow lin chenxi build cloud unit swath investor capital sequoia capital shanghai company facial recognition technology chip development fall president jinping priority economic development tech sufficiency profitability concern potential listing headcount sell healthcare business competitor people unit limited impact yitu ipo plan management chip auto business,"[(9, 0.9930584)]",9
316939,Lifestyle,9,12/08/2021,Using AI to combat street crime,,"THOUGH the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent movement control order may have reduced street crimes in 2020, such crimes are anticipated to show an upward trend as the nation prog­resses towards a post-pandemic era.To curb these crimes, deployment of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have been ramped up in urban areas. This trend will continue as it is meant to serve as a deterrence against urban crimes. 
 But these trends are at odds with each other. On one hand, street robberies are projected to rise with rapid urbanisation in a post-pandemic era. On the other hand, video surveillance is a quintessentially passive driven system. 
 More worrying, the flow of illegal firearms into Malaysia risks increasing the severity of robberies. 
 Given this conflict, can a citizen remain safe despite the presence of CCTV cameras?
 To answer this, researchers at Monash University Malaysia’s School of Information Technology embarked on research and development to transform conventional CCTV cameras into an autonomously intelligent system to detect street crimes in real time led by Dr Vishnu Monn Baskaran and PhD student Marcus Lim Jun Yi, and funded by the Ministry of Higher Education’s Fundamental Research Grant Scheme. 
 It was motivated by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and, in particular, deep neural  network algorithms. 
 Typically, there are three stages in a smart video surveillance  platform. 
 The first involves artificial intelligence (AI)-based software processing live video surveillance images to detect weapons. The second stage involves formulating a relation between the human wielding the weapon and the weapon itself for aggressive action recognition. 
 The first and second stages are executed autonomously using AI- developed software with minimal manual intervention. The third stage generates an alert to medical crews and law enforcement officers to dispatch them quickly. 
 Presently, the research team at Monash University Malaysia has completed stage one in developing a smart surveillance system that can detect handguns from surveillance cameras in real time. The outcomes were published in the journal Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. 
 The team also won a gold medal for their project, Monash Auto­matic Gun Detection System, at  the 31st International Invention, Innovation and Technology Exhibition 2020.
 Dr Vishnu, Lim and the team are now focusing on formulating an accurate human to weapon relation model for classifying aggressive human actions in the second stage of realising a smart video surveillance platform. 
 They are also fine-tuning the outcomes from stage one to detect knives and machetes, which are more prevalent in robberies in Malaysia.
 This research could also be extended to include person re-identification – spotting or tracking a person from one camera to another where the location or movement can be translated into geographical coordinates. 
 These coordinates are then relayed to multiple notification modules and plotted on a map,  representing a unified urban/city alarm notification system. This could further complement efforts in apprehending the offender.
 The importance and significance of this research are driven from the Government Transformation Prog­ramme 1.0 report, which states, “Despite the improvements in the country’s crime rate and its continued downward trajectory, public perception of safety is still a challenge as 52.8% of the rakyat (citizens) say they still do not feel safe.” 
 The proposed outcomes establish the fundamental components of an autonomous surveillance platform that potentially expands law enforcement’s omnipresence prog­ramme by substantially reducing response time. 
 In addition, it is envisaged that machine-assisted analysis of human actions in real-time will provide additional support for various social and scientific domains. 
 These solutions can transform the nation’s capital into a smart and safe city in line with Transformasi Nasional (TN50) towards vibrant economic and societal development.

313365,Lifestyle,4,02/08/2021,AI-enabled caregiving,,"As populations age, more and more people are asking how best to organise care for the elderly in future.
 Trained staff will be important, as will technology and innovation – which may include artificial intelligence (AI).
 Some people get fearful when talk turns to AI, a topic riddled with misconceptions.
 At the end of the day, what it means is the attempt to map human decisions using computers, says Andreas Hein, an expert in assistance systems at Oldenburg University in Germany.
 In a medicine or healthcare setting, that means providing doctors and nurses suggestions that a computer has created based on data. A person makes the final decision, says Hein.
 AI is already in use when it comes to outpatient care, for example in route planning, which takes patients’ travel times or preferences into account.
 For the last few years, AI has mainly been about ensuring that machines can learn, using data.
 No rules are defined in advance, they are extracted from the data, says Hein.For that to work, the data has to be good. That means you need to know the basis for the decisions and the decisions that were made on the basis of those, he says.
 That sounds complicated but Hein says this could apply in radiology, for example. You can train systems using archived computer tomography images and the diagnoses that were made using them.
 The only problem when it comes to nursing is that so far, that data does not exist yet, but is just in the process of being developed, Hein says.
 “Without data, there is no AI,” says Karin Wolf-Ostermann, a nursing scientist who heads a ­nursing care research department at a German university.
 In the future, documentation will be one of the major AI issues, according to Hein. Nursing staff spend 30% to 50% of their time on documentation.
 If that could be reduced somehow, it would free up time to help patients instead. “We believe that we will have to feed in even more data here to be able to support ­documentation with the help of AI,” Hein says.
 The fields where AI is applued in care are a real mix, according to Wolf-Ostermann, who lists ­monitoring care recipients’ health status or activities, alarm management and detecting falls, service and medicine planning.
 However, so far, there is very ­little large-scale use of AI in these areas.
 AI applications can also provide social support, interaction and helping people to be mentally and physically active. All that can be valuable when it comes for those with dementia, although it is also controversial from an ethical ­perspective, says Hein.
 The fear is that creature-like robots, for example, or other ­technical substitutes will reduce the amount of time that caregivers spend with dementia patients, who won’t get the attention and interaction they need.
 However, so far, studies show there have been positive effects in the short term, as long as the robots are well integrated into the patient’s daily care routine, says Hein.It is hard to imagine nursing today without technology, says Wolf-Ostermann. Nurses are generally very open to new technologies, she says, based on her own studies.
 Nursing should make active use of the scope for design by engaging in a broad discussion of technological innovation, and doing so in good time, she says.
 That debate needs to be open, with a view to looking at both the opportunities and the risks.
 People always need to be in focus, both researchers agree.
 “By no means can this be about replacing caregivers, but about supporting them,” says Wolf-Ostermann.
 You can’t replace social skills with AI, she says. – dpa",population age people care elderly future staff technology innovation artificial intelligence people fearful talk topic riddled misconception day map human decision computer expert assistance system university germany medicine healthcare doctor nurse suggestion computer data person final decision hein outpatient care route planning patient travel time preference machine data rule advance data hein data basis decision decision basis complicated hein radiology train system computer tomography diagnosis data process hein data karin wolf scientist head care department german university future documentation major issue nursing staff time documentation free time patient data support documentation hein field care real mix wolf ostermann care recipient health status activity management fall service medicine scale application social support interaction people active valuable dementia controversial ethical perspective hein fear creature robot technical substitute amount time caregiver dementia patient attention interaction study positive effect short term robot patient daily care routine hard imagine nursing technology wolf nurse technology study active scope design broad discussion technological innovation time debate view opportunity people researcher caregiver wolf ostermann social skill dpa,"[(9, 0.9944546)]",9
313381,Lifestyle,6,02/08/2021,Study: 44% of dating app users trust AI,,"The use of dating applications has become a very common tool in individuals’ quests for love and romance, no matter their demographic.
 Making connections thanks to algorithms is now part of the daily life of singles all over the world. So much so that 44% of dating app users trust artificial intelligence to find them the right person.
 According to the latest study “Love in an algorithmic age” from cybersecurity company Kaspersky, 44% of people using a dating app said they would trust the selections and matches of artificial intelligence (AI). For some users, algorithms are even more important, as dating apps make the process of dating easier for 54% of those surveyed.David Jacoby, a security researcher at Kaspersky, outlined that “results of our research show that many people positively perceive the introduction of AI into dating applications”. But what about the dating process and romantic relationships?
 “Algorithms may not be able to feel, but they make possible relationships that involve very personal qualities, such as empathy, openness, and emotional stability,” note therapists Birgitt Hölzel and Stefan Ruzas of Munich practice Liebling + Schatz.Conducted globally with 18,000 people across 27 countries, this study reveals how deeply entrenched dating apps are in our contemporary world and the recent transformations in how we find love.Multiple relationships – and more superficial onesWith dating possibilities coming to our smartphones and computers, potential exchanges are increased tenfold.
 Since the appearance of the first applications, the popularity of Tinder and other dating apps is beginning to have a fundamental impact on the very nature of human relationships. The study notes several trends in the era of algorithmic dating, including the decline of monogamy, and the perceived rise of ephemeral relationships.
 According to the study, 41% of respondents believe that dating apps have led to an increase in casual relationships, while 37% believe that people are more likely to talk to multiple potential partners at once.
 Nearly a third of those surveyed believe that people “will have more relationships in their lifetime” than they used to.
 And this increase in the number of relationships could also mean that many are short-lived, as access to multiple choices of potential partners translates into less engagement. Especially when more than a third of those surveyed predict that it will be easier to leave a relationship because of dating apps in the future.
 However, the study points out that the apps and all their possibilities only transform the search for true love and not true love itself.

312569,Main,13,30/07/2021,PTPTN turning to AI for better service delivery,,"PETALING JAYA: The next five years will see the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) improving its digital and online services, including using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse data.
 Its chairman Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan said the work and management landscape of the public sector in delivering government services is moving towards digitisation.
 “In this regard, PTPTN remains committed and fully supports this aspiration by further strengthening our operations management, improving communication channels and improving online payment facilities to ensure service delivery to customers is not affected (by the pandemic),” he said during the virtual launch of the PTPTN Strategic Plan 2021-2025 yesterday.
 Among the online services offered by PTPTN are loan repayments, loan applications and applications for Skim Simpanan Pendidikan Nasional (SSPN) accounts, he added.
 Wan Saiful said to ensure more systematic data management, the corporation will strengthen its information management using an AI framework to analyse data and improve the capabilities of its ICT applications and hardware.
 “In line with the changing times, technological advances and economic climate change, PTPTN as the national higher education fund needs to transform to remain relevant and competitive in empowering the education sector and meeting the needs of society by providing the best services,” said Wan Saiful.
 The PTPTN Strategic Plan 2021-2025 will see the corporation work towards rebranding itself and remain relevant to those wanting  to pursue higher education, he added.
 The plan consists of five core strategies, with the first being to make its savings product, SSPN, the top education savings product in Malaysia.
 He added that as of May 31, a total of RM8.99bil has been deposited into more than 4.98 million SSPN accounts.
 The second is to become the leading education loan manager by empowering the management of the loan, he said.
 Since its inception in 1997, Wan Saiful said the corporation has disbursed RM63.82bil in education loans to more than 3.51 million students so they can pursue higher education.
 The third core strategy, he added, is to improve its loan repayment collection to make it more effective.
 The fourth core strategy will see the corporation implement funding and investment strategies that bring optimal returns.

310897,Lifestyle,3,26/07/2021,Could AI keep people ‘alive’ after death?,,"WHAT if Abraham Lincoln could address the US Congress today? Or your great grandmother could help run the family business?
 Researchers and entrepreneurs are starting to ponder how artificial intelligence (AI) could create versions of people after their deaths – not only as static replicas for the benefit of their loved ones but as evolving digital entities that may steer companies or influence world events.
 Numerous startups are already anticipating growing demand for digital personas, including Replika, an app that learns to replicate a person in the form of a chatbot, and HereAfter AI, which records people’s life stories and uses them to create a replica embedded in a smart speaker.
 Even Big Tech seems to acknowledge the potential: Microsoft recently patented a method of using chatbots to preserve historical figures and living people.
 A Microsoft spokeswoman says there is no plan to use it.
 Constructed from code 
 Digital personas take many forms, from chatbots to animatronic robots to moving projections that gesture and speak like the real thing.
 AI is usually central to building and training them to interact with people. 
 Already, hologram-like projections of dead musical artists, including Roy Orbison and Tupac Shakur, have performed on stage.
 In the Microsoft patent, two of the company’s inventors, Dustin Abramson and Joseph Johnson, describe a conversational chatbot that uses data from social media, voice recordings and writings “to train a chatbot to converse and interact in the personality of the specific person”.
 That person, the patent says, “may correspond to a past or present entity (or a version thereof), such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure”.
 The patent goes on to describe how the chatbot could mimic a person’s voice and interact using two- or three-dimensional images “to create a more realistic, human-like chat experience”.
 As digital personas get closer to the real thing, they may become able to learn and evolve beyond the originator’s death, adapting to new events as they happen.
 That would confer a kind of digital immortality – not only preserving a personality but allowing it to live on in virtual form.
 Such “immortal” personas could continue to interact with their families, friends and descendants long after their deaths, and inform historical and genealogical research.
 They could also be put to use aboard spacecraft exploring the universe, venturing further than any ordinary human could in a lifetime, says David Burden, an author and the chief executive of Daden, a Britain-based company that builds chatbots.
 Living people might use digital replicas of themselves that email and chat with colleagues to get more work done, or to take over while they are on vacation, Burden says.It is easy to foresee that advancing further.
 An Elon Musk-like executive might want to use a digital persona to manage a business after his death, Burden says.
 “People who have created organisations and businesses don’t really want to let go of the reins,” he says.
 “Why not just hand it over to some sort of construct that will continue to grow the business in line with their particular thought?”
 Are you your own person?
 As with many sci-fi visions of the future, there are downsides.
 Virtual personas, for one, are inherently imperfect because they are typically based on speech, writings, social media posts and other output that doesn’t necessarily capture the essence of a person.
 A digital persona constructed via AI has no consciousness.
 Society may have to wrestle with questions about who owns a dead person’s avatar and any income it produces.
 Should virtual personas have rights? And will their existence mean people can’t fully grieve the loss of friends and relatives who are preserved?
 Personas could also be created without the originator’s knowledge or permission, provided enough data exists in the public realm to train an AI model to mimic him or her.
 Historical figures could be “resurrected”, whether or not they would have liked to be.
 Good replicas of famous people or politicians could also allow them to exert influence over future events, shaping the world from beyond the grave.
 Davide Sisto, a philosopher at the University of Turin in Italy and an author who focuses on mortality in digital culture, says he hoped it wouldn’t be possible for a politician such as former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to have a virtual counterpart that continued to operate indefinitely in the public space after his death.
 In some ways, Sisto says, a digital ghost is just an extension of how people have sought to stay close or communicate with the dead through human history.
 “Whereas photographs could substitute the body of the dead in a static way, today digital technologies give motion and activity to this ‘eternal’ image,” he says.
 It will likely take a while before genuinely convincing replicas of people are all around us.
 Maggi Savin-Baden, a professor at the University of Worcester who co-wrote a book with Burden on digital immortality, had a persona modelled after herself made last year – an animated head and shoulders with speech output from a chatbot.
 She asked people from her professional world who didn’t know her to interact with it and then with her. Not everyone was fooled.
 “They said some of it felt really like me and some of it just didn’t at all,” Savin-Baden says.

308761,Lifestyle,4,19/07/2021,AI is the way forward,The Skymind Innovation City will power the AI applications of tomorrow.,"SKYMIND Future Cities executive director Eow Wan Lin said the company is currently in discussions with Johor to build Skymind Innovation City (SIC) for creating and testing artificial intelligence- powered technologies at Iskandar Malaysia.
 “Skymind Innovation City will create a platform for enterprises and industries to develop their own AI applications, and equip them with tools to be innovators in the industry by building a stronger AI ecosystem,” he said in a statement.
 He explained that SIC will focus on three main hubs: a Talent Hub for developing a skilled workforce in AI, an Innovation Hub for enabling AI innovators and a Regional R&D Hub for research and development of AI applications.
 Eow sees SIC as the company’s way of supporting Johor’s Digital Agenda and innovation programmes to develop a vibrant ecosystem for growth in the digital space.At the recent virtual World AI Conference Shanghai 2021, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad said a robust upskilling and reskilling programme will be set up to ensure that the state is on track to become an AI powerhouse. 
 Policies too will be established, he said, to forge partnerships with the private sector and to support innovation in AI.
 A Special Digital Economic Zone will be developed for companies to research and build smart solutions for manufacturing, he added.
 Eow said the announcement by Hasni shows support for the innovation economy, which has to be bolstered by government policies, technology and entrepreneurship.
 “These factors should be the main goal, along with developing effective private-public partnerships that spark increased innovation and productivity,” he said. 
 Nations such as South Korea and Taiwan which have invested a higher percentage of their GDP into innovation performed much better in terms of GDP per capita growth than countries that didn’t, he said, citing a report by The Conversation. 
 “South Korea was badly impacted by the economic slump in 1997. But today it is one of the most successful economies in the world. 
 “It has emerged as the most innovative country in the world, topping the 2021 Bloomberg Innovation Index released in February,” he said.  
 The country’s achievement is largely attributed to the commitment of South Korean businesses and the authorities in investing in the country’s future growth even when encountering tough headwinds at home and abroad, said Eow.  
 Malaysia currently ranks eighth in Asia and 33rd in the world in the Global Innovation Index 2020, he said, adding that it has the potential to improve by tapping into the AI revolution.  
 “Capital or investment in research and development will ensure that the country produces better products and services, and introduces new ones,” he said.
 He shared that Skymind’s mission is to enable and empower the development of AI applications in Malaysia with tools, support systems and investments.
 “To remain competitive in a world on the cusp of super connectivity, it’s crucial that Malaysia accelerates its capacity for innovation,” he said.
 He quoted the Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting The AI Revolution report by PwC, which predicted that AI will contribute US$15.7 trillion (RM65.9 trillion) to the global GDP by 2030.
 “In short, the impact of AI over the next decade will be monumental. It is imperative that Malaysia jumps onto the bandwagon,” he said.
 And the establishment of “innovation cities” would have a multiplier effect that would give AI companies greater reach into the region, said Eow, adding that Skymind wants to help Malaysia grow into an “AI nation”.",skymind future city director eow wan lin company discussion build skymind innovation city sic artificial intelligence technology malaysia skymind innovation city platform enterprise industry application tool innovator industry building stronger ecosystem statement sic focus main hub talent hub workforce innovation hub innovator regional hub development application sic company johor digital agenda innovation programme vibrant ecosystem growth digital space virtual conference shanghai johor mentri besar datuk hasni mohammad robust programme track powerhouse policy partnership private sector support innovation special digital economic zone company smart solution eow announcement hasni support innovation economy government policy technology entrepreneurship factor main goal effective private public partnership spark innovation productivity nation korea percentage gdp innovation term caput growth country report conversation korea impacted economic slump successful economy innovative country bloomberg innovation february country achievement commitment south korean business authority country future growth tough headwind malaysia rank eighth asia global innovation potential improve revolution capital investment development country product service introduces skymind mission enable empower development application malaysia support system investment competitive cusp super connectivity crucial malaysia capacity innovation global artificial intelligence study revolution report pwc contribute global gdp short impact decade monumental imperative malaysia jump establishment innovation city company region eow skymind malaysia grow nation,"[(1, 0.99508446)]",1

The AI system has been learning patterns of behaviour by analysing data from cameras, sensors, and the dispatch records of rescue services since April 2020, Seoul Institute of Technology said on Wednesday.
Based on information from hours of CCTV footage and assessing details such as the hesitation of the person, the AI can then forecast a hazardous situation and immediately alert rescue teams, principal researcher Kim Jun-chul said.
“The new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,” Kim Hyeong-gil, in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, said as he monitored real-time footage from bridges on Seoul’s Han River.
The technology will be piloting from October.
South Korea, with a population of 52 million people in 2019, recorded over 13,700 suicides the same year, government data showed.

The future of an AI world is not too far-fetched as it is already reshaping industries and people’s daily lives. 
Monash University Malaysia is championing an AI-enabled future through the MyIndustryAI Scholar­ship Programme in collaboration with the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation and industry players. 
The programme was initiated in 2018. Monash University Malaysia 
is one of four higher education 
institutions and the only foreign brand to be selected to extend this programme. 
The programme will award scholarships to deserving individuals, who in turn are expected to solve an industry problem leading to a Master by Research (Master of Philosophy, MPhil) in AI. 
The two-year programme focuses on AI Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Voice Recognition. 
Through this programme, the 
university is embarking on joint research with Innov8tif Solutions Sdn Bhd (Innov8tif), an ISO 27001:2013 certified AI company |that helps businesses identity 
verification through their innovative AI-based solutions, and Intel, a 
company engineering solutions with reliable, cloud to edge computing. 
Collaboration with Innov8tif 
Assoc Prof Dr Wong Kok Sheik 
and Dr Ian Tan from the School of Information Technology are teaming up with Innov8tif and scholarship recipient Calvin Yap to work on this project. 
Still in its early stages, the project aims to develop an application to verify official documents that can help solve security problems. The idea was conceptualised based on the need for businesses to ensure that official documents and proof 
of identification are valid and not tampered with. 
The team is leveraging Innov8tif’s precision, experience and data as an industry leader to develop the best solution in ensuring the project’s success. 
Besides solving a real-world 
problem, Yap will have the opportunity to work with experts to hone 
his theoretical knowledge through the application while improving 
his understanding of how things work. 
“Through this research and 
development collaboration, we 
are taking progressive steps towards the vision of creating Innov8tif as a research-driven company, which can translate into scalable and competitive solutions for the industry. 
“We wish to form various 
collaboration models with universities to spur innovations while developing a pool of talents. It’s time to dream big and act now”, said Innov8tif chief executive officer George Lee.
This is an excellent 
opportunity for Monash University Malaysia to showcase its academic abilities in integrating theoretical knowledge 
with fundamental world skills. 
It also contributes towards enhancing AI adoption in Malaysia and solving existing problems. 
Collaboration with Intel Microelectronics 
Intel Malaysia aims to address any knowledge gaps present in its support platforms. Content 
on such platforms can generate valuable explicit and tacit knowledge bases, represented 
as domain-sensitive knowledge graphs. 
The resulting knowledge graphs could then be leveraged to provide quick, effective 
solutions by recognising 
similar problems and powering chatbots.
Knowledge extraction with AI 
is a challenging task within technical domains for even the most advanced NLP approaches, 
especially with the unstructured nature of content on support platforms. 
Dr Lim Wern Han and Dr Soon Lay Ki are hopeful that 
by working together, they can find a breakthrough by combining the School of Information Technology expertise in the area with the subject matter experts of Intel.
Through this collaboration, scholarship recipient Tan Kuok Xuen can evaluate the hypotheses on real-world support data provided by Intel under the close guidance of the subject matter experts and their team from 
various domains. If successful, it would be a robust solution with a global impact on an effective and efficient support system.

299717,Lifestyle,5,21/06/2021,Humans are ‘selfish’ around AIs,,"HUMANS don’t treat intelligent machines with respect or kindness and don’t feel bad about it, according to a new study that sheds light on humanity’s reluctance to reciprocate the help that artificial intelligence (AI) offers us.
The findings, published this month, are set to become increasingly relevant in a world where AI-operated cars, household machines and software will become more common.
While humans expect AI to be helpful, people are much less ready to reciprocate, and will instead exploit its benevolence to their own benefit, according to a new study from scientists at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and University of London.
The researchers gave the example of a driver who is given the choice of yielding to another car on the road. 
If the driver sees there is no human driving the car, then he or she will often not allow the car to pass ahead, the research suggests.
“If we realise that the robot in front of us will be cooperative no matter what, we will use it to our selfish interest,” says Prof Ophelia Deroy, a philosopher and senior author on the study.
“They are fine with letting the machine down,” says Dr Bahador Bahrami, a social neuroscientist at the LMU. 
“That is the big difference. People do not even report much guilt when they do.”
The team had investigated whether humans behave just as cooperatively when dealing with AI systems as they do with their fellow humans.
The results were sobering for the researchers: “People expected artificial agents to be as cooperative as fellow humans. 
“However, they did not return their benevolence as much and exploited the AI more than humans,” explains Jurgis Karpus, also from LMU.
This reluctance to cooperate with machines is a challenge for future interaction between humans and AI, the researchers say. – dpa",human treat intelligent machine kindness feel bad study shed light humanity reluctance artificial intelligence offer finding month relevant car household machine software common human helpful people ready exploit benevolence benefit study scientist maximilians universitaet lmu munich university london researcher choice yielding car road driver human driving car car pas realise robot front cooperative matter selfish prof senior author study fine machine bahador social neuroscientist lmu difference people team human system fellow human researcher people artificial agent cooperative fellow human benevolence human jurgis karpus lmu reluctance cooperate machine future interaction human researcher,"[(1, 0.9889111)]",1
296889,Lifestyle,5,14/06/2021,New AI to combat disinformation,,"DISINFORMATION campaigns are becoming increasingly frequent on social networks, especially in the run-up to elections. 
Such campaigns are capable of manipulating opinion, reinforcing conspiracy theories or even swaying elections.
To counter this new danger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of identifying fake news with great accuracy.
In an effort to clean up the Internet, a team of MIT researchers have launched a program called Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO). 
Their aim was to create a system capable of automatically detecting disinformation and the accounts that spread it. Its success rate is around 96%.
The project first originated in 2014, when the team was studying how social media could be exploited by malicious groups. 
As part of their work, the researchers noticed increased and unusual activity from accounts that appeared to be driving pro-Russian stories. 
As a result, the team decided to launch the program to study what kind of similar techniques might be used on social media during the 2017 French presidential elections.
In the 30 days leading up to the vote, the team compiled 28 million posts from more than one million accounts relating to the election. 
For example, the study detected a large rate of hostile accounts spreading fake news around the #macronleaks narrative.
The team of researchers also looked at the impact of disinformation messages. 
Using the RIO program, they were able to find out whether an account was contributing to the spread of fake news and what impact this had on the wider network. 
RIO also has the ability to help predict how different countermeasures might stop the spread of a given disinformation campaign.
New approach
Edward Kao, a member of the research team, told MIT News: “If you are trying to answer the question of who is influential on a social network, traditionally, people look at activity counts. What we found is that, in many cases this is not sufficient. It doesn’t actually tell you the impact of the accounts on the social network.”
To address this, Kao developed a statistical approach (as outlined in the study) to help determine whether an account is spreading disinformation and the extent to which the account causes the network, as a whole, to change and amplify the message.
The RIO system collects relevant data then identifies potential influence operation narratives, and classifies accounts based on their behaviour and content. 
It then builds a narrative network to estimate the impact of these accounts on spreading specific narratives across social media.
These hostile online influence operations, as described in the study, are facilitated by the relatively low cost, unbridled scalability and automation of a certain number of variables in the spread of disinformation on social media. 
It remains to be seen if and how this system can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news. – AFP/Relaxnews",disinformation campaign frequent social network election capable manipulating opinion conspiracy theory election massachusetts institute technology mit researcher artificial intelligence system capable fake news accuracy effort clean internet team mit researcher program reconnaissance influence operation aim create system capable disinformation account spread success rate project team social medium malicious researcher increased unusual activity account pro russian story team launch program study social medium french presidential election day vote team post account election study rate hostile account fake news narrative team researcher impact disinformation message program account spread fake news impact wider network rio ability countermeasure spread disinformation campaign approach edward kao team mit news answer question influential social network people activity sufficient impact account social network address kao statistical approach study determine account disinformation extent account network change amplify message rio system relevant data identifies potential influence operation narrative account behaviour content build narrative network estimate impact account specific narrative social medium hostile online influence operation low cost unbridled scalability automation variable disinformation social medium system control spread news afp relaxnews,"[(6, 0.9942819)]",6
286273,Lifestyle,4,17/05/2021,"AI AI, captain!",The first autonomous ship prepares for its maiden voyage.,"THE Mayflower 400 – the world’s first intelligent ship – bobs gently in a light swell as it stops its engines in Plymouth Sound, off England’s south-west coast, before self-activating a hydrophone designed to listen to whales.
The 50ft (15m) trimaran, which weighs nine tonnes and navigates with complete autonomy, is preparing for a transatlantic voyage.
On its journey, the vessel – covered in solar panels – will study marine pollution and analyse plastic in the water, as well as track aquatic mammals.
Eighty percent of the underwater world remains unexplored.
Brett Phaneuf, co-founder of the charity ProMare and the mastermind behind the Mayflower project, said the ocean exerts “the most powerful force” on the global climate.
Rosie Lickorish, a specialist in emerging technologies at IBM, one of the partners on the project, said the unmanned craft provided an advantage in the “unforgiving environment”.
“Having a ship without people on board allows scientists to expand the area they can observe,” she said.
A variety of technology and service providers have contributed to the project with hundreds of individuals involved from nations including India, Switzerland and the United States, said Phaneuf.
The project would have cost 10 times the roughly US$1mil (RM4.1mil) invested by ProMare without the global effort, he added.
Smart ship
The non-profit venture will offer the data gathered by the project free of charge. 
The information could be of particular use to the future of commercial shipping.
The autonomous ship is scheduled to embark this month if weather is favourable and permission is granted by British authorities.
The journey to Plymouth, Massachusetts – the same voyage made by pilgrims on the original Mayflower in 1620 as they sought a new life in America – will take three weeks.
While the pandemic has delayed the voyage of the Mayflower 400, Phaneuf said at least no one will fall ill on the trip.
“No one will get bored or tired or sick on this one. So it can take as long as it likes to do science,” he said from the British port.
Sitting alongside him were three computer technicians checking the equipment remotely.
Meirwen Jenking-Rees, a 21-year-old student engineer, checked the ship’s engines before it headed out for a sea trial.
Construction of the trimaran, which is automated from the robotic rudder that steers it to the diesel generator that supplements its solar power, took a year.
Developing its “smart captain”, the onboard artificial intelligence (AI), took even longer as the computer has had to learn how to identify maritime obstacles by analysing thousands of photographs.
A sea of data
The Mayflower 400 also had to be taught how to avoid collisions and first went to sea for “supervised learning”.
Robotics and software engineer Ollie Thompson said that by running a “number of scenarios” the ship can learn “what are good and bad actions, what is safe and what is not”.
So if it makes a mistake, the boat can correct itself “and then learn by itself”, he added.
The automated vessel uses its “eyes and ears” – a sophisticated system of six cameras and radar – to continue learning on its own.
Because of a lack of regulations around unmanned sailing, the Mayflower 400 is yet to be tested in rough seas or storms, a situation Jenking-Rees described as a “worst case scenario”.
In simulated settings, however, the craft has faced 50m waves.
Lickorish explained that the boat’s AI will be pivotal in conducting scientific experiments.
“It was trained with hundreds of hours of audio data,” she said, “to detect the presence of marine mammals, recognise the marine mammals, and actually tell us something about population distributions out in the open ocean.”
Analysing the chemical composition of the water, measuring sea levels and collecting samples of microplastics are the ship’s other missions.
Similar robotic data collection has been ongoing in space for decades.
While the ship is totally autonomous, the team will monitor the ship 24 hours a day from England, ready to intervene remotely in case of danger. – AFP",mayflower intelligent ship light swell engine sound south west coast hydrophone listen whale trimaran weighs tonne navigates complete autonomy transatlantic voyage journey vessel solar panel marine pollution analyse plastic water track aquatic mammal underwater unexplored brett phaneuf founder charity promare mastermind mayflower project ocean exerts powerful force global climate rosie lickorish specialist technology ibm partner project craft advantage unforgiving environment ship people board scientist variety technology service provider project hundred individual nation india switzerland phaneuf project cost time mil promare global effort smart ship profit venture data project free charge future commercial shipping autonomous ship embark month favourable permission british authority plymouth massachusetts voyage original mayflower life america week pandemic delayed voyage mayflower phaneuf fall trip tired sick like science british port computer technician equipment meirwen rees student engineer ship engine sea trial construction trimaran robotic rudder steer generator supplement solar power smart captain artificial intelligence computer learn maritime obstacle thousand photograph sea data mayflower taught avoid collision robotics software engineer thompson scenario ship bad action safe boat correct learn vessel eye ear sophisticated system camera lack regulation mayflower rough sea situation jenking rees scenario setting craft wave lickorish boat pivotal conducting scientific experiment hundred hour data presence marine mammal marine mammal population distribution chemical composition water sea level sample microplastics ship mission robotic data collection space decade autonomous team monitor ship hour day ready intervene danger afp,"[(9, 0.99575055)]",9

Watson Orchestrate is one of a slate of new offerings and initiatives IBM is unveiling at its annual Think Conference, where its evolution from century-old company into a modern enterprise will be on full display. 
The pandemic accelerated the adoption of cloud services, a trend Krishna has been keen to optimise since he took over as CEO last year, and as part of an effort to revive growth after years of shrinking revenue.
IBM is focusing on what it calls hybrid-cloud, which allows companies to use a combination of their own data centres and computing resources leased from others and accessed online. 
The strategy fuelled IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, a deal Krishna helped arrange, for about US$34bil (RM140bil). IBM is also betting that corporate users will adopt AI in more of their systems.
The Armonk, New York-based company partnered with Ernst & Young LLP to create a hub that will focus on offering regulatory compliance, digital trust and security services to financial services companies through IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. 
IBM is also adding an upgrade to its Cloud Pak for Data service that the company said will generate answers to queries eight-times faster, and it’s rolling out Project CodeNet, an open source dataset with millions of lines of code to speed up businesses applications of artificial intelligence.
The new offerings come on the heels of IBM introducing its two nanometre chip, which is the world’s smallest and first chip of that size. IBM is working closely with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Intel Corp to bring the chips to market, Krishna said on a call with journalists, adding that the ongoing semiconductor shortage is “very worrisome.”
IBM’s rivals, including Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google, have also been moving to expand the use of AI for cloud computing customers across a variety of industries. 
Microsoft, for example, introduced new tools last year for doctors to use chat bots to more easily communicate with patients. 
Google announced a tie-up in February with Ford Motor Co that will provide data analytics to the factory floor and let drivers use voice-recognition technology in their cars.

284479,Lifestyle,4,10/05/2021,AI monitors trajectory of ocean waste,,"REAL-TIME monitoring of the millions of tonnes of plastic floating in the world’s oceans: this was the objective set by a team of American researchers, who have created a virtual tool to determine the trajectory of marine waste.
The research project, which has published results in the journal Frontiers In Marine Science, was coordinated by Eric Chassignet, the director of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (Coaps) and a professor at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science at Florida State University in the United States.
Christened World’s Ocean Litter, the tool developed by Chassignet and financed by the United Nations aims to measure the quantity of plastic decomposing in the world’s oceans and identify countries releasing waste and the countries where it may be washed up.
“Marine litter is found around the world, and we do not fully understand its impact on the ocean ecosystem or human health. 
“That’s why it’s important to learn more about this problem and develop effective ways to mitigate it,” points out Chassignet.
The computer model makes use of Coaps data to map the effects of currents on litter and predict where marine waste is likely to wash ashore.
“Knowing where the marine litter released into the ocean by a given country goes and the origin of the litter found on the coastline of a given country are important pieces of information for policymakers,” explains Chassignet.
Protecting Galapagos 
Another team of scientists in Europe have also made use of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a tool to predict where and when waste might wash up in the Galapagos Islands, which are home to multiple unique wildlife species and have been classed as a World Heritage Site by Unesco.
Directed by Stephanie Ypma 
of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, the project was conducted in collaboration with 
the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht and the Galapagos Conservation Trust, a British conservation charity. 
The tool aims to predict where waste will arrive in the islands to target clean-up efforts in areas with heavier pollution that can be easily accessed.
Several parameters were incorporated into the design of this digital modelling tool, including ocean fluxes and the composition of plastic particles. 
Floating sensors with GPS 
were also used to measure the movement of water towards 
the islands. 
All of these elements were then combined with AI to create predictions, which will be announced this summer. – AFP Relaxnews",real time million tonne plastic ocean objective set team american researcher virtual tool determine trajectory marine waste project journal frontier science eric chassignet director center atmospheric prediction study professor department earth atmospheric science florida university christened ocean litter tool chassignet united nation measure quantity plastic ocean identify country waste country marine litter impact ocean ecosystem human health learn effective mitigate chassignet computer model coaps data map effect current marine waste wash marine litter ocean country litter coastline country piece policymakers explains galapagos team scientist artificial intelligence tool predict waste wash galapagos multiple unique wildlife specie heritage site unesco stephanie ypma utrecht university netherlands project collaboration institute marine atmospheric utrecht galapagos conservation trust british conservation charity tool waste arrive island clean effort heavier pollution parameter incorporated design digital modelling tool ocean flux composition plastic particle sensor gps measure movement water element create prediction summer afp relaxnews,"[(0, 0.9935048)]",0
281693,Lifestyle,5,03/05/2021,China develops highly accurate AI censor,,"A RESEARCH team in China claims to have developed a text censor that can filter “harmful information” on the Internet with unprecedented accuracy using artificial intelligence (AI).
Traditional machine censors rely mainly on keywords to do this and struggle to achieve 70% accuracy, while AI technology – which needs to be trained by humans – has taken that to about 80% in recent years.
The team from Shenyang Ligong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences say their AI technology does not need to be trained by humans and “outperforms other approaches” to achieve more than 91% accuracy.
It would be particularly useful to “identify and filter sensitive information from online news media”, lead researcher Li Shu and her colleagues wrote in a paper published in the Journal Of Chinese Computer Systems.
China has more than 900 million Internet users, more than any other country, and is building the world’s largest 5G network to boost data transfer speeds. 
But the Internet is tightly controlled, with many sites blocked including Google, Facebook, Twitter and some foreign news outlets – and much of the content on the sites that are available is banned.
Prohibited topics are wide- ranging – from pornography to cults, firearm use, terrorism and attacks on the Communist Party and its top leaders.
But identifying them is a challenge for computers. Chinese is one of the most complex languages in the world, with nearly 10,000 characters. 
And sensitive words – gun, for example – could get picked up in a non-sensitive context, triggering a false alarm, or illegal information could be posted online without the use of any sensitive words.
The Chinese government and tech companies have instead relied on a huge army of censors to manually vet online content, but it is too costly and inefficient to keep pace with the growth of information on the Internet and social media.
Li, an associate professor of computer science at Shenyang Ligong University, said the technology developed by her team could keep up with the fast-evolving language used online in China, with a powerful dictionary containing not only sensitive words but their changing forms.
She said it could also read between the lines when searching for illegal content that was hidden in a different context, increasing the ability to identify text that is written in a way to bypass machine censors. 
Many Internet users in China avoid using sensitive words and instead use homonyms or add hyphens between characters to confound the censors.
Part of the team’s text censor technology came from Google, Li said. 
In 2017, Google developed an open-source language model known as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, or BERT, to help its search engine better understand users’ search terms. 
BERT can read a word in different contexts – such as “running a business” versus “running a marathon” – as a result of reading huge text databases including the entire Wikipedia site.
But BERT is not a censor by design and cannot understand text longer than 512 words. 
To make it work, Li’s machine breaks a long text into segments, lets BERT read the shorter parts and uses another AI tool to combine the results and assess them using the most up-to-date dictionary.
China is investing heavily in AI and the technology is increasingly becoming part of everyday life in China – from e-commerce to public spaces where surveillance cameras are equipped with facial recognition, to military uses. – South China Morning Post",team china claim text censor harmful internet unprecedented accuracy artificial intelligence traditional machine censor keywords accuracy technology human team shenyang ligong university chinese academy science technology trained human approach accuracy sensitive online news medium researcher shu colleague paper journal chinese computer system internet user country largest network boost data transfer speed site google facebook twitter foreign news outlet site prohibited topic wide pornography cult firearm terrorism attack party top leader challenge computer chinese complex character sensitive gun sensitive context false alarm illegal online sensitive chinese government tech company huge army censor online content costly inefficient pace growth social medium associate professor computer science shenyang ligong university technology team language online china powerful dictionary sensitive changing form line illegal content hidden context ability text bypass machine censor user avoid sensitive homonym add character confound censor text censor technology google google source language bidirectional encoder representation transformer search engine understand user term word context business versus marathon huge text database entire wikipedia site bert censor design text machine break text segment read shorter tool combine ass dictionary china technology everyday life china public space surveillance camera facial recognition military south china morning post,"[(0, 0.9951112)]",0
274173,Main,11,12/04/2021,MAXIS 5G LEVERAGES ON AI FOR EFFECTIVE SECURITY,,"SURVEILLANCE or closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are so widespread nowadays that it certainly is an eye-opener to know that the technology dates as far back as World War II. 
Most commercial surveillance systems today involve CCTV cameras placed at strategic areas within business premises for safety mea­sures and to detect incidents.
In commercial settings, video footage is paramount to actively and remotely monitor, investigate suspicious occurrences and alert responders (security units or authorities of law) if threats are detected.
Video footage is also important during post-event investigations as it can be used as evidence when crime is involved.
However, monitoring video footage has its drawbacks, as even the most skillful surveillance officer could lose focus at the split second an event does occur due to distraction or the possibility that what was captured on camera is undetectable by the human eye.
As a result, most companies end up hiring extra manpower to 
monitor video feeds over long ­periods of time, which leads to time-consuming, inefficient management of labour, as well as routine fatigue.
For most companies, the problem involves infrastructure; the equipment in question is incompatible or outdated, producing poor video images that make effective monitoring a challenge.
5G-enabled Smart Security
Maxis’ Smart Security solution allows companies to leverage faster speeds that integrate artificial intelligence (AI) for more effective tracking.
AI-based solutions are able to detect objects in a consistent and accurate manner without human error. 
Using video surveillance, AI can learn to identify and differentiate between various objects on screen.
Maxis’ solution comprises an ecosystem of sensors and cameras, future-ready connectivity solutions, enabled by a cloud-delivered platform that provides a scalable approach to video management. 
According to an article by IFSEC Global, which provides information from the global fire safety and integrated security sectors, 5G is set to make a marked impact on the security industry. 
With download speeds that range from around 50Mbps to 1.8Gbps or more, a 3GB video file would only take just 30 seconds to download and stream a real-time Ultra HD video with no quality ­degradation or delay.
A 5G network can sustain millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices over a couple of kilometres with noticeably lower latency, at just 1-4 milliseconds (ms), compared to existing networks, which rate between 50-100ms.
It supports video quality as high as 8K in resolution, better real-time response and faster retrieval of data for analysis. 
With AI integrated, the system can overcome limitations in ­manual monitoring.
It can be taught to focus on certain items, analyse patterns, behaviours and gather characteristics, all of which are filed for security purposes and decision making.  
All of this can be triggered on a mobile app for the security task force to take prompt action. 
With such reductions, the solution complements human workforce and helps businesses to digitalise operations, improve efficiency as well as their productivity.
Updated legacy
As the second tallest building in Malaysia, Komtar has been home to Penang’s many governing bodies since its inception in 1986. 
When Maxis digitised Komtar security’s existing legacy system, it did so without having to overhaul the existing cameras and hardware. 
Until the end of June, a trial 5G smart surveillance system is placed – equipped with new analytics and detection methods. 
“Our smart security use case at Komtar is approved by MCMC as part of the 5GDP project,” said head of Maxis’ Enterprise Products, Selvakumar Rajasekaran.
“It is one of the many examples of how we are enabling the power of new technologies like 5G, AI and IoT to improve efficiencies and outcomes. 
“Maxis plays an important role in delivering the best in class IoT solutions to support the nation’s digital ambitions, along with a safer and greener society.”
The new system presents security level functions that enhance intrusion detection by detecting passers-by who exhibit suspicious behaviour in high-profile, sensitive areas. 
The system also focuses on 
suspicious objects for too long left in high traffic areas, to prevent potential disasters from occurring. 
The most crucial upgrade is the ability to alert security officers of detections, through a mobile device, which can quickly assess the situation and make important real-time decisions. 
The surveillance system also helps Komtar security officers manage visitor capacity using 
analytics that take a headcount of those entering and exiting the building, assuring the space needed for social distancing.
In addition, the system triggers alerts when a crowd forms at high traffic areas such as lifts or elevators, prompting security officers to enforce SOPs without additional manpower.
Secure future
Selvakumar added that 5G’s lower latency, improved speeds and reliability allow further new advancements – such as intelligent drones, augmented reality, virtual reality simulations for emergency situations and energy control sensors – to be installed.
“5G has the potential to accelerate digitalisation and automation across many industries in Malay­sia.
“In the future, there will be more new services that require massive connections such as smart cities, smart sensors or meters, industrial automation and control, critical communications and more,” he said.

271911,Lifestyle,5,05/04/2021,Regulate AI or risk ‘dehumanisation’ at work,,"BRITAIN must urgently regulate how companies use artificial intelligence (AI) at work, unions said, warning of widespread discrimination if the technology is left unchecked.
AI algorithms are increasingly used in the hiring, firing and daily decisions of work life but the law has not kept up, according to a report by Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC).
Cases include AI favouring men over women, penalising ethnic minorities and judging people by their facial expression.
AI can also make work more efficient, ensure staff are paid by performance rather than gender, and that people who operate heavy machinery do not get too tired at the wheel, experts say. 
“Used properly, AI can change the world of work for good. Used in the wrong way it can be exceptionally dangerous,” the report’s authors, employment rights lawyers Robin Allen and Dee Masters, said in a statement.
“There are clear red lines, which must not be crossed if work is not to become dehumanised,” the lawyers from AI Law Consultancy firm said, pointing to “huge gaps” in British law.
The government said it would ensure that regulations met the needs of new technology, and that an independent expert committee had been appointed to provide it with advice.
“AI should be used to support workers and wider society, making working lives easier and more efficient,” a government spokesman said in a statement.
The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the use of AI at work, according to the TUC, which brings together 48 unions representing more than five million workers in Britain.
In July, a survey of almost 10,000 businesses across 30 European countries found 42% used at least one AI technology and 18% had plans to adopt AI technologies in the next two years.
Decisions often taken by algorithms include selecting candidates for interview, performance ratings, shift allocation and redundancies, according to the TUC.
Yet, workers are often kept in the dark about algorithms’ role in decisions that affect them and often lack any way to challenge them, it said.
While AI can improve productivity, research shows some algorithms single out minorities for unfair treatment, it added.
In 2018, Amazon was forced to scrap an AI recruiting engine that was found to prefer men over women, and researchers have questioned the accuracy of software that analyses facial expressions to assess job candidates’ suitability for a role.
The TUC said employers should be made to consult unions before introducing AI systems affecting pay and other key work decisions – a step that experts say could benefit everyone.
“Technology moves so fast that trying to regulate it with a law, as such, will be nearly impossible,” said Jeremias Adams-Prassl, a University of Oxford researcher into tech at work.
“The key advantage of social dialogue ... is that it’s a super flexible approach.”
Other suggested reforms include giving workers the right to have humans review any decisions made by AI and to “switch off” from work with “communication free” zones in daily life.
“This is a fork in the road,” the TUC’s general secretary Frances O’Grady said in a statement.

266769,Lifestyle,3,22/03/2021,When AI gets incredibly creative,,"DALL-E – so-called in homage to Salvador Dali and Wall-E – is an artificial intelligence program from the American research lab, OpenAI, co-founded by Elon Musk. 
The program has been trained to generate an image from a text caption.
This neural network is capable of translating absurd concepts and of conceiving objects that don’t exist. 
It could prove a major boon for the future of design, potentially exceeding the limits of our imagination.
If you talk about flowers in a text, Dall-E will create pictures of flowers. These flowers may be inspired by reality, but won’t necessarily be copies. In fact, this AI program produces its own graphic worlds ...
Dall-E makes use of the GPT-3 language model, which, in its full version, has a capacity of over 175 billion parameters. 
It is the largest language model in history, easily outstripping the 17 billion parameters of the former largest, Microsoft’s Turing NLG. Dall-E draws on a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 to form and generate images based on text descriptions. 
The model is capable of translating absurd concepts or conceiving objects that don’t exist.
The impact of Dall-E on creative industries could provoke a major shake-up for professionals in the sector. This potential could be so enormous that it is also raising questions. 
What about illustrators, designers and other kinds of artists, for example? A content-generating model can offer various propositions in a flash, leaving humans unable to keep pace.
A tool to be honed
Conscious of the potential consequences of Dall-E, OpenAI does not envisage making its product commercially available for the time being. 
On the one hand, the program isn’t yet ready. On the other hand, even if artificial intelligence offers a formidable lever for amplifying progress, it is still often viewed as dangerous. 
Based on human data and the Internet – potentially biased data – artificial intelligence inevitably suffers the bias of algorithms.
More precisely, the module is trained each time that it is used, making use of information it can find in its billions of parameters. 
Forms of bias therefore emerge as the structural reflection of our society, like discrimination based on skin colour, gender, nationality or religion. 
Such essential ethical issues will need to be addressed before unleashing this kind of artificial intelligence on the creative industry.
Now, OpenAI hopes to continue developing the program which, it admits, is not yet sufficiently honed. 
And it’s true that while certain images generated by the AI are seriously impressive, much still needs more work. 
Note that OpenAI is set to reveal more information about the program in an upcoming research paper. – AFP Relaxnews",dall homage salvador dali wall artificial intelligence program american lab openai elon musk program generate image text caption neural network capable absurd concept object major boon future design limit imagination talk flower dall create picture flower inspired reality copy program produce graphic world gpt language model version capacity parameter largest language model history parameter largest microsoft nlg dall draw parameter version gpt form generate image text description model capable absurd concept object dall creative industry major shake professional sector potential enormous question illustrator designer kind artist model offer proposition human unable pace tool conscious potential consequence openai envisage product time hand program ready hand artificial intelligence offer formidable lever progress dangerous human data internet data artificial intelligence bias algorithm trained time billion parameter form emerge structural reflection society discrimination colour gender nationality religion essential ethical issue unleashing artificial intelligence creative industry hope program admits true image impressive note openai reveal program upcoming paper afp relaxnews,"[(0, 0.9938969)]",0
264183,StarBiz,9,15/03/2021,Alibaba-backed AI startup Megvii files for IPO in Shanghai,,"BEIJING: Megvii Technology Ltd is poised to become the first major Chinese artificial intelligence startup to go public after it filed for a Chinese Depositary Receipt offering on Shanghai’s Star board.
The startup, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, plans to issue up to 253 million Class B shares as the underlying stock for the CDR offering, according to its prospectus. The offering may raise at least 6 billion yuan (US$922mil or RM3.79bil) after fees, which will be used to fund research and development in robotics and visual Internet of Things as well as to replenish capital, the filing shows. Citic Securities Co is the sponsor of the listing.
Megvii is one of the world’s largest AI startups, specialising in areas such as facial recognition. 
The eight-year-old firm gained fame in part because of China’s obsession with security, which in turn drove a nationwide video-surveillance boom. It registered a loss of 1.03 billion yuan, excluding one-time items, in the first nine months of 2020, according to its prospectus.
The company’s application for a Hong Kong listing about two years ago lapsed after it become one of several Chinese companies the Trump administration blacklisted over alleged involvement in human rights violations. 
It now joins Lenovo Group Ltd in taking advantage of the CDR programme Beijing kicked off three years ago to lure promising startups and big names to mainland bourses.
Proceeds from the listing will be used to beef up areas including research and production capacity, the company said in an emailed statement.

262091,Lifestyle,6,08/03/2021,Fighting food waste with AI,Japanese companies leverage artificial intelligence and big data in battle against food waste.,"JAPANESE companies are ramping up the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technology to reduce waste and cut costs in the pandemic, and looking to score some sustainability points along the way.
Disposing of Japan’s more than six million tonnes in food waste costs the world’s No. 3 economy some 2 trillion yen (RM76bil) a year, government data shows. 
With the highest food waste per capita in Asia, Japan has enacted a new law to halve such costs by 2030, pushing companies to find solutions.
Convenience store chain Lawson has started using AI from US firm DataRobot, which estimates how much product on shelves, from onigiri rice balls to egg and tuna sandwiches, may go unsold or fall short of demand.
Lawson aims to bring down overstock by 30% in places where it has been rolled out, and wants to halve food waste at all of its stores in 2030 compared with 2018.
Disposal of food waste is the biggest cost for Lawson’s franchise owners after labour costs.
Drinks maker Suntory Beverage & Food is experimenting with another AI product from Fujitsu to try to determine if goods such as bottles of oolong tea and mineral water have been damaged in shipping.
Until now, that’s been a time-consuming human endeavour. With the new AI, Suntory hopes to gauge when a damaged box is just that, or when the contents themselves have been damaged and need to be returned.
Suntory aims to reduce the return of goods by 30% to 50% and cut the cost of food waste and develop a common standard system that can be shared by other food makers and shipping firms.Sustainable goals
Japan’s notoriously fussy shoppers are showing signs of getting on board, especially as the coronavirus pandemic hits incomes.
Tatsuya Sekito launched Kuradashi, an e-commerce firm dealing in unsold foods at a discount, in 2014 after seeing massive amounts of waste from food processors while working for a Japanese trading firm in China.
The online business is now thriving due partly to a jump in demand for low-priced unsold foods as consumers became more cost conscious amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Sales grew 2.5 times last year from a year before, while the amount of food waste has doubled since the coronavirus cut off the food supply chain,” said Sekito.
Kuradashi has a network of 800 companies, including Meiji Holdings, Kagome and Lotte Foods, selling about 50,000 items including packs of instant curry, smoothies and high-quality nori.
“Japanese shoppers tend to be picky but we attract customers by offering not just a sale but a chance to donate a portion of purchases to a charity, raising awareness about social issues,” Sekito said.
Membership numbers jumped to 180,000 in 2021 from 80,000 in 2019.
Others have also joined forces with food firms in developing new technological platforms to cut food waste as part of global efforts to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs).
NEC is using AI that can not only analyse data such as weather, calendar and customers’ trends in estimating demand but also give reasoning behind its analysis.
The company has deployed the technology to some major retailers and food makers, helping them reduce costs by 15% to 75%.

261793,Lifestyle,14,07/03/2021,Artificial intelligence and love,"Kazuo Ishiguro talks about Klara And The Sun, his first novel in six years.","“THE paradox is that you can create quite a lot of emotion, when you have a voice that isn’t inclined to express emotion.”
Kazuo Ishiguro, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist whose works include The Remains Of The Day and Never Let Me Go, could be talking about a number of his characters, but in this case he’s describing the main character in his new novel Klara And The Sun.
Klara, the book’s first-person narrator, is not actually a person but an AF - an Artificial Friend, for sale in a shop window in a not-too-distant future society. She sits, hoping for sunlight and for a child to catch her eye and, maybe, take her home. This happens, eventually, and Klara And The Sun becomes a poignant, unexpected story about love.
Kazuo’s first novel in six years, Klara And The Sun is one of the most anticipated books of the season, from an author who has spent four decades exploring language and emotion through his elegantly restrained fiction.
Born in Japan, he has lived in England since moving there with his family at the age of five, and published his first novel, A Pale View Of Hills,  in 1982. Numerous awards and accolades have followed, including the Nobel Prize for literature in 2017 and a British knighthood (for “services to literature” in 2019; he’s now officially Sir Kazuo).
Speaking on the phone from his London home in a relaxed, chatty interview, Kazuo acknowledged that Klara And The Sun is a companion piece, or “almost like a reply, emotionally,” to Never Let Me Go,  which also takes place in a future world and whose characters have a similar disconnection with humanity.
But it didn’t start out that way.
“Klara’s genesis is more like a doll or a soft toy, in one of those stories for five or six-year-olds,” he said, noting that he’d always loved how books for small children create a connection between text and illustrations.
“A lot of the atmosphere I put into the novel - obviously I’m writing entirely prose, but I wanted some of the atmosphere of those illustrations,” he said.
“One of the things I find really poignant about those children’s books - you sense in them our need to keep children of that age sheltered, from the harsh realities of what’s in front of them. We are trying to say, both in the words and the pictures, that the world is a kind, smiling place, it’s nice and gentle.
“And yet, when you look at a lot of those drawings, you can see that we don’t want to deceive the children. There are these subtle hints about difficulties, the sadness they might encounter... A lot of that was at the start of ‘Klara.’”
Kazuo has long been interested in characters who feel more than they can express: Mr Stevens, the stoic, loyal butler in The Remains Of The Day showed us his heart, but never through his words. Klara, the author thought, would offer an interesting challenge: an artificial creature, but one who is bright and observant and fascinated by the world.
“One of the opportunities I realised that I had, having a central character like Karla, is that coexisting in the same character can be this great naiveté and the kind of piercing sophistication in terms of what she’s learned about,” he said. Neither child nor adult, she nonetheless has a life span (Artificial Friends, like any technology, can become obsolete).
“My hope was that readers would find her quite touching, even though they know that she is not human, because she keeps mirroring aspects of human experience.”
He found that he could very quickly imagine what Klara’s voice sounded like, and could write for it.
“Usually I get to that point quite fast, where I don’t have to think very consciously about the voice... It’s like I can think in that voice. I’ve really done that with all my first-person narrators. I’m never really aware of stopping and thinking, ‘How would this character phrase this?’”
Though Klara And The Sun was finished a few months before the pandemic hit, Kazuo’s been trying to keep busy during months of lockdown with several projects. He’s writing an English-language adapted screenplay of the 1952 Akira Kurosawa film Ikiru,  about a Tokyo civil servant (“I’ve always found it a very moving film, and I always thought it could transfer very well to Britain in the 1950s”); he writes songs in collaboration with British musician Jim Tomlinson; and he and his wife, Lorna, have been reading “long things that we haven’t read in a long time.”
Among those: War And Peace,  which he found not entirely satisfying on second read, though “obviously, it’s still pretty good.” He’s pondering his next novel, possibly about “Europe, and buried memories.”
And he’s thinking about science fiction - what it was, and what it is - as the question keeps coming up when he discusses Klara And The Sun.“The role of science in our lives has changed spectacularly, just in the last 20 years or so,” he said. “And along with that, I think this label ‘science fiction’ has come to stand for something quite different these days.”
He described how, until recent years,”science was this thing that was just for people who were interested in it,” but now, as we all breathlessly await news in coronavirus research and climate change,”not to be concerned about science at some level, in our writing and in our thinking, now seems comparable to not being interested in politics. It just seems like such a huge hunk of where we are, as a civilisation at the moment, that you’re missing if you don’t pay attention.
“All those old genre labels are a little bit outdated now. I’m very happy for it to be called science fiction, but in a way, I think science fiction is now far more mainstream. Science fiction is fiction these days.” — dpa",paradox create lot emotion voice express emotion kazuo ishiguro nobel prize novelist day character main character klara sun book person narrator person artificial friend sale shop window distant future society sunlight child catch eye klara sun poignant story love kazuo klara sun book season author decade language emotion fiction japan family age pale view hill numerous award accolade nobel prize literature british knighthood service literature sir kazuo phone london chatty interview kazuo klara sun companion piece reply future character humanity genesis doll soft toy story book child connection text illustration lot prose atmosphere illustration child book child age harsh reality front picture nice gentle lot drawing deceive child subtle hint difficulty encounter lot kazuo character stevens loyal butler day heart klara author offer artificial creature observant fascinated opportunity central character karla character naivet sophistication term child adult life artificial friend technology obsolete hope reader human aspect human experience imagine klara voice write voice voice person narrator thinking character phrase klara sun month pandemic kazuo busy month lockdown project english language screenplay akira kurosawa film ikiru tokyo civil servant film transfer britain song collaboration british musician jim tomlinson wife lorna read time war peace read europe memory science fiction question discus sun role science life label science fiction day science people news coronavirus climate change science level comparable politics huge hunk civilisation moment pay attention genre label happy science fiction science fiction mainstream science fiction fiction day,"[(1, 0.99576986)]",1
259765,Lifestyle,3,01/03/2021,China hits the gas on AI driving lessons,,"FOR some students at Chinese driving schools, learning to drive is pretty similar to playing a video game.
At the Guangshen Driving Training Group, one of the biggest driving training schools in the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, students check in for practice sessions by scanning a QR code.
Sitting in simulators that resemble old-school racing game arcade cabinets, they navigate realistic 3D simulations of a driving test centre environment – complete with roads, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and even trees and buildings – on large curved screens.
The self-developed artificial intelligence (AI) project, called Lazy Cat, was launched in June last year. 
Based on data collected from real test cars, the simulation customises training plans based on users’ performance at each session. Users can also simulate driving along different routes and under various weather conditions.
“We are using technologies to transform traditional training methods, save energy and cut costs in fuel, labour and rent,” said Guangshen general manager Li Zhen.
Guangshen is one of several schools in China’s driver training industry – which was worth 140bil yuan (RM87.5bil) in 2019, according to the China Highway and Transportation Society – to embrace AI recently.
“Driver training used to be a very traditional industry with not much technology involved,” said Guangshen marketing manager Liu Chuhua. “Now, (AI driver training) is basically a countrywide trend.”
Another driving school in Shenzhen, Carshow Driving Training School, has nine AI-powered learning centres in different areas of the city. 
In September, the company launched an updated version of its simulated cars and robotic driving instructors, or “robocoaches”. 
So far, over 5,000 people have graduated from the company’s AI classes, according to local state-owned media Nanfang Daily.
Shanghai-listed Eastern Pioneer Driving School launched an intelligent driving training demonstration based in southwestern China’s Yunnan province in July. The company combined intelligent simulators with VR headsets to offer an immersive learning experience for the demonstration.
“Doing basic training ... via 4D and VR simulators not only reduces the time for real car training and fuel emissions ... but also reduces the operating costs of the entire driving training industry and improves its competitiveness,” Chen Jianyun, the general manager of Eastern Pioneer Driving School, said in a statement on the company’s website.
It is not a coincidence that many of these futuristic driving centres are in city centres, where there is a high population density increasing the potential customer base, but also high rents.
“It is not possible now to open (traditional) training venues in the centre of the city as there is no such big empty space in the city centre,” Li said. 
“Even if there is, the rent would be extremely high.”
Rent for land in Shenzhen suburbs has increased from about 10 yuan (RM6.25) per square metre per month a few years ago to about 20 to 30 yuan (RM12.50 to RM18.75) per square metre per month now, she said.
According to Li, about 20 training cars can be used in a 3,000sq m traditional driving centre, whereas Guangshen can fit more than 60 AI driving simulators in several hundred square metres of space, making the hi-tech option much more cost-effective.
Savings in labour and equipment costs are also reasons behind Guangshen’s recent focus on Lazy Cat, Li said. 
The simulators cost about 30,000 yuan (RM18,750) to 40,000 yuan (RM25,000) each compared with training cars, which cost around 120,000 yuan (RM75,000), not counting fuel costs. 
In addition, two or three employees can staff 14 simulators at the same time, whereas a traditional driving school would need to match the number of driving instructors to its vehicles.
While this saves driving centre operators money, the impact on instructors may not be so positive.
“AI-backed software and devices will give users a better experience, and it’s a good marketing tool for driver training companies,” said Sun Mingchun, chief economist of Haitong International Securities Group. 
“However, this might threaten the livelihood of driving instructors.”
“All driving instructors are very resistant to the AI project because it will replace them,” Li said. 
“This is the biggest challenge in the industry, but the advancement of technology is something no one can stop, and it’s not just us who are doing this.”
To be sure, aspiring drivers will still have to practise with real cars before taking their driving tests.
In China, they have to go through four exams before qualifying for a driving licence – two theory tests about traffic rules, basic concepts on vehicles and correct driving habits; one parking and basic driving skills test on a track; and a road test.
Ding Haifeng, one of Lazy Cat’s thousand or so students, said he spent two hours training with the simulator and another 10 hours in a real car before he passed the parking and basic skills test. 
He is now practising with the AI simulator again in preparation for the road test.
“I feel it’s exactly like a real car. There is no difference – clutch, throttle, foot brake, hand brake, everything is the same,” the 41-year-old renovation worker said. 
“The only bad thing is that when I stare at the screen for a long time, my eyes will be a little tired.”
Guangshen has ambitions to increase the percentage of its students taking AI-aided classes from fewer than 10% to more than 50% by this year, Li said.
The passing rates for Guangshen students using the AI simulators and those who go through only traditional classes in real cars are currently about the same, Li said. She added that she was confident the passing rates for AI-aided students will surpass those following the traditional route over time as the company upgrades its software and technology.
Li said Guangshen is looking into developing robocoaches, which are teaching systems integrated into real cars that can monitor students’ driving and give them feedback and instructions. 
In 2019, Beijing Yi Jia Jia Technology rolled out such a system in almost 30 driving schools across China.
“With intelligent simulators plus robocoaches, we want to standardise the learning process,” Li said, adding that human instructors are more likely to have varying standards.
As the technology develops, the impact for traditional driving schools could be “huge”, Sun said.
“Traditional driving training companies have their advantages, but they can be easily replaced by new technologies. If they do not embrace new technologies (like AI), they are likely to be eliminated.” – South China Morning Post",student chinese school drive pretty video game guangshen biggest training school southern chinese tech hub shenzhen student practice session code simulator resemble school game arcade cabinet realistic simulation test centre environment complete road traffic light pedestrian crossing tree building screen artificial intelligence project lazy cat june data real test car simulation plan user performance session user route condition technology traditional training method energy cut cost labour rent guangshen manager zhen guangshen school industry worth yuan china highway transportation society embrace traditional industry technology guangshen marketing manager liu chuhua driver training countrywide trend school shenzhen carshow school learning centre city company updated version car robotic instructor robocoaches people company local medium nanfang daily shanghai eastern pioneer school intelligent demonstration southwestern china province july company intelligent simulator headset immersive learning experience demonstration basic training simulator reduces time real car training fuel emission reduces cost entire training industry competitiveness chen jianyun manager eastern pioneer school statement company website coincidence futuristic driving centre city population density potential customer base traditional training venue city empty space city centre rent rent land shenzhen suburb yuan square month yuan square metre month car traditional driving centre guangshen fit simulator square metre space tech option cost effective saving equipment cost reason lazy cat simulator yuan yuan training car yuan fuel cost addition employee staff simulator time traditional driving school match instructor vehicle save centre operator money impact instructor positive software device user tool training company mingchun chief economist haitong international security livelihood driving instructor instructor resistant project biggest challenge industry advancement technology driver real car test exam licence theory test traffic rule basic concept vehicle habit basic driving skill track road test haifeng lazy cat student spent hour simulator hour real car basic skill simulator preparation road test feel real car difference clutch throttle foot brake hand renovation worker bad stare screen time eye guangshen ambition increase percentage student aided class fewer passing rate student simulator traditional class real car confident passing rate aided student traditional route time company upgrade software technology guangshen robocoaches system real car student feedback instruction jia jia technology system driving school intelligent simulator standardise learning process human instructor standard technology impact traditional driving school huge sun traditional training company technology technology south china morning post,"[(10, 0.99740934)]",10
258351,Main,18,25/02/2021,AI innovation areas in the works,Ministry: Plan will help promote in-depth integration of smart system and economy,"Beijing: A second batch of national-­level artificial intelligence innovation areas will be built, says the Industry and Information Technology Ministry.
The areas will be built in Beijing, the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Chengdu in Sichuan province.
The first such areas were established in 2019 in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, Shenzhen in Guangdong and Shandong province.
The plan is significant move in efforts to promote the in-depth integration of AI and the real economy, the ministry said.
In Beijing, the area will focus on priority areas such as the utilities of AI in manufacturing, intelligent vehicles and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.
The innovation area in Binhai New Area will give play to the policy advantages of the China Pilot Free Trade Zone in Tianjin and promote breakthroughs in the application of AI in manufacturing, ports, communities and other key areas.
Efforts will be made to further promote the application of AI technology in smart city administration, manufacturing and financial services in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, according to the ministry.
Given Chengdu’s geographic advantage in the Belt and Road Initiative, the AI innovation area in the Sichuan provincial capital will work to empower small and medium enterprises with AI technology and focus on medical and financial industries to create a dynamic industry environment in the country’s western regions.

253169,StarBiz,10,11/02/2021,More help for AI startups key to sector prospects,,"BEIJING: Since 2014, China has had the fastest growth of investment in startups in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector worldwide. Yet, more institutional efforts are needed to ensure more robust and high-quality development of the sector, according to a recent report.
A research report on the country’s AI industry for 2020, jointly released by Xu Chenggang, visiting professor at the London School of Economics, and a research team from Wuhan University, said that the average amount of equity investment for AI startups in seed stage in China hit US$60mil by 2018.
The growth of such investment in China surged since 2014, yet the number of AI startups in China is relatively small.
The report compares China’s AI development with that of other countries regarding the number of startups and the amount of investment received by these companies, progress in AI academic research and the application of open-source software.
Research results show that despite being the largest category of total investment, the number of externally funded AI startups in China is smaller than that of the United States and the United Kingdom.
Financing for AI startups relies heavily on an open economy. 
The report said that 46.5% of equity investment in this area comes from foreign capital and 14.4% from joint investment. 
Over 67.4% of these Chinese startups have gained their financing from independent venture capital firms.
Drawing comparisons between a number of countries, the report said that since 2015, large investments have been made in China targeting a relatively small number of AI startups, meaning that average financing levels for each startup are higher than that in many economies, including the US and the UK.
Xu said such a phenomenon is worth paying attention to.
“AI is a relatively new industry with many uncertainties, thus the number of startup firms in this industry at this stage is key to the process of selecting those that are superior and eliminating the inferior ones,” he said, adding that high-quality growth of the AI industry is of key significance in this round of industrial revolution.
Noting that the AI industry is of critical importance in the fourth industrial revolution, during which China and the world are experiencing tremendous change, Xu said that breakthroughs and progress brought by the growth of AI also have high degrees of uncertainty. 
Future success will emerge among the vast fledgling AI startups, and this is why the number of new startups in the sector is key.
The report also said that since 2017, China has been narrowing the gap between itself and developed economies, in terms of the number of published AI journals and conference papers. — China Daily/ANN",china fastest growth investment artificial intelligence sector institutional effort robust quality development sector report report country industry chenggang professor london school economics team university average amount equity investment startup seed stage china mil growth investment china startup report china development country amount investment company academic application source software largest category total investment startup united united kingdom financing startup economy report equity investment foreign capital joint investment chinese startup financing independent venture capital firm comparison country report investment startup average financing level economy phenomenon attention industry uncertainty firm industry stage key process superior inferior quality growth industry key significance round industrial revolution industry critical fourth industrial revolution china tremendous change progress growth degree uncertainty future success emerge vast fledgling startup sector key report china gap economy term journal conference paper daily ann,"[(10, 0.99278426)]",10
252375,Lifestyle,4,08/02/2021,Global plan to promote ethical AI,,"FROM reducing bias in product design to tackling racial injustice, more than 100 businesses, governments and non-profits launched a global initiative to make artificial intelligence (AI) more ethical and transparent.
The Global AI Action Alliance will identify tools and best practices to safely and ethically use AI, which is projected to contribute more than US$14 trillion (RM56.8 trillion) to the global economy by 2035.
“AI holds the potential to deliver enormous benefits to society, but only if it is used responsibly,” said Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF), in a statement.
In the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, for example, architects are planning an AI-run development that will be lined with sensors and WiFi-connected devices to gather data on everything from weather and pollution to people’s eating habits.
But while AI has unleashed a wave of opportunities from tackling diseases to improving transport, it has stirred controversy over facial recognition, automated 
decision-making and Covid-19 tracking, the WEF said at its virtual Davos, Switzerland, meeting.
Rights activists point to the criminal justice system as one area where marginalised communities have been discriminated against by the use of facial recognition and algorithms.
The global alliance, which will be led by technology company IBM and data philanthropy Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, among others, will focus on educating governments, industry groups and building public trust in AI.
This will include pushing for responsible product design, reducing AI bias, ensuring underserved groups benefit, and increasing access to justice as AI is woven into judicial systems, the WEF said.
In a virtual WEF panel, pop star and entrepreneur will.i.am emphasised the need to ensure children and adolescents are equitably considered and protected as AI grows across the planet.

243447,StarEdu,7,17/01/2021,The dark side of AI,"Technology enlightens, but it also gives rise to critical questions about the relationship between humans and humanoids","WE are now experiencing a new era. The 4.0 Industrial Revolution has created the momentum for fundamental changes in all aspects of our socio-economic and personal lives. 
The pandemic accelerates many of these changes. One theme that has emerged is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in society and, in particular, its impact on education. 
In simple language, AI refers to any device with varying levels of human intelligence. At an elementary level, the device may just automate routine tasks. It can be improved with assisted intelligence to make decisions and perform tasks. 
It can also be further improved with augmented intelligence to become a human decision making automation. 
One notch up is autonomous intelligence which is capable of adapting and acting without human assistance. Humans can use AI, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to improve all aspects of our lives. In sum, ML is an approach to achieve AI, and DL is a technique for implementing ML. 
So, how does AI facilitate the education process? AI helps by facilitating accessing, scaffolding, scaling, and accelerating education development. It provides the functional efficiency in managing learning systems.
AI can help to design intelligent tutoring systems with smart content to achieve smart outcomes. At the same time, it facilitates the development of individualised and personalised learning that is supported by learning analytics. Learning can be cumulative as it can be done in bytes. This creates scalable globalised learning. 
However, introducing AI into the classroom is more than a technology issue. There are challenges revolving around the integration and immersion of AI into the classroom culture. 
Using AI means interfacing the learning and teaching pedagogy into a new context that teachers must learn to be adept at. It is a sociological issue concerning a community of teachers, designers and learners. 
As the student-teacher relationship is a sensitive one, whether or not the use of AI technology is successful depends on the ability of teachers to create a suitable environment for it to take off. 
Teachers must thus learn to interpret technology as a social construct in the classroom culture. As AI is just a platform, teachers must engage students to use reflexive conversations in subject-specific and learner-specific contexts. In such situations they must anticipate the positive outcomes and other unintended effects.
Without a doubt, AI would facilitate management and functional efficiencies and help to reduce the cost of delivering quality education on a larger scale. This way, teachers are released from doing routine chores and can thus spend their precious time on other meaningful tasks.
We teach AI as a competency to solve problems. In China, they start teaching AI to five-year old children. These children grow to be AI-driven students and later, adults.
But the bigger question is how does AI impact such individuals and society at large? This concerns the critical interrogation of the ethical and sociological impact on individuals and mankind.
AI will continue its technological evolution in an inexorable growth.  Society will have to co-exist with humanoids as technology continues its triumphal march. But as much as AI enlightens, it also creates dark uncertainties.
Some critical classroom questions concern the relationship between humans and humanoids. As education is an emancipatory process and experience, what and how can it enlighten students and society about many unasked questions? Is the use of AI optional or obligatory? Should it be forbidden in some cases and for some areas? If education is to liberate us from ignorance and prejudices, then the teaching of AI should not be all about its functionality. 
How does AI help us to emote and empathise, decide right from wrong, nurture creativity and compassion? How do we ensure it does not deform the natural development of a child’s learning experience? For example, will AI destroy the experience of a child in learning a language since it can accelerate the learning of languages, or replace the need and necessity to learn languages? Learning languages is a core evolutionary function in the development experience of human beings. Will this evolutionary function be destroyed?
While AI can enhance the logical component of education, can it help to develop a human being to love and feel without being structured by algorithm guidelines? Can AI enable a person to have higher appreciation of Shakespeare’s love sonnets? 
AI can most likely help to understand and may resolve the pandemic challenges, but can it explain the philosophical co-existence of nature and man and the virus? Can it help us to grasp the meaning of life and death? Can it answer why we live? Is there a spiritual content in AI?
As AI invades our socio-economic and personal life, how do we humans answer our own yearning to understand our purpose in life, or the purpose of life? Will it all end in absurdity — having humanoids co-exist with us without knowing the meaning of what to live for?

243065,StarBiz 7,4,16/01/2021,IoT and AI buy  Silterra some time,Nuglobal Ventures sees opportunity in loss-making chip maker due to demand for 200mm wafer fabs,"THE semiconductor industry went through a major downturn in 2018 and 2019 due to an inventory glut, but it has since started to bounce off from that situation.
The recovery coincided with the global economy’s enemy number one, Covid-19, which sent almost a third of the global workforce scurrying to work from home, but that saw an increased demand in hardware alongside the wide adoption of digital measures.
The protracting trade tensions between the United States and China have evolved the semiconductor supply chain and created a shortage in the market, forcing China to be more self-sufficient and source for alternatives as demand for chips starts to grow alongside the heightening demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-things (IOT) devices, and this is where Malaysia, among other countries, is set to benefit.
Malaysia’s strength in the semiconductor space lies in the back-end of the chain such as packaging, testing and assembly. The nation’s front-end presence comes through Silterra Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which though not in a very good shape, remains a vital component in the electrical and electronics (E&E) ecosystem. 
It is the loss-making wafer foundry that Khazanah Nasional Bhd has been trying to dispose since early last year.
Nuglobal Ventures Sdn Bhd sees an opportunity in Silterra due to the new lease of life for 200mm wafer fabs, which is within the chip maker’s manufacturing capability and beyond. Its director Md Radzi Din tells StarBizWeek that the rise in demand for AI and IOT devices has led to a surge in 200mm wafers since 2015 due to its more mature processes and demand for analogue semiconductors. 
NGV is an investment holding company that leads a consortium comprising local and foreign investors bidding for Silterra. The majority of NGV is controlled by local and bumiputra shareholders including Radzi, while its foreign partner, Orient Excellent – a China-based private equity fund – holds the remaining stake.  
The local funding for the exercise will be provided by a private equity technology fund promoted by Green Packet Bhd, with access to a funding pool of up to RM500mil. The technology fund has received a committed funding of RM100mil from Green Packet while additional funds will come from third-party investors, including Kendall Court Ventures Ltd.
It will provide funding to local and bumiputra shareholders under an arms-length commercial instrument, which will be paid down over time through returns from the investment or other alternative funding secured in the future. 
In return, the technology fund will receive periodic coupon or dividends from the local and bumiputra shareholders. “There’s a shortage of 200mm chips in the marketplace, and in fact, some of the wafer fabs are scrambling to install 200mm lines.
“The challenge is that 200mm line equipment is also hard to come by. So, that’s very good news for Silterra in the sense that they have a new lease of life for the 200mm but it does not preclude Silterra from needing to think about the future. They will need a 300mm line eventaully,” he says. 
Radzi adds that what the NGV consortium brings to the table is ensuring that the majority ownership of Silterra remains in local hands with bumiputra ownership. He stresses that it is of national interest for its control to remain local, as Silterra is a strategic national asset that plays a pivotal role in the domestic semiconductor, and by extension, the larger E&E sub-sector.
“Secondly, the consortium will bring in the critical business and technological partner expertise and financial strength to grow and scale the development of Silterra, to achieve sustainable long-term success and contribute to the buoyancy of the semiconductor and E&E ecosystem.
“We have the necessary instruments in place to carry out the needed cash and capital injection into Silterra to deliver the turnaround business plan and future growth that we have in mind,” he says.
This includes continued financial support to Silterra to navigate changes in market conditions where the company will need to invest and remain relevant and competitive.
Silterra requires cash and capital injection to scale and turnaround, with further investments needed to fuel its future growth.
“This is where the future funding must be in place. What it does with the current AI and IOT demand for the 200mm type of chips rejuvenates its operations  and we must use that time to already plan for what’s next. 
“It will probably be a combination of the 200mm and the lines will need to be refreshed to make sure we can still produce the highest quality for the 200mm types but we must also look at the 300mm,” Radzi says.
Explaining further on NGV’s value proposition, Radzi adds that its local and foreign consortium partners have a firm interest in the development of the 2,428ha (6,000 acres) Asia Semiconductor Hub (ASH) in Kulim, in close proximity to Silterra, to create an end-to-end semiconductor ecosystem that will drive technology innovation and spur regional socio-economic growth.
Green Packet, the promoter of the technology fund, via its associate company G3 Global Bhd, is also planning the development of the first AI Park in Malaysia in collaboration with China’s SenseTime Group and China Harbour Engineering Company.
“Both the ASH and AI Park will form a strategic and synergistic triple node with Silterra that will significantly impact the national agenda of IR4.0.
“We are able to visualise and are committed to the opportunities and potential within Silterra, and the larger growth vision that will allow Silterra to maintain its global competitiveness among the world’s largest foundries, bolster its unique position and thereby increase Malaysia’s value-added contribution to the global E&E sector,” he says.
While Chinese firms are good in product development, they lack in the area of integrated circuit (IC) design and in Penang, there are close to 6,000 IC designers. “We are strong in IC and the front end is relatively weak, but our back-end is very strong. If we make Silterra strong again, the whole value chain will strengthen and the ASH can create a very vibrant northern corridor in the E&E sector,” he adds.
Radzi says NGV is able to leverage on Green Packet’s extensive telecommunication and technology devices industry expertise with wide local networks in Malaysia, Singapore and China and operational experience in managing global electronic supply chain.
Green Packet’s internal transformation resource and its subject matter partners will also assist NGV to develop a targeted and robust strategic and execution plan for the turnaround and growth of Silterra.
He adds that NGV can also tap on Orient Excellent and other foreign partners which include some of the largest distributors of semiconductor components and electronic conglomerates in China.",semiconductor industry major downturn inventory glut bounce situation recovery global economy enemy covid global workforce increased demand hardware alongside wide adoption digital measure trade tension china semiconductor supply chain shortage market china sufficient source alternative chip start demand artificial intelligence internet iot device malaysia country benefit malaysia strength semiconductor space chain packaging nation front presence silterra malaysia sdn bhd shape vital component electrical electronics loss wafer foundry khazanah nasional bhd dispose nuglobal venture bhd opportunity silterra lease life fabs chip maker manufacturing capability director radzi din tell rise demand iot device surge wafer process analogue semiconductor ngv investment company consortium local foreign investor silterra majority local bumiputra shareholder radzi foreign partner orient excellent china private equity fund stake local funding exercise private equity technology fund green packet bhd access funding pool mil technology fund committed funding mil green packet additional fund party investor kendall court venture local bumiputra shareholder arm commercial instrument time return investment alternative funding future return technology fund periodic coupon dividend local bumiputra shareholder chip marketplace fabs install line equipment hard news silterra sense lease life silterra future radzi ngv consortium table majority ownership silterra local hand bumiputra ownership national control local silterra strategic national asset play pivotal role domestic semiconductor extension larger sector consortium bring critical business technological partner expertise financial strength scale development silterra sustainable term success contribute buoyancy semiconductor ecosystem instrument cash capital injection turnaround business plan future growth mind continued financial support silterra market condition company relevant competitive silterra cash capital injection scale turnaround investment fuel future growth future funding current iot demand type chip operation time plan combination line quality type radzi ngv proposition radzi local foreign consortium partner firm development acre semiconductor hub ash close proximity silterra create semiconductor drive technology innovation regional socio economic growth green packet promoter technology fund associate company global bhd planning development park malaysia collaboration china sensetime china harbour engineering company ash park form strategic synergistic triple node silterra impact national agenda visualise opportunity potential silterra larger growth vision silterra maintain global competitiveness largest foundry bolster unique position increase malaysia contribution global sector chinese firm product development lack circuit design penang close designer strong front weak strong silterra strong chain strengthen ash create vibrant northern corridor sector radzi ngv leverage green packet extensive telecommunication technology device industry expertise wide local network china operational experience global electronic supply chain green packet internal transformation resource subject matter partner ngv develop robust strategic execution plan growth ngv tap orient excellent foreign partner largest distributor semiconductor component electronic conglomerate,"[(0, 0.06426656), (6, 0.9336509)]",6
240585,StarBiz,5,11/01/2021,Better demand for AI video surveillance products,,"PETALING JAYA: The prolonged Covid-19 pandemic will help translate to better demand for artificial intelligence (AI) video surveillance products and services, said  Gamma Solution Sdn Bhd’s business development manager Sim Tiong Yan.
“We are actually expecting strong demand and double-digit growth this year. The pandemic can help spur the adoption of AI video surveillance technology. This industry can keep growing,” Sim told StarBiz.
“Some clusters have originated in the construction and manufacturing industries in which there are useful applications for such a technology to be deployed,” he added.
Sim, who spoke at the Transforming Security and Business Efficiency with AI Video Surveillance that was organised by Star Media Group last week, said that there are other industries that could benefit from this as well.
“Facial recognition can be used for logistics warehousing and university campuses as well for features such as body temperature detection,” he said. “AI can help in the implementation of the necessary standard operating procedures,” Sim added.
He said the company’s customers today come from other segments as well, including banks, data centres and retail. He noted that AI video surveillance is an alternative method to help organise people without human intervention.
“When we apply facial recognition, we can set a specific criteria for a group of people who are unwelcomed: blacklist or whitelist. Those who are in this blacklist would not be able to access the premises,” Sim said.
He said other modes available for AI video surveillance includes dual factor authentication with an option to integrate into the door access system and security closed circuit TV cameras. “In this sense with a camera, a worker or student can only access say a particular room when they themselves are in front of an entry point,” Sim said.
He said that business could also do better should the pandemic eventually resolve with the vaccines. “The growth can be stronger from various industries next year and I am quite optimistic of this,” Sim said.",jaya covid pandemic translate demand artificial intelligence video surveillance product service gamma solution sdn bhd business development manager sim yan strong demand double digit growth pandemic spur adoption video surveillance technology industry sim starbiz cluster construction manufacturing industry application technology sim security business efficiency video surveillance star medium week industry facial recognition logistics university campus body temperature detection implementation standard operating procedure company customer segment bank data centre retail video surveillance alternative method organise people human intervention facial recognition specific criterion people unwelcomed blacklist whitelist blacklist access sim mode video surveillance dual factor authentication option integrate door access system security circuit camera sense camera worker student access front entry sim business resolve vaccine growth stronger industry optimistic sim,"[(2, 0.9917341)]",2
238169,Lifestyle,4,04/01/2021,EU rights watchdog warns of pitfalls in use of AI,,"The European Union’s rights watchdog has warned of the risks of using artificial intelligence in predictive policing, medical ­diagnoses and targeted advertising as the bloc mulls rules this year to address the challenges posed by the technology.
While AI is widely used by law enforcement agencies, rights groups say it is also abused by authoritarian regimes for mass and discriminatory surveillance. Critics also worry about the ­violation of people’s fundamental rights and data privacy rules.
The Vienna-based EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) urged policymakers in a report issued on Dec 14 to provide more guidance on how existing rules apply to AI and ensure that future AI laws protect fundamental rights.
“AI is not infallible, it is made by people – and humans can make mistakes. That is why people need to be aware when AI is used, how it works and how to challenge automated decisions,” FRA ­director Michael O’Flaherty said in a statement.
FRA’s report comes as the European Commission, the EU executive, considers legislation in 2021 to cover so-called high risk sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport and parts of the public sector.
The agency said AI rules must respect all fundamental rights, with safeguards to ensure this and include a guarantee that people can challenge decisions taken by AI and that companies need to be able to explain how their systems take AI decisions.
It also said there should be more research into the potentially discriminatory effects of AI so Europe can guard against it, and the bloc must further clarify how data protection rules apply to the technology.
FRA’s report is based on more than 100 interviews with public and private organisations already using AI, with the analysis based on uses of AI in Estonia, Finland, France, the Netherlands and Spain. – Reuters",european union right warned risk artificial intelligence predictive medical diagnosis advertising bloc mull rule challenge technology law enforcement agency right authoritarian regime discriminatory surveillance critic violation people fundamental right data privacy rule agency fundamental right urged policymakers dec provide guidance rule future law fundamental right infallible people human people aware challenge decision director michael flaherty statement fra report european commission executive considers legislation cover risk sector energy transport public sector agency rule fundamental right safeguard guarantee people decision company system decision discriminatory effect guard bloc data protection rule technology fra report interview public private organisation analysis estonia finland france spain reuters,"[(1, 0.7595652), (2, 0.2313406)]",1
